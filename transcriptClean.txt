                    Another big night, fellas $ 164.87.
 That's not a lot of money.
 No, it isn't.
 And our mortgage is due in two weeks.
 We paid that a week ago. A week ago was three weeks late, Mac. Hey, guys. I met this guy in acting class. He's really cool, and he wants to see where I work. So could you guys try to not be weird?
 What is that supposed to mean?
 I love you guys, but sometimes you're not that cool.
 We're cool!
 Not cool?
 Try to be cool.
 Sometimes you're not too cool.
 Charlie
 Always cool, man.
 Oh, hey, man, we're closed.
 Yeah, I know.
 Whoa, whoa, whoa! We don't want any trouble.
 What? Guys, this is Terrell from my acting class.
 Yeah. Yeah.
 Hey, man. How's it goin'?
 It's going good. How you doin'?
 Good, man.
 We're just chillin', dude.
 Great.
 Just closing up shop.
 Yeah. Whoa. Guess you guys don't have too many brothers walking through here.
 Oh, no, no.
 We got plenty of brothers. Yeah A-African-Americans. Okay. Yeah, we get it. You might know some of them. Yeah. We're probably related. No. I don't think he was implying that you guys are all related. That's ridiculous. Sweet Dee came in here a second ago and started talking about acting class.
 We weren't expecting you
 We weren't expecting you to be black, that's all. Right. Thanks, guys. When I'm promotin', everybody and their mama gonna be there. There's gonna be brothers, white boys, Latinos, whatever. You got niggas hanging from the rafters. So we got 400-plus packed into this tiny little place Whoa. You had 400 people packed into a place? You damn right. That's my job, man. And it's mostly college kids. My sister goes to Temple, so I got the hookup over there. And hookups are good. But, just to be clear, when you say your sister, do you mean your sister or your friend
 Dude.
 Oh, Jesus.
 I mean my sister.
 Oh. Okay. Cool. I was just Because he could mean his friend or his Stop talking. So we're packed into this little place on Walnut. We're halfway through the night, everything's goin' all right. All of a sudden, I notice this dude eyeballin' me from across the bar.
 Shit.
 I don't know if this dude wants to freak me or fight me.
 He's giving you crazy eyes.
 The insane, crazy eyes.
 Right?
 I know that. So I walk over He's this big, cut Mexican dude and I look at him and say, "Yo, ese unless you want to get yo' ass torn apart you'd better get that look off your face."
 No!
 You just walked right up to him and said that? I had to, man. You gotta make the first move.
 Always make the first move. You know what I'm sayin'?
 L-I know.
 So what happened?
 Well, hey, he won't stop starin' me down. We're, like, eyeball to eyeball. His grill is right up in mine. It feels like an eternity. Finally he just opens up his mouth and says "I guess you gon' have to tear my ass apart, homes." Oh, man. So what'd you do? Took him to the back alley and I tore his ass apart! Oh, my God! That's insane! Okay, I would like to do things like that. I love that guy. "I took him to the back alley"?
 Who does shit like that? It's like a movie.
 There's something off about him.
 Oh, bro, that's racist.
 No, asshole, that's not what I meant.
 I'll go get the coffee. What do you guys want?
 Dude, sit down. Okay? Wait till the waitress comes out here, and then you can stare at her.
 I wasn't gonna stare at her. I was just gonna
 He wasn't gonna stare at her.
 You're totally obsessed with that chick.
 No, I'm not. I like her. I have a little bit of a crush, yes. But obsessed? That's a bit of a harsh word.
 It's never gonna happen.
 Honestly, I think we should think about hiring Terrell.
 Why? For what?
 You heard him. When he's promotin', everybody named Mama's looking to get in. That's true. They do have "niggers hanging from rafters."
 Wow. Nice.
 No, that's not what I was saying.
 Coffee?
 Yeah.
 Hitler?
 No, I'm not I'm not Adolf Hitler.
 I'll make sure to put lots of cream in yours.
 I was quoting a black friend. Okay. Well, that's just great.
 Now she thinks I'm racist.
 Dude, will you just drop it? Listen, ifTerrell delivers half of what he promises, we're looking at 200 people.
 Yeah, that's true.
 It'd be nice to get some chicks in the bar. All right, let's do it.
 Sure about this?
 It's 2005, Charlie. Don't you think it's ridiculous that you have no friends outside of your own race?
 No, what is ridiculous is this stupid plan.
 It's not stupid!
 It's a stupid plan.
 It's not This is a college campus. This is a great place to meet people of different cultures, diversify You're just trying to make black Mm-hmm. You're trying to make black friends.
 You're not making it easy.
 You're trying to impress Terrell with a couple of black friends. Don't do this right now. Okay. See? This is exactly what I'm talking about.
 This is perfect.
 Huh. Yeah.
 I'm gonna break the ice.
 Go for it. 'Bout to bust that shit up, Reese. 'Bout to bust that shit up, boy! Absolutely.
 Okay, that didn't go exactly the way
 No.
 No. It was really awkward.
 Really awkward.
 Maybe we should go.
 Yeah!
 Hey, what's your name?
 Oh. It's, uh, Charlie. Do you play bones, Charlie? I dabble. Do you want to play? I could get you a game. Uh, no, I shouldn't. I'm not very good, so
 I bet you're really good.
 Well, it's been a long time, you know.
 Oh, come on.
 All right. One game. Domino, bitch! This is bullshit. Absolute bullshit.
 Why do these people like you more than they like me?
 Maybe it's comments like that. I meant those people in there, not all black people. What am I supposed to say? You should say something different. Figure something else out.
 Hey.
 Hey.
 Um, I'm Janell.
 Oh, hi.
 Uh, you got some moves out there, Charlie.
 Thanks. You know. I wanted to give you this.
 Oh. Okay.
 You know?
 Give me a call sometime. All right?
 Yeah. Sure. Well, you
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you doing, dude?
 What? That girl's gorgeous. She's the perfect opportunity to prove we're not racist. She probably has friends for me. Well, if anything, I think we should be focused on black men, first of all. What? We don't really need We need black guys, so
 Black guys? What are you talking about?
 You know. Is this about that waitress at the coffee shop, dude?
 Oh, my God!
 What?
 Dude, you are obsessed with this chick.
 No, I'm not.
 Let me see your wallet.
 Why?
 Are you still carrying a picture of her in your wallet?
 No. Give it to me. Give it Oh, my God! Stop making a scene! Just give me the wallet! Give me the wallet! I can't get the goddamn It's okay! It's okay, everybody!
 You're making a scene.
 You're making a scene! I got it. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Hold on a second.
 Ha! Ha-ha! Ha!
 Give it to me! He had it! Okay! You found it!
 I'm gonna tear it up!
 No, don't! Just give me it. I'll call the black girl. Okay? Okay, buddy. We're cool. We're cool. We're good. Thanks, guys. See ya. I had the craziest dream last night that I was in Cleveland, Ohio which is really weird, because I've never even been to Ohio. This guy was wearing a bunny suit, and he was coming out You know what, Dee? I don't wanna hear about your dreams. Okay? I hate listening to people's dreams. It's like flipping through a stack of photographs. If I'm not in any of'em and nobody's having sex, I just I don't care. Oh. I'm sorry. I would listen to your dreams.
 'Cause your my brother and I love you.
 I'm sorry. I am.
 Hey! What's goin' on, guys?
 Terrell.
 How are you?
 Hey! What's up? What's up? How you doin'? Dennis! What's goin' on?
 All right, man.
 How's it goin', man? Good, man. Listen, um, you mind stepping outside with me for a second, man?
 Yeah, I'll come outside.
 Yeah?
 Yeah.
 All right. Well, come on. I'm gonna put these out on the tables. Rule number one: Always keep a line. Oh, my God! That is a lot of people! Wow!
 This is crazy!
 I know! I told you! Terrell's the best! I'm gonna have to start bartending full-time. L-Look at this!
 Why are you making more money than me?
 I don't know!
 Hey, this is crazy!
 I know. Terrell packed 'em in. Look at this.
 This is crazy!
 Yeah, dude, we were just saying that.
 Lot of dudes.
 Yeah, there's a lot of dudes. Lot of dudes. What can I get you boys?
 Oh, uh, we wanted to wait for the cute one.
 What cute one? Mac, isn't that your cousin Brett by the jukebox?
 Oh, yeah!
 Let's go say hey.
 Yo, Brettie boy!
 Hey, cuz!
 Hey! How you doin'?
 What's up, Brett? Can you believe this crowd?
 Oh, it's something else!
 Yeah! Gentlemen, I understand my services have been requested. I actually got a couple of services I'd like to request. Whoa! Uh, what are you doin, man? I'm not
 You have the most beautiful eyes.
 Okay, man, but I'm Really? So blue. Really more of a blue-green, actually, but
 I'm really proud of you, man.
 Yeah, thanks.
 You've come a long way.
 What do you mean? You guys are running the hottest gay bar in Philadelphia. No! What in the hell is your problem? How could you not tell me you were gay? I'm a musical theater actor living in Philadelphia. I didn't think it was that big a secret. I've been coming on to you for weeks now.
 Just thought you were into gay dudes.
 I am not into gay dudes!
 Apparently you are.
 Okay, well, you know what? The guys hired you to promote their bar, and you turned it into a gay bar. They are not happy.
 So much money!
 Whoo! Oh! So much money! We made more money in one night Th-Than in the entire time that we've owned this place! We have to embrace the situation. We should totally embrace the situation!
 We're a gay bar from now on.
 Absolutely, man! No goddamn way. Have you guys seen this? "Looking for that new hot spot to spot that stud? Well, Paddy's Irish Pub has plugged that hole."
 That's a nice notice.
 No, it's not nice. I don't want to be plugging anybody's holes.
 I'm gonna have to agree with Mac.
 Of course you are. I made $300 last night. How much did you make? First of all, that's rude. And that has nothing to do with what I'm talking about. It has everything to do with it. I don't think we have much of a choice. We need to do this. If you guys remember, one of the major reasons we got this bar was to get laid. Maybe you did it to get laid. I got a little something I like to call business ethics. Business ethics? The only reason you don't care is you have black girls hanging all over you. Okay, chill out. You're gonna screw it up. Screw it up? I happen to have a date with a nice young lady today.
 Ouch.
 It's a purely fiscal decision. Oh, bullshit. You don't care about the money. You just like the attention.
 What the hell is that supposed to mean?
 "Everybody look at me!" You know exactly what I mean, pretty boy.
 Hey, handsome.
 Hey, beautiful.
 Hey, sexy.
 Hey, hoss.
 I just get along really well with those guys.
 They're vibing. No, you're leading them on. You're not gay, you're just really vain. Okay, time out. Here's what we should do. Let's take a vote.
 Fine.
 Okay. All those in favor of Paddy's Pub remaining a gay bar, say "aye."
 Aye.
 Aye. Opposed?
 K-K-Keeping in mind that you don't get a vote.
 Why?
 Because you're the bartender. You're not one of the owners.
 No, Sweet Dee gets a vote.
 No, she doesn't!
 Of course I get a vote! All owners opposed, say "nay." All people who own the bar who are opposed, say "nay." All people who own the bar who are opposed say "nay." Nay.
 Two against one! Oh, well.
 Ohh! Paddy's Irish Pub will henceforth remain the hottest gay bar in Philadelphia.
 Hey-hey! What's going on?
 Hey!
 Look at you! You look good!
 Oh, thank you. That's so sweet.
 So, where we going?
 Well, I thought we'd go grab a drink.
 Oh, I want one so bad.
 All righty! Oh, a coffee shop. I thought you meant, like, a drink at a bar. Yeah, absolutely. Uh, why don't you have a seat here. I'll go get the coffee. What would you like?
 I don't really drink coffee. Let me see.
 Totally. What do you want, Charlie? "What do you want, Charlie?" I'd like you to take a look at the lovely young African-American woman sitting at the table over there. Okay. That woman is my friend. Wow. Good for you. So, the other day when you heard me saying something about certain people hanging from said rafters I was quoting a friend of mine who also happens What are you trying to say? Spit it out. Well, now that you know that I'm not racist, you and I could maybe go on Dude, N-O.
 How many times do I have to say it to you?
 One time is fine.
 Apparently one time is not fine.
 One time per time I ask you. Hey, what's going on up here? Oh, not too much. Charlie's using you to prove that he's not racist. Then he asked me out on a date. Charlie, is this true? Would that upset you if it was something that was true?
 You need to see a doctor. This thing looks really bad.
 I did!
 What'd he say?
 He said thatJanell punched me in my eye! All right, well, you need to keep that i
 Wait. Her name's Janell?
 Yeah. JanellJenkins. She's got a hell of a right hand. She also said if she ever saw me again, she was going to slit my throat. Are you two seeing this? Boys are out tonight, huh? This is unbelievable. What is going on here? You got black women crawling all over you and this Mary here is the belle of the ball.
 Why do these people like you guys so much?
 It's not that they like us. It's that they don't like you. You know why? Uh, because you're an asshole! Is that true? Yeah, kind of. Can I talk to you in back for a second?
 What's up?
 You know that girlJanell? I know her.
 Okay. So what?
 So I think I know how we can solve this whole gay mess. Great. How? We gotta start with Dennis. Can you get him so drunk tonight? On tequila. But a lot of it. Enough that maybe he might hurt himself.
 Yeah, sure. No problem.
 All right.
 Where are you going?
 I gotta talk to a couple friends from my acting class. But seriously blackout drunk. All right. Okay. So you did the lime first, and then the shot, right? No. No, no, no, no. Dude.
 You take the salt
 Take the salt. And then you take the shot. Okay.
 And then you suck on the lime. Okay?
 Okay. Why don't you show me again. 'Cause I'm getting a little bit confused.
 You lick it.
 Salt. Lick it.
 And then you slam it.
 Yeah? Oh, that's great. All right, so, I'm gonna do the shot first No, no, no, no Oh Oh, please, please, dude. You're not listening to me. Well, I'm just not getting it, bro.
 You do the salt first.
 The salt first.
 And then the lime.
 Show me again, because I'm not The salt first. Then the lime. Oh, God. Hello. Mmm. Nice. Beautiful. Hello, lover. Whoa! What the hell! What is going on here? Relax, stud. You got nothing to be ashamed about. What the f What does that mean?
 Did we have
 No. No. Don't be silly. It was all hands. How's that ass feelin'? I'm really glad you decided to embrace this.
 You're doing the right thing, bro.
 I think so too, dude.
 I feel really good about broadening my horizons.
 It's gonna be fun.
 It's a good business decision.
 Yeah! I don't want to own a gay bar anymore. What, dude? Oh, no. What happened? Just, uh I was doing some thinking and, you know We had our little experiment. It was great. But we should go back to normal. Oh. You had an experiment, and you want to go back to the way it was before the experiment.
 Interesting.
 The bar. We had our experiment with the bar, and it was great. Let's go back to normal. You're done experimenting? Or are you gonna experiment some more?
 What is this experimenting?
 Hey, Dennis! What's up? Listen, I got you some new CDs. 'Cause the music you had in the jukebox was a little bit stale. Also, we gotta get rid of these shamrocks. 'Cause nothing scares gays and black folks like Irish crap.
 Can we talk for a second in private?
 Yeah. No problem. So, listen, Terrell, it's not really working out.
 We're gonna have to let you go.
 I thought you were happy. No, we were happy. But then Dennis had an experiment, and he wants to go back to normal. Yeah, we had that experiment Why do you keep saying it like that? You guys are being ridiculous. Yeah, we're being ridiculous! We're making a lot of money!
 Yes! Thank you!
 Look, everybody! Sweet Dee's here!
 Hey, everybody!
 Whoa! Whoa! What are you doing here?
 Charlie?
 What is going on here? You guys know each other? Yeah! That's the crazy bitch that punched me in my eye! Charlie! That's my sister. Now, just to clarify, when you say "sister," you mean I mean my sister. Yes! Okay! This is great! Because earlier you were implying that I was racist because you thought that I was implying that all black people are related. And then it turns out that you people actually are! No, that's not what I meant. Hold on a second. I meant that you two actually are. Mac? Stop talkin'. Hundred and 11, hundred and 12, hundred and 13 $114!
 On a Saturday night!
 We're back to normal. We are back to normal. Mmm. Dee, I gotta know. What, exactly, did you tell those guys from your acting class to do to Dennis? Oh, I forgot to tell you. That didn't work out.
 What?
 Yeah, I couldn't get ahold of those guys. Then why was he so freaked out? How's that ass feelin'?                       No, dude. It's not It's not a question of individual style. It's about having some taste. You're attacking my ability to express myself, dude. How am I attacking your ability to I just don't get it. What's not to get? "Come to Philly for the crack."
 It has a picture of the Liberty Bell on it.
 Yeah, but
 It's funny and original.
 It's not fun How is it funny and original? Every asshole on South Street's wearing a T-shirt with an ironic slogan on it. Well, excuse me if all my T-shirts don't have a little guy playing polo on the lapel. You cut the sleeves off of all your T-shirts. What, so you can show off your tats? Those are really original, dude.
 They're tribal.
 Oh, they're trib I'm sorry. What tribe are you from?
 What? Is it, like, an Indian tribe or
 Okay, okay, okay.
 You guys gonna let me in this game or what?
 No. You're the ref.
 I don't want to ref anymore. I'd like to play, so
 You're an excellent ref.
 You're a very good ref.
 Yeah, I know. I'm a great ref. I'd like to play the game now.
 Are you gonna get mad? You gonna turn into the mad munchkin?
 What's the ma
 Do you represent the Lollipop Guild, Charlie?
 Do you? Hey, Charlie.
 That's a mad munchkin dance? Oh, okay. This is what we do?
 I need to talk to you. It's about our son! Nobody wants to hear that.
 So, wait, she's sayin'this is your son?
 I don't know.
 Sounds like a bunch of bullshit to me, Charlie.
 I know! I know it. There's, like, no way that this is possible.
 Well, did you have sex with her?
 Yeah. Okay. Did you use birth control?
 Oh, Dee, we went to Catholic school, so
 Okay. You're allowed to have premarital sex, but you're not allowed to use birth control? No. All right. You're twisting words here and, like, gettin' cute. When did she have this kid?
 It's been, like, 10 years since I've even seen her, so
 Ten years?
 What does she want?
 Well, that's that's the weird thing. She doesn't want money or anything. She just wants me to meet him.
 Are you gonna do it?
 No. Well, dude, you gotta meet the kid. I mean, you gotta find out for sure. Yeah, I guess. It's just I mean, I wish I could go back in time and do the right thing, you know?
 Like be there for him?
 No. Get her an abortion. So you're not allowed to use birth control, but abortions are no problem? All right. Okay. So now you're, like, a word genius. And everything I say, you twist it around and make me look dumb. Charlie's right though. He should have at least had a say in the matter.
 It's her body, and it's her decision.
 No, I'm sorry. It's not just her decision. The man should get a vote.
 Okay. Well, ultimately it's her choice.
 It is not just her choice. It's nobody's choice. It should be left up to God. Is he Is that Are you joking? No, it's not a joke! You remember Genesis, Book Two, Verse Three? "And he breathed into the nostrils of Adam on the first day. And it was good." Right in his nostrils, huh? Sounds really uncomfortable. You're making an asshole out of yourself. Dude, you need to get a blood test, okay?
 I remember Stacy Corvelli. She was a slut.
 You're right. You're right. Uh, Mac, what's God's stance on blood tests? Hmm. I don't know. I'd have to check. All right, you feeling good? No. I feel nauseous. I think I'm gonna go. I'm gonna run.
 No, no, no. It's
 I should go.
 Hi. Hey, Charlie.
 Hi.
 Hey.
 You brought your, uh Uh, Dennis Reynolds. We didn't get a chance to talk before, but I remember you. Yeah.
 You went to St. Giles?
 I did. Yeah.
 Ah.
 With Yeah. So you two are together now, or
 No.
 No. No.
 No. I'm just here for moral support.
 Yeah, we're not That's not even a
 I brought him along.
 Yeah.
 So
 All right. Come on in. I'm real glad you decided to do this, Charlie. Yeah. Well, uh, you know, it's the least I could do, so Yeah. Sorry I don't have a lot of time. I gotta get to work. Uh, Tommy, come on in here, Son! What do you want, Mom? He's a bit of a handful. Uh, Charlie and his friend are here. So goddamn what? Tommy, come in here, please! This is bullshit.
 Whoa!
 Language, please.
 Which one of you fags is supposed to be my dad?
 Whoa, hello.
 Right off the bat with the
 Yeah. Tommy, be nice. Huh? This is Charlie. Are you serious? This is the guy? What's that What's that supposed to mean, buddy? Okay. Well, I should be home around 8:00. Uh, what do you guys have planned?
 Uh, I thought we'd go to the park.
 Huh. That sounds nice.
 Wanna go to the park, Tommy?
 I don't care. Okay. That's great. Bye, sweetie. Have fun, boys. I'm not goin' to the park. No shit. What is this place? Uh, this is a place where we're gonna go see a special friend of mine.
 Why?
 'Cause he's gonna help us figure something very important out.
 It's gonna be good to know.
 Why?
 Because I said so. No more questions, okay, buddy?
 Why?
 Stop saying "why."
 Why?
 Stop it. I don't like this game.
 Why? Why?
 Is this a game? This is your game?
 Why? Why? Hey, pretty boy. What you here for? My friend's gettin' a blood test. Your boyfriend? No. He's not my He's not my boyfriend. He got Al DS? I don't I don't think so.
 Do you?
 No, I don't. I'll blow you for $10. You know what? Let me consult some of this free literature they got here regarding that proposition. Oh. You know what? According to this, that's not really a good idea. So I'm gonna have to pass. But thanks. I appreciate it. Really nice of you.
 He's playin' mind games, dude.
 I wanna leave.
 Hey, it's tough.
 What are we doin' here? Don't answer that. It's a trick question. He tries to get in your head.
 It's a little game he plays.
 No, let let me answer the question. See, we're at a free clinic, Tommy. Charlie doesn't have health insurance. See this lady back here? Take a look. That's what you get when you don't have health insurance.

 If you don't buy me anything I'm gonna tell my mom you took me to a black people's house.
 Okay.
 Wow! Oh, my God, that's racist. What do you say to that?
 I don't say anything.
 You still have to buy me a toy! Charlie, what in the hell are you gonna do if this kid's yours? Oh, I don't know. I'll probably, uh, kill myself. Whoa! Isn't that your waitress from the coffee shop? Cool. Stewie.

 Cool. This is my, uh
 Friend. We're good friends.
 Hi.
 Hi.
 Is that cute little girl your
 I'm her big sister. Oh. Hmm, that's weird. She looks Mexican. She is Mexican. It's the Big Sister program. She's not my real little sister. That is such a coincidence. That's exactly what we're here doing.
 What?
 Yeah. Do you see that, um adorable little guy over there? That's Charlie's little brother.
 Really?
 Mm-hmm.
 Yeah.
 No way. You're involved in the program? Yeah! Well, that's I didn't know you were involved in the program.
 I love the program!
 It's one of his favorite programs.
 Yeah. I've I've been in the program since
 A long time now. I guess you're gonna be going to the picnic then at Fairmount Park.
 Right.
 Saturday?
 Saturday.
 Yeah. Are you there? Are you goin'? Are you gonna be there?
 I will be there on Saturday, yes.
 Great.
 Maybe we'll see you there.
 Maybe. Or you know what?
 Or maybe we could carpool. You know what I mean?
 Carpool? Yeah. Well, come on. Think about it. We'll save the environment.
 We'll team up. It'll be good.
 This is smart. Reduce, reuse, recycle.
 You should do it.
 The kids will love it. The kids He loves Mexicans. All right.
 Sure. Let's do it.
 Oh!
 Okay. Yeah.
 Great.
 Great. Okay, well
 Nice to meet you too. I'll see you.
 I gotta go get my little sister. Okay, bye.
 Bye.
 Thank you.
 You're still pretty sweaty. Baby killer! Baby killer! Baby killer! You bastards are gonna burn in hell! Abortion is murder! It's a child, not a choice! Pro-choice is pro-death! Wow! Great rhetoric.
 Thank you.
 Hey, you're really hard-core, aren't you? Oh, well, you know. I mean, if you really wanna see hard-core
 What's this?
 That's the list of doctors I'm gonna kill.
 There's two already crossed out.
 Yeah, I know.
 So you really had a good time, huh?
 Yeah. We had a blast.
 Hmm. He didn't give you any problems?
 No. Not a single problem. Uh, listen, I was thinking maybe I could take him out this Saturday?
 Really?
 Yeah, sure. I'd pick him up at, like, 8:00? You know, do the father-son thing. Are you all right? Is that gonna be okay? Because I could really use use him.
 Goddamn it!
 I'm sorry. Is everything all right? I can't do this! Tommy's not your son.
 What?
 RememberJimmy Doyle from high school? That son of a bitch is Tommy's real father. He left me six months ago.
 You know what a nightmare it's been since he left?
 I don't care.
 I can't raise Tommy alone.
 I don't care! You thought you'd just pawn your son off on me? What else? I thought I could find him a better role model than that piece of shit! Stop talking! Wait. Let me think. God! All right. So can I still take him out on Saturday?
 Yeah.
 Great.
 That's pretty thin. That might be too thin.
 Hey-oh!
 Hey, Mac. Where you been?
 Oh, I don't know. Saving humanity.
 Are you still on this kick, dude?
 Yeah, you know, Den I was thinking what you were saying the other day about the T-shirts with the stupid slogans on them. And I was wondering what you think about this? Huh, bitch? Yeah! Is that stupid enough for you? You're not seriously wearing that, are you? You look ridiculous.
 Whatever, dude.
 You know, that's the problem with you antiabortionists. You cry about the sanctity of life, and then you wear a shirt like that.
 I'm not listening to you.
 Aren't you right-wingers all about the death penalty too?
 Does that not involve killing somebody?
 Right, right, right. And you liberals are against killing murderers. But you're for killing innocent babies. That's interesting.
 Yeah. We like to kill babies.
 You guys are taking this way too seriously. Den, you don't understand the week I've been having. I met a girl at one of these organizations who is a freak. She is the dirtiest chick I've met in my life.
 Seriously?
 Yeah. You gotta come with me to one of these rallies. They're having another one on Saturday. These chicks are everywhere.
 I can jump on board with that.
 Yeah! Are you actually gonna throw away all your convictions for a chance to get laid? I don't really have any convictions. Where is this rally being held? Uh, Planned Parenthood, Bryn Mawr Medical Center. Well, I'm gonna go. At least one pro-choice voice is gonna be heard. One? There was, like, tons of those chicks at the last one.
 Which side had more?
 Oh, which one do you think? The one that cares about protecting women's bodies or the one that's run by the religious right? Probably the side you're goin' to. I'm gonna fight for the right to choose. You're a scumbag, Dennis.
 Today's a big day for me, Tommy.
 Why? Well, today is probably the best chance I'm ever gonna have of hooking up with this girl. So, uh, look at me for a second, pal. Okay, do me a favor. If you're good today, I'm gonna buy you anything that you want, anything in the world, all right? Oh, my God! I will smash your face into a into a jelly! Wrong key. Keep abortion legal! Keep abortion legal! Stop abortion now! Stop abortion now! This is crazy. Yeah, weird. People actually care about women's bodies. You believe that? Yeah. I think Mac picked the wrong side.
 There's, like, no dudes here.
 Gross. You know what? Uh, give me a second here.
 Hi.
 Hi.
 I like your look.
 Excuse me? I like the whole hippie thing. It really works for you.
 Get lost, breeder.
 Oh, okay. Yeah. Mmm.
 I love the smell of protest in the morning.
 What? I was quoting that movie, you know, Apocalypse Now. "Napalm in the morning."
 Is that the new Mel Gibson movie?
 No. Did you see Passion of the Christ? I saw it 12 times. Okay. You know, you really shouldn't joke about the Apocalypse. So just fill these out. We'll get your information in the mail. Thanks. "Keep your laws" I like your T-shirt.
 Thanks.
 Yeah. Where do I sign?
 Right here.
 Love T-shirts like that. Right. So, do you come to these kind of things often, or Are you hitting on me at an abortion rally? Yeah, I You know what? I think all these chicks are gay. Yeah, I don't know that they're gay. I think they can just smell how disgusting you are. That sucks for me. Hello. Hey, Mac. It's Dennis. Uh, look, man, there's no talent over here. What's the deal over there? Oh, yeah. We're lookin' real good over here, bro.
 What do you think?
 Hop the fence and come over. All right. I'll see you in a second. Later, gator. All right, Megan. I'm finished. You are a genius. Hey, Sis. I'm gonna jet.
 You're leaving?
 Uh, this side sucks. I'm gonna try my luck over there.
 Are you kidding me?
 Later, tater. Dennis, you are such a jackass! Excuse me. Excuse me. Yeah. Can I get by here? Thanks. I just I really love that sign. I wondered that so many times. Hey, there's a guy on the fence. Hey! Hey! They're coming after us!
 No. They're not coming after us.
 I'll show you what we do to them. How's your aim? Pretty good. But I don't think that's such a good idea.
 I don't think
 Hey, it's okay. These people deserve this. Yeah. He looks like he deserves it. Maybe just one. Oh! Ow! Yeah! Come on! Get your eggs, people!
 Oh, my God!
 Ow!
 Shit! They're throwing eggs!
 They did this last time. I came prepared. Oh. Hey, Dennis! How's the action over there, buddy?
 What? What the hell are you doing?
 Oh! They're coming
 Now they're coming back.
 Die!
 Hey!
 Hot chicks on that side, Dennis? You're gonna burn in hell! Stop! Stop! Stop! Hey, guess what. I have a surprise for you.
 What?
 It's a real miracle.
 What is it?
 I'm pregnant! What? I'm pregnant! You gotta get an abortion.
 Megan, wait, wait, wait!
 Stop talking to me! Well, listen, I just think our situation is different.
 How is our situation different?
 Well, because I didn't mean to get you pregnant.
 It was an accident.
 You are so pathetic. You can't have this kid. I'm way too young, and I have a little bit of an alcohol problem
 Save it! I'm not pregnant!
 What? I'm not pregnant. It was a test. I just thought for, like, one second that you might be the one. I just had to know for sure. Wait a second! So you're not pregnant?
 No.
 And this was a test?
 Yeah.
 And I failed? Have a nice life, asshole. No! Wait Wait Wait a second! Wait! Oh. Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch!
 Where the hell have you been? You said 11:30, dude!
 I don't wanna talk about it. That waitress is picking me up any minute! I was ready to shut down the bar!
 What is that kid doin' here?
 I'm taking him to the Big Brother-Big Sister thing.
 Get him out of here, Charlie.
 I'm getting picked up any minute! Will you relax?
 I told you, I don't want kids in the bar!
 Dude, what is up your ass?
 You You are out! Whoa, dude! This kid reeks of booze! No, no, no, no, no. Are you drunk? Don't be drunk.
 Yeah.
 How could you let this happen? I was the only one bartending! He must have been takin' sips out of people's beers.
 All right. Brew some coffee.
 You can't give him coffee!
 Let go of that! Let go of that!
 Get him out of here, Charlie! Charlie! Okay, here we go! Fresh air! Have a seat! Sit down! Fresh air!
 You suck!
 You suck, all right? Breathe it in. Fresh air now.
 You suck and you have an ugly face!
 You suck! You have an ugly face, okay? You try and push people's buttons all the time! And you get in their head, and you drive them crazy!
 Maybe that's why you don't have a dad anymore!
 Oh, my God!
 What are you doing?
 I'm drunk.
 He's drunk?
 He's not drunk.
 I am drunk!
 You're not drunk.
 He sounds drunk.
 I am drunk! You're not drunk! Stop saying that! He's fine.
 Jimmy Doyle!
 Yeah?
 Charlie Kelly.
 Yeah?
 From high school.
 Oh, yeah. I didn't recognize you without all your acne. Yeah.
 All right, listen, I need to talk to you about your kid.
 Why?
 Uh, let's see. Because your kid has serious emotional problems.
 Why?
 I don't know. Maybe because you're not there as a father.
 Why?
 You're kidding me? This your little game?
 Why?
 This is what you're doin'? This is what you're doin' to me?
 Why? Why?                       I like what I'm seeing here!
 I like what you're doing right now!
 I like what you're doing!
 I like what you're doing!
 I like what we're all doing!
 I like this guy!
 This is insane!
 I know!
 This is good! This is a good scene!
 I've never seen so many beautiful people in my life!
 Hey, check it out! Even Sweet Dee's getting lucky! That dude's gonna bang your sister, bro.
 This is good, man. I feel good.
 You look good, brother. No, no, no, no. I feel better than good.
 You know, I feel like, um I feel like dancing.
 Whoa, it feels good, man!
 You should.
 I feel like dancing!
 Get out there, buddy. Make it happen. Nice.
 I feel like dancing! I love that little man. This is great. I mean, what's going on?
 This is, like, the greatest night Paddy's has ever seen.
 I know!
 Kind of a young crowd, right?
 Yeah!
 Really, really young.
 Mm-hmm. What, do you think these kids are in college or what? I don't know. Hey. You. How old are you? Twenty-one? Everybody, out! But I don't understand how you guys could let this happen. It was not my fault. I was working behind the bar. Come on, Dennis. You remember what it was like in high school. The minute we caught word that a bar wasn't carding we would just pack the place the following weekend. They probably had a recon crew come in last week.
 They definitely had
 Why, you guys? Why were we not carding?
 Not my job.
 Not my job either. It's all of our jobs. We could get into a lot of trouble for this. And we also have a social responsibility to keep teenagers from drinking. I guess.
 I don't know about that though.
 Oh, Mac!
 Mac, don't.
 Hold on a second. Hear me out. It wasn't that long ago that we were in the same position as these youngsters, right? I mean, we'd get kicked out of some bar, and what did we do, Den? We would get a bunch of 40s from a homeless guy and we'd go sit in some park, right?
 That is true. That is absolutely true.
 And what would happen? We would almost get raped and/or murdered and/or stabbed by crackheads in Fairmount Park. You wanna know what else what would happen? We drove Nicky Potnik's car into a tree on Kelly Drive. With Sweet Dee in the backseat puking because some guy talked to her that she liked, remember? Every time some guy talks to you that you like you get so nervous you drink yourself into oblivion.
 I had bad potato salad.
 You drink yourself crazy. You abused alcohol, and that's okay. But it's very dangerous, right? Right? Okay. Well, maybe we should look at this whole thing from a different angle. Maybe we have "a social responsibility" to provide a safe haven for these kids to be kids.
 You know, experiment.
 No. I don't like where this is heading.
 We would have to set up ground rules.
 Okay. No drinking and driving. No one's gonna crash Nicky Potnik's car.
 Right.
 Everyone has to take a cab. Four drink maximum. Like, that's it. You know what I mean? Yeah, yeah. That's it. Anyone causing trouble can't come.
 If you're gonna be here, you gotta be cool.
 He's gone! He's gone! Listen, we water down the drinks, jack up the prices.
 Oh, my Come on!
 We could make a serious profit off these kids. And they'd have no idea what the hell's going on.
 We would actually be doing something good.
 Great. I say we do it.
 Yeah.
 I don't know how you guys live with yourselves.
 One day at a time.
 One day at a time. Yeah, I know, Mom. I heard you the first time. I'm perfectly aware of what time it is. Thank you, Mom. Do we have to do this right now? Yeah, I know how old I am. Did you think that I forgot, maybe, how old That's As a matter of fact, I have a date this afternoon with my friend Steven. So I should probably go, 'cause I gotta get ready for that. Mm-hmm. All right. Yeah, you too. Bye. Hello, Steven. Hello.
 Dee?
 Yeah.
 This is Trey from last night.
 Oh, hey, Trey. You know what? I don't think I should be talking with you. I think you're the most beautiful woman I've ever met in my entire life. Really? I can't believe that someone as gorgeous as you can be so down to earth. Well, you know, I've always tried to keep both feet on the ground, so Yeah. So, listen, I have a lacrosse game but I was wondering if you wanted to meet me and my friends at Lemon Hill afterwards. Lemon Hill? That's where all the cool kids used to go.
 Good. So you've been there.
 Oh! Come on. I've been there, like, 200 times. Why don't you stop by? I mean, unless you got something better to do today. Wow. You can really put 'em back, can't you? The trick is to just kind of open your throat. You are so much cooler than all the other girls I know. You are so sweet. Can you get me another one of these? Whoo!
 All right. There you go.
 Look how much fun they're having, man. Of course they are. They haven't realized how much life sucks yet. Remember how great high school was? All those parties, no responsibilities.
 High school was the best.
 Do you guys even remember high school?
 I don't think it happened the way you think.
 What do you mean? The only reason you got to hang out with me and the other cool kids is 'cause you sold us all weed.
 Everybody thought you were an asshole.
 I was popular! Mac was very popular. And I like to think I was pretty popular myself.
 You were.
 No, he was. You were popular like a clown is popular.
 What?
 Yeah, you made us all laugh. All the guys knew you couldn't sleep with their girlfriends. Whatever, dude. The only reason you got laid is 'cause you dated freshmen. Yeah. You've always had that creepy thing with younger girls.
 I do not.
 You're not in high school anymore, pal. You better keep it in the pants, 'cause it's kind of creepy. You want to talk about creepy? You guys sniffing glue in your mom's basement. That's creepy. Tim Murphy slept with your prom date. Tim Murphy slept with your prom date!
 Tim Murphy had sex with your prom date!
 That's right.
 Oh. He's getting sad now.
 Oh, no.
 There's, like, watering in the eyes.
 Now he's running away. Oh, is he gonna cry? Did you see that? He was totally gonna cry. Oh, Trey, that is so sad. It was a really bad breakup. I mean, Tammy's great and all. I just wasn't feeling it, you know? Oh, yeah. Well, you gotta feel it. Don't get me wrong. Tammy's, like, the prettiest girl in school so it was a perfect match.
 It just wasn't working.
 Hmm. She's not as pretty as you though. Oh! Thank you. Wait! I can't do this.
 What?
 I never statutory raped anyone before. Oh. Okay. I'll tell you what. Let's, uh, just take it slow. You are so sweet. Where were you when I was in high school? I was eight. Right. Yeah. These kids are wasted, bro. I thought we were cuttin' 'em off. I am cuttin' 'em off. These kids haven't had more than three drinks each. Plus, there's so much water, they're probably more hydrated than they ever have been.
 Are they fakin' it?
 I guess.
 Just stay away from me, Billy!
 No, Sara! I saw you flirting with him! No, I know it. You were throwing yourself on him! Hey, hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Give me some eyes! Look at me! Cool your jets!
 I'm sorry.
 All right, beat it!
 Are you okay?
 He's such a player.
 Is he a player?
 Big time. I hate players. All right. I'm sorry. I'm getting fired up here. Charlie, that was the coolest thing you've ever done! I know. I'm gonna be sick.
 Oh, shit.
 You Dennis Reynolds?
 Yeah.
 You like what you see? Uh, I don't know. Dude, relax. I'm 18.
 Are you in high school?
 Yes.
 Then take a hike.
 Doesn't seem to bother your sister. What? She was all over this one boy in my class today. Really? Listen, dude, I'm legal and I love to party. So if you're looking for the ride of your life give me a call. Goddamn it. Hang on. I'm coming!
 What the hell is wrong with you?
 What? I know you were hanging out with that high school kid from the bar. Okay. You know what? We're just friends, all right? He went through a really bad breakup, and he just needed me to be there for him. What you're doing is sick and wrong. Are you living out some sad fantasy of yours?
 Going out with the most popular kid in high school.
 Why would that be a fantasy? I went out with tons of guys in high school. You wore that scoliosis back brace until you were 20 years old.
 Everyone was afraid of you.
 No, they weren't.
 You looked like a monster! Do you all have amnesia?
 What is that supposed to mean? Oh, my God. You're as delusional as Mac and Charlie. Do not compare me to Mac and Charlie. I'm telling you, this is the wrong kind of glue, Charlie.
 No, it's not.
 This is made for, like, kindergartners or something.
 No, this will work.
 No, look. "Nontoxic and safe." We don't want safe. We want toxic.
 Something's happening.
 Nothing is gonna happen.
 Something's happening.
 Nothing's gonna happen. No, you're right. This isn't working. Y'ello. Yeah. Oh, hey. How are you? Really? That's cool. Yeah. Okay. Bye. Dude. That was that girl Sara, the one from the bar the other night who I rescued from that kid. Well, her parents are out of town, and she's totally having a party. What do you think? Kind of a lame party, bro. Uh, what do you think? Should we jet? Yeah. This doesn't feel right. Hey, guys!
 Hi, Sara.
 Hey. I'm so glad you guys came. Well, uh, we ran into a little bit of a problem. My brother, he was supposed to pick up the keg, but he bailed on me.
 Oh, that sucks.
 Yeah. Yeah, it totally sucks. So, um, we were wondering if maybe you guys could help us out.
 Oh, you mean No, I don't
 Ooh, no. Geez, I don't think that's such a good idea. Listen, it's one thing at the bar, you know, where we have control over you guys.
 It's another thing
 Ah, come on, please? Please.
 You guys have been so cool.
 Yeah, we were just talking about how cool you guys were.
 Really?
 You were? Mm-hmm. This would be the coolest thing that anyone's ever done for us.
 Ever.
 Ever. Who wants to do a keg stand? Um, I'm kind ofhaving second thoughts a little bit. Oh, come on. It'll be a blast. Yeah, well, I don't think your friends like me that much. Let's go get a beer. Twenty-five, 26
 Hey, Dee.
 Hi, guys.
 What's going on?
 Just hanging out, you know? Yeah. Wanna do a keg stand? Seventy-five, 76, 77!
 Seventy-seven seconds! That is a new record, baby!
 I did it. I did it. So, Ben is, like, "I don't care what Kevin said, Sara. I was only going out with Rachel to get closer to you." Oh, my Oh, my God. What did you say to that? "Whatever, Ben. I heard from Caitlin that you were totally into her." Um, he's so full of shit. Goddamn! Come on. Oh, come on. Yeah! What do you think about that, bitches? Load 'em up, losers! What do you think about this, huh? How I embarrassed your boyfriend in front of everybody? You like that?
 You like what you see?
 What's with this guy? I know. What is he, like, 40? Get me some more! Get me some more! Let's go! Load 'em up!
 I'm gonna put on a goddamn clinic!
 What an asshole. Come on, guys. Hey. Let's go. Let's go!
 Oh, get off me, dude!
 Get off me! Can we please get out of here? Let's go. Why? Trey asked me to prom last night. This is getting really weird.
 That girl Sara asked me too.
 You're kidding! What? No, we can't go to the prom. That's pathetic. What do you mean "we"? Who asked you? Let's just go. Let's just go. All right, all right. I'm coming.
 Hi, sexy.
 What are you doing here? You gotta get out of here. I need a date for the prom, and I want you to take me. Are you kidding me? I can't do that, okay?
 You gotta go.
 Isn't there anything I can do to change your mind? No. No, no, no. No. Leave. Leave. Go. Okay. You can either take me to the prom or I can tell the police that you're serving underage kids.
 Are you serious?
 Try me. Goddamn it. You know what? I don't think we should be serving minors anymore.
 Oh, no. Somebody's jealous.
 I'm not jealous. I just think it's dangerous.
 You're jealous you didn't get asked to the prom.
 I don't care about that.
 Ah, you're gonna cry?
 Shut up! Yo, you guys? No more kids in the bar, seriously.
 Okay! Now we're talking some sense.
 What the hell?
 This girl asked me to the prom.
 What? Yeah. This girl comes over to my house tells me that if I don't go to the prom with her, she's gonna rat us out to the cops. Wait a second. Hold on. So all of you guys got asked to the prom? You guys got asked to the prom?
 Yeah.
 Whoa. Oh, this is so lame! At least you don't actually have to go.
 Are you going?
 Yeah. I have to. Oh, well, if you're going, I'm going then, I guess.
 So you
 What? I didn't get to go when I was in high school. It might actually be fun. If you guys are going, I'm going. I'm not staying here.
 Are you gonna go?
 I'm gonna go.
 I have to go, so
 You guys are pathetic! Maybe if you weren't such a jerk, someone might have asked you. Because Sara told me that Maureen told her that Regina McGinley thought you were cute.
 Then Ray Rafferty comes up to you at the party, and you're
 Charlie, shut up! The only reason that Sara asked you in the first place is because you're the only idiot dumb enough to listen to her bitch about her ex-boyfriend all night! Whatever. Hey, we should have a pre-prom party. You know what, Charlie? I think this is actually gonna be pretty great. Oh, dude, are you kidding me? This is gonna be awesome.
 I can't wait to just get out there and start dancing.
 I'm gonna dance too.
 Are you gonna dance, baby? You gonna dance with me?
 I'm gonna dance like this. Oh, Dee! Come here. Let me take a look at you. Wow. You look You look Yeah. I know. I feel so lucky that this thing even fits still.
 Is that your dress from high school?
 Yup.
 You didn't go to the prom in high school, Dee.
 No, I know. My back brace was under the dress, and Mom called me fat. So I stayed home and cried instead. Take Take it slow. Take it slow. I know, you guys, but I just am so nervous. I just want this whole night to be so special. That dude is going to bang your sister, bro.
 What's up, bitches? Mmm!
 What is this? What are you doing? You assholes aren't gonna be the only ones having fun. I'm going to the prom.
 Dork! You cannot crash a high school prom.
 I'm going stag, bro. Mac, you are so pathetic. Yes, and your eyebrows are drawn on, so Whoa. Well, you know what? How 'bout this? Say it, don't spray it. Trey's here. Oh, my God. Hello. Excuse me, Mac. My date has arrived. Trey is so cool. He's totally gonna bang your sister. Hello, sweet prince. Wow! You look good. I know! Like a princess.
 Can I tell you a little secret?
 Sure. Beat it.
 I always wanted to have sex on prom.
 Ah. All right. So what's the plan? Do we have a limo or what?
 The plan is, you're not coming with us.
 Yeah.
 Why not?
 You weren't invited and you don't have a date.
 You totally suck.
 I totally suck?
 What is that supposed to mean?
 Oh, Jesus. Oh, who is that?
 That's my prom date.
 Mm-hmm. She's unbelievable. How old is she?
 She's 18.
 Eighteen?
 You are a lucky man. You are a lucky man.
 Oh, you dick! Wait a second. You guys called me creepy for liking young chicks. Eighteen's legal, bro. This isn't a morality contest. Eighteen's not young, brother.
 So you guys are giving me the go-ahead? I mean, can I
 Go ahead.
 Hi, Dennis.
 Hi.
 You look
 Yeah, I know.
 Do ya?
 Mm-hmm.
 I can't zip it up. Your hair's all caught.
 All right. Just pull it. Oh.
 Tammy?
 Mm-mmm. No. What? Hold on one minute.
 Can I get you a drink?
 Maybe.
 What would you like?
 Anything you want.
 Tammy, what are you doing here?
 I'm picking up my date. You're going to prom with this guy? Yes. Can I talk to you for a second? What the hell is going on? That's Tammy, Trey's ex-girlfriend. This is classic Tammy. Trey broke up with Tammy because Maureen Kinallen said that she saw Tammy flirting with Walt Timby at a party. But she was only doing it to make Trey jealous because, you know she thought that Trey secretly liked Erin Hannabry. But Trey didn't like Erin Hannabry. It was all a bunch of bull.
 What is happening?
 That's Tammy, Trey's ex-girlfriend. This is classic Tammy. Trey broke up with Tammy Charlie, you gotta stop, honestly.
 What are they talking about?
 Whoa!
 Where are they going?
 What the hell is this? Oh, man! Ah, they did it. They got what they wanted.
 This is bullshit.
 So wait a second. They were actually using you two to make each other jealous. I always knew that they'd wind up together, 'cause they're, like, so perfect for each other.
 Shut up, Charlie!
 They're one of those perfect matches.
 That dude's gonna bang your prom date, bro.
 Stop saying it!
 It's not funny!
 Hey, why are you such an asshole all the time? I'm not the asshole. You guys are the ones that just got dumped on prom night.
 You got dumped on prom night!
 You were gonna go stag.
 Yes, I was. Absolutely.
 How old are you, dude?
 I am 28 years old.
 You're a piece of crap!
 I'm not a piece of crap! You're a piece of crap.
 I have to pee. Stop it. Go pee. I hate you, Charlie. Just like high school.                     Yo, Charlie! It's Dennis!
 Hey.
 Hey, dude. What's up, buddy? Hey, your face looks, uh, like, poofy. Uh Uh, yeah, I've been cryin' a little bit. Huh? I'm sorry. Hey, do you have that basketball? Mac and I were about to go play in the park. I think you
 Uh, yeah. I might. Come on in.
 Yeah? Okay. Wow, dude! I thought my place looked like shit. Oh. Yeah. What's wrong? You look, uh, hungover or something. No. Yeah, it's I found out I might have cancer, so ooh.
 What?
 Yeah, I found out I might have cancer. That's why I haven't been down to the bar recently. And, uh Jesus, dude. I don't know what to say. You don't have to say anything. Here, check these pamphlets out. They go over cancer, cancer-related issues. You know, it feels actually pretty good to get this off my chest, you know?
 Yeah?
 I've been sittin' in here boohooin' a little bit. So, uh I mean, I'm glad we can talk. We can talk, right?
 Yeah. Of course. Yeah, talk. We can always talk.
 Awesome, dude. All right, so it starts out I'm not feeling good. I'm havin' headaches and Uh, did you want to talk, like, right now? Well, you know, I was thinking we could talk right now. Well, it's not really a good time. It's just that Mac and Sweet Dee are down in the car waitin' for me. I told them I'd just, you know, zip in and zip out.
 Oh, yeah. All right.
 I could ask 'em to wait. Don't do that.
 I really shouldn't.
 Then don't. Hey, uh, look, man.
 Keep Keep your head up. You're gonna get through this.
 Oh, yeah.
 Yeah.
 Do me a favor though. Uh, don't tell anybody.
 I don't want it gettin' around.
 Oh, no, no. I won't say anything. Thanks. All right. Uh Uh Could I get the the basketball though? It's just we're supposed to meet, like, a bunch of people
 and we were supposed to bring that.
 Yeah, no. You're Okay. Yeah, but Charlie's got such great hair. Is he gonna lose all of his hair? Yeah. He probably is.
 Well, so what kind of cancer is it?
 I don't know, man.
 Well, when does he go in for treatment?
 He didn't say. You know, we just stood there for a long time and didn't say much, you know? And we cried together, and I held him for a while and that was it. Mm-hmm. That is so sad. He is gonna look so bad without that hair.
 We gotta do somethin' nice for him. We should go back.
 No, no, no. We can't go back. He made me promise not to tell anybody. So when we see him we're supposed to act like we don't know anything?
 Yeah.
 No, no. That's not right at all. We can't just abandon him right now. He needs people around him. He shouldn't be alone. I learned a lot in my theater and psych classes about the human nature Whoa, whoa, whoa. Dee, you know what? Nobody cares about your psych or theater training. No, no, no. Dee's right. Let's think about this. What's the one thing that Charlie never gets?
 Laid.
 Right! So let's find a girl for Charlie.
 No, not at all what I was saying actually.
 No, no. Let's find Let's find a girl for Charlie someone to be there for him
 spend time with him, you know, nurture him.
 Bang him.
 Have sex with him, right.
 Okay, great.
 You have any friends desperate enough?
 Are you out of your mind?
 I'm not helping you with this.
 Oh, come on.
 Don't be a pain in the ass.
 I am not be Speaking of which, anybody want to get up off their ass and help me with the boxes?
 The boxes? That's what Charlie does.
 Charlie's job, yeah.
 Yeah. Well, I can't do it all by myself.
 Oh, I'm sorry. So Charlie's wasting away, and we're gonna talk about Sweet Dee's feelings all morning.
 Great.
 Okay, you know what? I love Charlie very much. But this is a stupid idea you guys have. So you know what?
 Oh! Whatever!
 I am not helping you with it.
 Whatever. You know what, Dennis? We don't need her.
 You're right. We don't need her. What we'll do is we'll find a girl for Charlie tonight in the bar.
 Yes.
 No, you won't.
 Yes, we will.
 There are never any girls in this bar. Goddamn it!
 I told you.
 I don't get it, Dee. There are tons of women in this city. Where do they go?
 Uh, they're at the velvet-rope clubs on Delaware Avenue.
 Why? Dennis, our bar is in South Philly in a scary alley.
 Might as well call it Rape Bar.
 No, no, no. The problem is that every time a beautiful girl comes into a place like this it's always the biggest asshole that winds up accosting her. Carmen, you have the most amazing body. Are you bulimic, or what? No. I work out, like, every day.
 Yeah, it shows.
 You look like you work out too. Yeah. One would think actually. But it's pretty much all natural. Dennis, maybe you need to rethink this whole plan of yours. I don't think getting Charlie laid is gonna help his cancer problem.
 Whatever.
 Dennis, I found the perfect girl for Charlie.
 Smart, beautiful, the whole thing.
 Where?
 Right there.
 Over by the pool table?
 Yeah. Nice.
 That's great, Mac.
 Good work, Mac.
 That's a dude. No. The one with the exposed midriff and the cans. Yeah. That's Eric Wyzotski's cousin. Carmen, right?
 Yeah.
 Yeah, Carmen.
 Tranny.
 Implants?
 Yeah.
 Nice.
 Not bad. It's good.
 Are you sure? Yeah. Look at his jeans, dude. There's an unmistakable bulge of a large penis in those jeans.
 There's a dick in those pants.
 There's a dick in those pants.
 Yeah.
 I'll be right back. Excuse me, bro. Can you give me a second?
 Thanks. Is that a penis in your pants?
 Yeah.
 You lied to me.
 No, I didn't. You lied to me. You don't work out? Please. I've seen you at the gym. You're ripped. No. Don't turn this around. Wait. Really? You think so?
 Yeah.
 I was afraid I was getting a little too ripped, you know? Oh, no. I like it. Wow! Hmm. Well, I gotta get back to work. Um, but I don't know. Maybe I'll give you a call sometime.
 Okay.
 Yeah. Yeah, I'll give you a call. What do you want, Charlie?
 I like your bracelet.
 Great. That's one of those, uh, Lance Armstrong "Race for the Cure" "Live Strong" kind of things.
 Yeah.
 Cool. That's very cool.
 You must be a very compassionate person.
 I'm not.
 Uh
 Did you want something from me, or What time are are you getting off of work? It's not a thing to walk away about. Whatever. Dennis, I don't have time to talk to you about this. But we found the perfect girl for Charlie.
 That's awesome.
 Okay, you know the waitress over at the coffee shop
 the one that he's been in love with forever?
 Yes. Well, okay. He saw her wearing one of those Lance Armstrong "Race for the Cure" "I Love People that are Dying of Cancer" type bracelets.
 That's really cool.
 Well, so that bracelet probably means that she's compassionate towards sick and dying people. You know what I mean? That's what that symbolizes. You know what that symbolizes? Those bracelets symbolize jumping on fashion trends. And you know what the thing that's so rad is? They come in all kinds of colors now, so you can accessorize your compassion with your outfits.
 Really cool.
 All right. All right. Well, be that as it may, we still need you to talk to her because the whole thing is gonna sound so much better coming from a girl. First of all, I don't have time since, apparently I'm the only one who does anything around here anymore.
 And second of all, it's gross!
 I'm sure that there's something Mac and I can do for you that will convince you to help us. Sweet Dee is in. Sweet Dee's in what? She is in way over her head.
 In what?
 Debt. Huh. I know that game. I'm gonna get a beer. You want one? Great. Uh, yeah.
 Nice cover, dick.
 Thanks.
 So Sweet Dee's in?
 Yeah. Uh, under one condition.
 What?
 She gets to punch you in the face.
 What?
 Right in the face.
 Why?
 The Christmas party. How about that game against Dallas when Santa came out at halftime and we threw batteries? She grabbed me from behind. It was instinctual. I know that, man. You don't grab.
 You don't grab from behind.
 Not from behind. That sucks because if Sweet Dee's out, we need to find another girl quickly. Uh, well We, uh, you know We kind of need her. We kind of need Sweet Dee. You're sayin' Are you talking about letting Sweet Dee punch me in my face? Charlie has cancer. "So you're new here, yeah? Who are you?" Who am I? I'm just a small-town girl who moved to the big city with big dreams just to find out the only way to make it in the big city is to shake it. And that's what I do at the Coyote Ugly. End scene. Wow. Artemis, that was amazing. Wow! That really means a lot. But you won't be seeing me in class anymore. I lost my job at the Wawa. I'm sorry. Are you doing another scene? L I I won't be able to pay my bills! I'm thinkin' about goin' on welfare! What am I gonna do?
 Oh, my God! Ow.
 Okay.
 Hello?
 Hey, Dennis. It's Dee. I was What are you listening to? Uh, Rick Astley. What's up? Oh, nothing. Only I just solved all of our problems.
 Really?
 Mm-hmm. Except for Charlie and the whole cancer thing. But I did figure out how to get help at the bar.
 Sweet Dee, we talked about this.
 No, no. Just listen. I was thinking we could do that whole Coyote Ugly theme. You know, where the girls dance on top of the bars
 take their bras off and stuff.
 I'm listening. Okay, well, I have a friend who would be absolutely perfect for it. She'd work for tips only. And she would even come in and interview with you, so you could see if you liked her. Would she wear the, uh, hot pants, tank top, wanna-hump-hump pumps?
 Oh, yeah.
 Do it. Okay. Only under one condition. I don't wanna help you get that waitress to sleep with Charlie. Oh, come on, Sis. We need you. Okay, you know what? You gotta choose. Charlie's waitress or a hot new bartender?
 Sweet Dee's out.
 What? Yeah. She's too busy training this new bartender. Apparently, she's got this hot new friend who sh-she
 Hey.
 Hey.
 Hi.
 Carmen.
 Dennis.
 That's a three-pointer. What are you guys, uh What are you doin'? Just watchin' a basketball game. Oh. I was just leaving actually. Oh, oh, no, no, no. You know what? I was gonna leave. I mean, you you you could No, it's okay. I've got a hair appointment in, like, 20 minutes.
 It was nice to see you.
 It was good to see you.
 So I'll see you tonight?
 Oh. Mm-hmm.
 I'll pick you up at 8:00?
 Cool. Okay.
 She's gettin' it removed.
 So what? I'm just puttin' in my time, you know?
 So that afterwards I'll be
 Gross, dude. First. Gross.
 This is just pathetic.
 Yeah.
 All right. Let's roll.
 W-Wait. Well Well, what's the plan? The plan is that you're gonna distract Charlie, okay? I'm gonna march up to that waitress, tell her that he has cancer. All right? She's gonna feel sorry for him, and then she's gonna sleep with him. That's not gonna work. You can't just do that. Well, what do you wanna do?
 Hey, Dennis.
 Charlie has cancer. Really?
 Yeah.
 That's so sad. Yeah. Are you okay?
 Yeah. I'm I'm all right.
 Yeah?
 You did what?
 I slept with her. Charlie's been in love with that girl for months. I know, man. I don't know what happened. I mentioned the cancer thing.
 She instantly started comin' on to me.
 Really? Yeah. You were right about that. Cancer gold mine.
 What What are we gonna do?
 Don't worry. I got a plan. Bam. Bam? What's that? $200.
 Why?
 Well, Dennis was thinking that that might help convince you to sleep with our friend Charlie. Gross.
 250.
 Deal. Hey, Carmen! Hey, yo, Carmen!
 Hey.
 Charlie has cancer. Oh, my God! You poor baby. I'll be right down. Hey, Dennis! Could you help me with this keg, please? Uh, I slept a little funny on my neck. Hey, is your friend gonna be doin' stuff like this?
 Um
 Hello.
 Can I help you?
 I'm Artemis.
 Okay.
 I'm here for the audition. I'm just a small-town girl who moved to the big city with big dreams just to find out the only way to make it in the big city is to shake it. That's what I do. Shake it. Shake it. You wanna see me shake it? Of course you do. They all do. I shake it. Shake it. I shake it. I shake it. I shake it. I sha You cannot possibly have thought that this was gonna be a good idea. Oh, you know what? This is so you. I tell you I need some help behind the bar. I finally find someone who's perfect, and she'll practically work for free. And just 'cause she doesn't have the right measurements or whatever, you freak out. Oh, you just want somebody to do all the grunt work for you.
 Shh! She's gonna hear you.
 I don't care! Hey-oh! What's goin' on? Gotta pee.
 Hey, buddy?
 Dennis!
 What's goin' on, man? You seem really happy.
 Uh, I feel pretty happy.
 Do you? What happened?
 I think you know what happened. Uh, I might.
 Yeah. I think you do know. You talked to that waitress, right?
 Yeah. It totally worked. It totally I don't know what you said, but we went out on this date.
 She really likes me. So thank you, man.
 You're welcome, man!
 Yeah, you seem flush. You seem like a
 I feel like a I feel like an ice cream sundae, you know? That's great, man. That is terrific. It must really take your mind off things then, huh? Sure, yeah. What things? Well, you know, the cancer. Here's the thing though about cancer. I don't have it. What? Mom, I'm telling you, this girl's amazing. Yeah, I got butterflies in my stomach. There's one little issue. Yeah. Oh! Oh, my God! I think you broke my nose!
 That guy's beatin' on that chick!
 Oh, my God! Oh, no. You know what? It's a dude. Yeah, she has a penis. So it's okay.
 Dude, isn't that a hate crime?
 Shit, yeah, it's a hate crime!
 How could you do this?
 Oh, well, excuse me for bein'
 the most terrible man on the planet!
 L I'm sorry.
 Oh, I'm a terrible man!
 What are you doing? What is that?
 We thought you were dying, Charlie.
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
 Who's we?
 Me and Mac and Sweet Dee. Oh, great! Great. I told you not to tell anyone! Now I'm gonna have to go into remission or something so they don't think I was lying.
 You were lying!
 Yeah. I lied to you, all right? Look. The girl she wears a Lance Armstrong bracelet. Okay? So I tell you that I have cancer, right? Then you're gonna tell her. She's gonna feel sorry for me. We're gonna start dating. And that's the way that life works, man!
 That was a horrible thing to do!
 Well, I'm a bad guy then.
 You are a bad guy! You lied to us.
 All right, look at this. Sometimes you gotta crack a few eggs to make an omelet.
 You gotta crack a couple eggs to make an omelet?
 You gotta crack an egg.
 So you're throwing down life lessons now?
 I'm throwin' down eggs! Class is in session. The teacher's teachin' class now!
 I'm crackin' eggs of wisdom.
 Is that what you're doin'?
 Let me crack one more egg for you and throw it in the omelet!
 You got an egg?
 The waitress doesn't even like you.
 Yeah?
 We had to pay her $250 to have sex with you!
 Aha! Because Sex? We didn't have sex. Hey! Guess what, Dee. You're gonna love this. No, no, no. Give me a second. Charlie was lying the whole time.
 He doesn't have cancer.
 Well, how could you not tell me
 that you paid her to have sex with me?
 What? I don't understand how you could possibly be so You can't lie about having cancer! It's not something you do!
 We thought you were dying!
 Guys, guys, guys, listen! You're never gonna believe what happened! I accidentally punched that tranny in the face. These two guys started chasing me. Dee, get me a beer. It was unbelievable. I ran all the way here. Go.
 Hey.
 Hey. Hey, what the hell do you guys want?
 Well, it's funny. It's a, uh It's a funny, funny thing.
 It's funny. Uh, we paid you $250 to sleep with Charlie and And you never actually had sex with him. So we were wondering if we could get the 250 bucks back. If you could toss that back our way, that'd be great.
 Is it Is it locked?
 Yeah. She's probably gettin' the money though, right? Dennis!                      
 You're such a dildo, dude.
 Thanks, dude. Thanks. That's a good way to start the day. Is that soy veggie health drink supposed to erase the damage you did to your liver last night? Is that coffee gonna help you forget that elephant you slept with last night? Oh, come on. You don't have to be so judgmental.
 She was gross, dude.
 She wasn't that gross, all right? If you lowered your standards a bit, you'd get laid more. Give me a sip of this.
 No!
 I just wanna try it. You do not get to taste my delicious healthy drink after making fun of it.
 Why not? Just give it to me.
 'Cause I don't know what kind of diseases that girl had. She doesn't have any diseases!
 Dude, she was really gross.
 Guys!
 We got a real serious problem.
 There's been a B&E, dude.
 A what?
 A B&E, dude!
 A B&E?
 What does that mean? Somebody broke into the bar and stole our safe.
 Breaking and entering. B&E.
 No. No!
 Are you serious?
 Oh, my God!
 When did this happen?
 Last night, I guess. Wejust walked in this morning and found it like that.
 Who locked up last night?
 I did. But that's the thing. The locks weren't even broken.
 So somebody just waltzed in here and stole the safe?
 But it's not my fault.
 Well, it's somebody's fault.
 I know it's somebody's fault!
 Well, it's somebody's fault!
 I know that! Guys! Guys! We're not gonna get anywhere yelling at each other!
 We need to be rational.
 All right, all right.
 Okay! I think it's clear what needs to happen.
 What? We need to buy a gun. So what do you think? I think next time you boys ought to get the kind of safe that a relatively small man can't just carry away. But there's been, like, a string of these robberies all over the area.
 You don't have any leads or
 Not really. "Not really." What in the hell does that even mean? How could there not be any leads? The guy must have left something behind.
 People are working on it.
 Hey, you guys. They're pretty sure it's the same guy who's been hittin' all the bars around here.
 We know, Charlie.
 So we're done here, Harris.
 What So that's it?
 Yeah. We'll call you if we come up with anything.
 Well, thanks.
 Yeah, thanks. You know what? Let's go get that gun.
 Whoa. Hey, hey. No, no, no, no, no.
 What? Guns are not a good idea. They're dangerous. Someone's gonna get hurt.
 Yeah. Mac, no guns.
 Guys, somebody stole our safe, right? Am I crazy? We need to be able to protect ourselves in case something like this happens again.
 Clearly, Philly's finest don't give a shit.
 Mac is absolutely right.
 What if one of us was here when it happened?
 We would have been killed.
 No, you don't know that. Come on.
 Hey, babe.
 Hey, Colin.
 Mmm.
 Was that law enforcement?
 Yeah.
 Is everything all right?
 No, dude. We got robbed last night. Oh, shit! Are you kiddin' me? Oh What happened? Remember the other day when you were making fun of us for having such a tiny safe? That really sucks, guys. Look, we have reservations at Guajino's at 12:00, and
 Yep. Just about
 Guys, it's a travesty. I'm sorry. No guns. Dude, your sister has the worst taste in men. No shit. I hate that guy. He's like a full-on '80s movie stereotype. Plus, he's a total player. What do you mean? You don't know about this? Oh, my God! That guy's dated, like, every hot bartender in town. I saw him a week ago with Wendy from Dirty Frank's. Hand all down the back of her pants.
 Oh! Gross.
 Very gross. Whatever, dude. Charlie, close up shop. Dennis, let's go get us a gun. Do you really think they're gonna buy one? No. I mean, I told them not to but Mac gets a boner every single time he thinks about a gun.
 Well, I think it's a great idea.
 I'm I'm sorry? I think it's really smart. Owning and knowing how to properly use a firearm is an important part of what makes this country great. Well, that's what I was trying to tell them
 To tell you the truth
 What? There's nothing sexier than when you're firing a gun. Actually, it really turns me on. Well, that's exactly why I want you to teach me how to use one, sexy.
 It would be my pleasure.
 I think the pleasure would be all mine. You've got a poppy seed in your teeth. Hmm.
 Get it?
 It's a big one. You might wanna go to the bathroom. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! Calm down! All right! Hwang. You're just in time, buddy.
 Charlie, my rent.
 Okay, listen.
 Listen to me for a second while I
 No! I cannot wait anymore! Don't come over here and just start yelling at me! Hwang! Hey! Wait! Let me go get something, and I'll fix it. All right, hurry up. Hurry up! I can't wait too long! Hwang not patient! You getting my money? Would you like a Rice Krispie treat?
 $854 you owe me!
 I realize how much money it is! I'm not gonna take it no more! I placed a couple bad investments! Hwang! I placed a couple of bad investments. It could happen to anyone, right? Okay. I'm going to get your goddamn money by the end of the month, okay?
 I come back tomorrow. I want my goddamn money!
 Yeah, tomorrow.
 I want my money!
 Okay. Dickhead! Okay, Dennis. We're gonna be very careful about this, right? We'll stash it right here just in case we need it. Until then, we don't go near it.
 Hopefully, we never have to pick it up again.
 Hopefully.
 You wanna shoot it?
 Yes.
 Yeah!
 Yes!
 How do you like me now, log?
 You totally killed that log, dude. I totally killed it. I always knew that I'd be good at this stuff.
 You're a really good shot, Dennis.
 Thanks, bro. You're pretty good too, Hoss.
 You hit the log, like, a bunch of times, man.
 I did. If that log was trying to rob the place, you would have killed it.
 I would have killed it!
 You totally would have killed it.
 Absolutely!
 Hey, you wanna shoot it some more?
 Yeah!
 Hey, can I load it up though?
 Absolutely! You like the sound.
 I like the sound of the clip.
 Hey!
 Hey!
 What the hell are you guys doing?
 Oh, Charlie, check it out.
 Whoa, whoa. No, no, no.
 Check it out.
 That's not fun! That's not a toy.
 Oh, come on, Charlie. I'm serious, man. You shouldn't be playing around with guns. First of all, we need to open the bar. We got robbed. Hwang is all over my ass because of rent.
 You wanna hold it?
 No. No.
 Come on. Just hold it.
 I wanna open the bar!
 Hold it for a little bit.
 No, I don't wanna hold it. Fine. Give me the gun. Fine. Yes. I'll hold the gun. Okay. Good. Nice. Really nice feel to it. That's really good. Is this thing loaded? It can be.
 That's my boy!
 Whoo! That's amazing!
 Yeah. Can you feel it?
 You bet I can feel it! Come on!
 Describe what you feel.
 I feel like, uh I feel focused and I feel badass and just, um badass, you know?
 I think he's got it, Mac.
 Yes, he does.
 Got what?
 Charlie, my boy, you've got the gun fever. Whoo! That's what I'm talking about. You seeing this?
 Yeah.
 That is sexy.
 Yep, totally.
 You feeling sexy?
 I don't know.
 Hey, hey, hey. It's all right to be a little nervous. Everyone's nervous their first time. But I promise you once you put your hand around this you are gonna love it. Well, actually, I've got something I think you'll love. I'd rather watch you shoot the gun here.
 What if I
 Just shoot the gun, Dee. Okay. Why would I not be serious?
 All right. Thanks, Detective.
 Nothing? No, nothing. I don't think they're taking this seriously on any level, dude. Of course they're not, dude. This is exactly what I'm talking about. These cops don't give a shit about us. I think it's time we took matters into our own hands.
 How?
 Maybe we should do a little investigating of our own. Do some snoopin' around, try to crack the case. We got the gun. That's true. Wanna go shoot it some more?
 Yes!
 Let's do that.
 Pow, pow, pow!
 Whoa! What the hell?
 What?
 Dude, the gun's not here.
 Holy shit! What are you talkin' about?
 Look! Look! It's
 Charlie?
 Charlie.
 Yeah, I got the gun.
 Why, Charlie? It's supposed to be here to protect the bar. Yeah, I know. I know. I just, uh
 You just what?
 I just needed it.
 Is this the gun fever talking, dude?
 No It's not I don't have the gun fever, man. Look, I'm coming in to work later. I'll bring it with me. I really don't like the sound of this, Charlie. Hey, hey, hey. I gotta go, dude. I'll see you guys at the bar. He hung up. All right! I'm coming! I'm coming! I'm coming! I'm coming! All right. Hang on a second there.
 Hey, Hwang.
 Okay, so you got my money now? I got some Rice Krispie treats in the fridge. You want some more of those? Charlie, I don't like you. I never liked you. So just give me my money, or Hwang will be forced to I'm sorry. Forced to
 What you doing?
 Hmm?
 What's that?
 So, listen, Hwang. Let me talk to you about your money for a second. Uh, I don't have it right now, you know? I just don't have it. But I'm gonna get it because I have my ways. Do you know what I mean, Hwang, when I say I have my ways? What is that? Is that a yes? Sometimes I can't understand you. You're talking, but I don't understand you. So say yes if you know what I mean when I say I have my ways.
 Yes.
 Oh, good boy. Get lost. All right. So we got the binoculars. We got the ziplock baggies. We got the Maglite. I think as soon as Charlie gets here with the gun, we're all set. This is great, dude. This is great. We're like the Hardy Boys.
 Okay.
 Okay, great. So I'll be Frank. You beJoe. 'Cause Frank was kind of the leader, and that makes a little more sense
 Didn't Frank have blond hair?
 Yeah. But that doesn't make any difference
 So I should be Frank 'cause I have lighter
 The hair color doesn't matter. It's all about who's making the plans and If we're gonna play Frank and Joe Hardy
 But I'm the leader clearly in this partnership!
 Why are we talking about this? You're right. We have a lot of work to do.
 What's the first step?
 So I'm the leader. Great. Let's roll. Wait, no. We can't go. What are you doing? We gotta open up the bar. Or we could call your sister to do her job that is if she's not having sex with Colin and every other bartender in Philadelphia.
 Don't do that. It's gross.
 Look, dude, we need to jump on this.
 Let's go do some investigating.
 All right. All Wait a second.
 What?
 Holy shit!
 I know who stole our safe.
 You do? Yeah. Let's go get that gun.
 Yeah, let's get the gun. Wait, wait. Bag, bag, bag.
 Oh, the bag.
 All right. I'm driving.
 Okay. No, I'm driving. I hope Charlie didn't do anything stupid. Whatever Charlie's doing right now, it's probably pretty stupid. Let's just hope nobody got hurt.
 Yeah.
 Yo.
 Hey, dude.
 Hey, guys.
 Can we get that gun?
 Oh. Why? Well, first of all, we shouldn't have to tell you why. We bought it. It's ours. But if you must know, it's because we know who knocked over the bar. Really? Yeah. Can we get the gun?
 Why?
 Because we know who Okay, you know what, dude? Move. Oh, this place is a shit-hole, Charlie. It smells. So, don't you wanna know who did it?
 Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Who was it?
 Colin.
 Oh.
 Mm-hmm. Yeah. Think about it. It all makes sense. Colin goes around town with every hot bartender chick, right? He woos them with his charm and his good looks. He finds out where the safes are. He finds out how to get in. You remember when Sweet Dee said that he was laughing about how small the safe was? You saw how quickly he changed the subject when she brought that safe up. Right. All right. So what's the plan? I'll slide the gun meaningfully into the front of my pants
 I know that game.
 Yeah.
 So why don't you go get it?
 Go get the gun! All right. Here.
 Oh!
 Do you want it? Hey, Dee. Are you with Colin right now? Oh, no. He had to meet someone at Fingers Bar, huh?
 Nice.
 Okay. Why don't you take the night off, okay? You deserve it.
 All right. You're welcome. Bye.
 Pow, pow, pow.
 You ready?
 Ready, Freddy. Oh. It goes Uh, stick it back in
 What a penis!
 Like you wouldn't do such a thing?
 Come on. Let's nail this prick.
 Wait. Hold on a second. Didn't Fingers already get robbed?
 Uh, yeah.
 So what's this guy doing, going in for round two?
 I don't know. Can we do this thing?
 Wait. Hold on. Do you think this guy would be dumb enough to rob the same bar twice?
 Yeah, I do.
 Me too. All right, change of plans. Leave the gun. I'm gonna get this asshole to hit Paddy's again. Follow my lead. I'm the leader.
 Hey, Colin!
 Colin!
 What are you doing here?
 Hey, fellas. Didn't expect to see you here.
 Yeah. I was just Actually, I was leaving.
 Leaving?
 Having a little drink, huh? Little drinky-poo.
 Couple drinks?
 Yeah. Just, uh Yeah, just a little drink.
 Yeah? What's up, man? You seem like, uh, the cat who ate the canary. No Canary No, I was just I didn't expect to see you guys here.
 Why?
 Well, I thought you'd be at Paddy's. Paddy's, no. We actually closed up shop for the night.
 Yeah.
 Yeah. Thought we'd get wasted here instead, you know?
 Just a little freaked out about the robbery.
 Yeah. But, actually, funny story. Turns out the dickhead didn't actually get all of our money.
 We actually keep it in the register instead of the safe.
 Yeah. So the stupid asshole didn't even think to look there, right?
 What a cock!
 What an idiot! What an idiot! What a total idiot, right?
 Boner, really.
 Schmuck.
 Stupid idiot.
 Yeah, so, you know. As soon as we get some new locks, we should be all set.
 Yeah.
 So we're just probably gonna hop in here
 Grab a couple drinks here tonight.
 Yeah, get wasted.
 Maybe pass out.
 Or walk home with a couple of hot waitresses. Right, Colin? Yeah, totally. Yeah.
 All right, well, don't wanna keep you.
 Yeah.
 We'll see you later. You look spiffy, bro.
 Yeah, you look good.
 Maybe you guys should get a gun.
 What? Well, Dee was saying that you were thinking about getting a gun. I think it's a good idea. Good protection. I, uh I keep one on me all the time. I don't know. Think about it.
 Absolutely.
 Enjoy your drinky.
 Yeah.
 We will. All right, man.
 Have a good night, bro. Yeah.
 See you later.
 He's got a gun on him at all times.
 From now on, so will we. Dude, you just laid it on way too thick back there. There's no way he's gonna hit Paddy's again tonight. He'd have to be a moron. He is a moron, dude. He'll be there. Hey, Dee. Yeah, listen. There's a change of plans. I need you to meet us at Paddy's tonight after all. Something you need to see.
 Why did you guys bring me into this?
 You'll see.
 Did you turn off the circuit breaker?
 Yeah, dude. We're all set. Check.
 What the hell was that?
 Did you just cock back the hammer, bro?
 No.
 Wait a second. You guys have a gun? Hey, listen to me. We are not shooting anybody tonight.
 I know.
 Dennis, you are not shooting anyone! I don't want to shoot anyone, Sweet Dee!
 You better not shoot anybody.
 I don't have
 I should be holding the gun.
 I have better
 Well, I put this whole thing together.
 I shot the log way more times!
 This is so bad.
 But I'm the one who has better aim than you! What? What? Is he here?
 Oh, there he is.
 Okay.
 What's he doing?
 He's walking toward the cash register. Oh, he looks shady. Yeah. That's him. That's it. Do the flashlight.
 Turn the flashlight on!
 I can't reach it! No, no! He's getting away!
 Shoot him!
 What?
 Shoot him!
 Shoot him in his face! Shit!
 Did you get him?
 I'm shot!
 Charlie? Oh, my God!
 Oh, my god! Turn on the circuit breaker! Turn on the circuit breaker!
 Did you shoot me, Dennis?
 L Uh, no. L
 Why did you shoot me?
 Oh, my God!
 My God! Dude, are you okay?
 Where are you shot?
 In my head!
 What? Oh, my God! Charlie, I shot you in your head. I am so sorry.
 Is he okay?
 No, I'm not okay! He shot me in my head!
 No. It must havejust grazed his head.
 You shot him in the head, bro!
 If I shot him in the head, he'd be dead.
 It really hurts!
 I gotta go to a hospital!
 All right, man. I'll call an ambulance. The hospital's, like, three blocks away. We should just drive him! I know that. But I don't wanna get blood stains all over the interior of my car. Are you serious? All right! I'll take you to a hospital! God! All right, get a trash bag. We'll put it over him.
 I can't believe you shot Charlie, dude.
 Don't start this again!
 You almost killed our best friend.
 You told me to shoot Charlie! You guys told me to shoot Charlie. The minute the shit hits the fan, you guys are, like, "Dennis, don't shoot the gun!"
 I was not!
 Then all of a sudden, you told me to shoot him in the face! I didn't say that!
 Hey.
 Hey, there he is. How you feeling, buddy? You shot me, dude. But, Charlie, you were stealing from the bar. It was an honest mistake. I still kind of wish you didn't shoot me.
 If you needed help with money, why didn't you talk to us?
 Yeah, man. L I had it all worked out, all right? I was gonna make it look like all the other robberies going on around town. Then we would collect some insurance money and
 Wow, dude. That's really just goddamn ridiculous.
 That is so dumb.
 I thought it was the best idea I ever had.
 No, it's not at all.
 But you know what?
 It might be the best idea you've ever had, but Listen. Listen. The important thing is that you are all right. And we talked about it, and we decided we need to get rid of that gun. Oh, oh, the gun. Yeah, we're getting rid of the gun.
 It's too dangerous.
 You could have been killed. Dennis could have killed you. Okay, good. Yes. I think that would be for the best. Ah. Mmm. Dee, could you get me a nurse? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure. Tell me we're not getting rid of that gun. No way!
 Never.
 Sweet. No, he's fine. It turns out itjust kind of grazed his head. Oh, that's great news, babe. Thank you so much for calling though. You are so sweet, Colin. I guess I'm just a sweet guy. All right. Well, I'll see you tomorrow?
 You will.
 Okay. Good night. Dream of me. Idiots.                     You're being ridiculous. He's a professional football player. I'm not talking about killing the guy. I'm talking about going with a group and intimidate him, maybe break his arm.
 You can't break Tom Brady's arm.
 Yes, I can. No more Super Bowls for that pretty boy. Listen. Let me tell you something with absolute honesty and concern for your well-being. Tom Brady would kick your ass.
 What the hell is that?
 Come on, who locked up last night?
 Charlie.
 The kid needs to start paying attention.
 Who is this?
 I don't know. I've never seen him before. Well, can you get him out of here? He stinks. Hey, let's go. Oh, my Je Oh, my God. He shit his pants, Dee. Oh, I don't wanna know that. I'm gonna poke him with this. Get up, old man. This isn't the American Legion. Wake up!
 Yo!
 What's the matter?
 He won't wake up.
 Well, poke him harder in his ribs. Wake up, old man. Wake up! Holy shit. That bitch is dead. This ought to do wonders for business. How could you let this happen, Charlie? What? It's not my fault. The guy orders one drink sits down, I don't see him again the rest of the night. What are we gonna do about this booth? There's piss and shit everywhere.
 All the death germs.
 Plus, that guy was so old.
 Old people are gross.
 Tell you what. I'll get the gasoline.
 We're not gonna burn it.
 Come on, dude. You never let me burn anything.
 Maybe we should close to fumigate or something.
 No, no. We can't do that. We can't let anybody know that this happened. We'll never live it down. Are we gonna serve drinks today? I don't think the board of health will be too keen on that. I'm sorry. Do you see any representatives from the board of health here? Let's clean up the mess and act like it never happened.
 I'm not getting anywhere near that booth.
 Me neither. I can't believe you guys are making me do this. I can't believe you left a dead guy in the bar overnight. So I guess we're even. Charlie, the E. M. T. Said he had a heart attack, not Ebola.
 Do you wanna do this?
 No. Then don't question my methods. Whoa, Charlie! Stop! Stop, stop, stop, stop. Goddamn it. We need to isolate the area. You're just gonna spread whatever parts of him decomposed overnight.
 No.
 What, are you a scientist, dude?
 A scientist?
 That's, like, science talk. Science talk? What the hell is science talk? I'm sorry. We're closed. No, we're not. Hey. How you doing?
 I'm looking for the owner.
 That's me. Actually
 Actually, I'm the owner.
 I could help her out now.
 We own it together.
 Not really. What can I help you with? My name is Rebecca Keane. I was notified that my grandfather died here last night.
 Oh.
 Oh, I'm so sorry.
 That's really horrible.
 I'm sorry for your loss. I, uh I just wanted to see where he spent his last night. Hmm, that would be somewhere in this vicinity over here.
 Oh, God.
 Are you all right? Yeah, I'm okay. L I really didn't know him that well actually. But he didn't have any other family, so the police called me.
 Oh, that's so sad.
 Yeah. I guess I was a little curious, you know. I mean, he's my grandfather. And I know nothing about him.
 Yeah. Well, he was a great man.
 Really? Yeah. Yeah, just a very warm and gentle soul actually.
 So you knew him?
 Yeah, I wouldn't actually say that I knew him all that well. I knew him pretty well. Yeah, we got pretty close near the end there.
 Wow, really?
 I knew him too. L- I just meant I thought you meant more of a
 He didn't know him as well as I did though.
 Oh. Well, listen, I should go. I have to get back to work. I just wanted to stop in. Of course. Well, listen, if you ever wanna stop by, you know I could tell you some stories about your grandfather that you would not believe. L- I'll make myself available as well. Don't worry about it. Yeah, any time. Okay. Thanks.
 Yeah, of course.
 Bye.
 What are you doing, dude?
 What?
 You're totally blowing up my spot.
 I'm not blowing up your spot. You can't just claim the girl for yourself. She's way out of your league anyway. Out of my league? She's out of your league. I could get that chick. Hey, guys! A man died here yesterday. His family just abandoned him. Could we think about that for one second? Why the hell would we want to think about that?
 Really depressing, Dee.
 It just makes me think about Pop-Pop is all. Pop-Pop is an asshole, Sweet Dee. And I'm placing my bets that that girl's grandfather is an asshole too. People don't just abandon their parents for no good reason. Dude, have you ever been to a nursing home? People abandon their parents all the time. It's a sad, throwaway culture we live in.
 Hey, Charlie. Can I come in?
 Hi.
 Yeah, sure.
 Thank you. Whoa. Geez, your place is looking good. Yeah. I've been doing some rearra rearranging.
 Mm-hmm.
 So you wanna have a seat?
 Uh, no, I don't. Charlie, your, uh
 Have a seat, come on. Listen, I wanted to ask you a favor. Will you go to the nursing home with me to see my grandfather? Dennis won't go.
 Dennis won't go?
 No, he won't go.
 What a jerk.
 I know, and I haven't seen him since I was really little. And he's stuck in that nursing home. And I don't wanna wait until it's too late and then regret it. Why don't you just go by yourself? Uh, I have a little bit of a problem with old people. Sounds a little mean, but I find them kind of creepy and scary and gross. I think they're gross. It's their hands mostly. You know, how you can see right through them. They're all Their inside business is I'll tell you what. I'll go with you but you have to let me borrow your car any time I want. No.
 Every now and then.
 No.
 One time.
 All right. And you have to take me to lunch
 twice a week for a year.
 No, I don't.
 Once a week. Today.
 Okay. Great.
 I can get hot chicks, dude.
 Mac, don't embarrass yourself. I will always win in these circumstances. You will not, dude. She's coming over here to see me. She's coming to see you because you answered the phone, dude. That's just semantics, bro. You know, I have a real shot with this chick. You can't beat me here, okay? I will always win in these circumstances. I will one-up you. I'm sharper than you.
 You're not sharper. Shut up. Shut up.
 You shut up.
 Don't tell me to shut up.
 Hi, guys. Is this a bad time? No, this is a great time. We were just We We were talking about your grandfather. Emotions are running very high around here today. Yeah, it's been a difficult couple of days for me. Yeah, I try not to think about me though in circumstances like this. More importantly, how are you? You kind oflook like you're gonna pass out. Charlie, I don't think I can do this. I'm not kidding. Come on. You're gonna be fine.
 Oh, my God. Look at that one.
 Hey, hey, hey, hey. They have ears, all right? All right, listen to me, Dee. The slow and painful crawl to death is an inevitable part of life. So just embrace it, all right? Wait, wait, wait. It's really creepy in here.
 What is that very bad smell?
 Uh, it's probably urine and maybe some feces.
 17-D, right? This is your Pop-Pop's door.
 Just hold on a second.
 What if he asks us to help him go to the bathroom?
 Are you kidding me? Come on. A lot of people lead perfectly normal lives in nursing homes. Oh, Jesus! He doesn't even look like a real person.
 Should we go wake him up?
 No! I don't know. Let's go. No, we can't go. We came all the way down here. Let's just
 I need some air.
 What? No, no, no, Dee. Do not leave me here alone. 'Cause I can't Dennis.
 Dennis.
 Oh, this is awkward. I'm I'm not Dennis, come here. L- I've been waiting a long time for this moment, Dennis. Okay. You have? Oh, yeah. My only grandson finally come to see me. Come close. My eyesight's not so good. You're lot shorter than I thought you'd wind up. Yeah, well, you know. I'm actually still growin', so
 You want some candy?
 No, I'm good. Thanks. Eat the damn candy! Okay. Candy. These people in here they've stolen everything from me.
 They have?
 Yeah, well, what do you expect from Jews, right, Dennis? Uh Jews. Um, maybe I should go and check on Dee, because No, leave her be. I'm sure she'll be fine. I'm an old man, Dennis. And as you can see, I don't have much time left. I need your help. Oh. Oh, no, no, no. I mean, I'm not very comfortable with that. First of all, I don't even know which one of these things I would unplug. No, you idiot! I don't need you to kill me. I need you to help me. Oh. Uh, okay. You probably don't know this because that bastard father of yours didn't tell you but I was a war hero.
 Really?
 I wanna be buried in my uniform. And I don't trust any of these kikes in here to take care of that. All the belongings from that part of my life are in a box at the Roxborough Storage Facility. I need you to pick it up and bring it here. Oh, okay, sure. I could do that. And I need you to keep it as a secret between you and me. Okay. So listen, I have a favor to ask you guys. Oh, yeah. That's cool. Anything, yeah. You can talk to me, 'cause I get things done, so I'm in charge of putting together a memorial service for him but I can't seem to find anyone else who really knew him that well. Oh, yeah. That might be difficult to do actually. It's not gonna be a problem. I knew a lot of his friends. Good guys. Yeah, Den. But, uh, it might be hard to find "friends." It's not gonna be hard for me. That would be so amazing.
 Would you like another drink?
 No, we're fine.
 I need your car.
 Oh, Charlie. I wasn't really serious about that.
 No. Go get it. You promised.
 Fine.
 Where you going?
 Going back to see Pop-Pop. What the hell you talking about? You're going to see my Pop-Pop without me?
 Mm-hmm.
 You can't do that. He's my Pop-Pop. I'm the one who's supposed to feel better about myself. I'm going with you. Oh, you can't actually, because it's just supposed to be me and him.
 I want to see my Pop-Pop.
 Take the bus. Jesus, Dennis. This is just goddamn shady. Hey, bud. If you wanna back out now, be my guest.
 I'd be happy to take all the credit for this.
 I'm not backing down. All right, all right. Hey, pal. How would you like to make 20 bucks?
 Sure.
 Got some nicer clothes?
 Right.
 Right. Holy shit. Okay, guys. Have fun. Mingle.
 Hey, guys.
 Hey, Rebecca.
 Rebecca. I see you brought some of my grandfather's friends. He loved those guys. So I was wondering if maybe you guys could say something. You know, maybe tell a funny story about him or something. Oh, yeah. No, absolutely. Actually, I've got a little something prepared. If that's okay. Mac, did you prepare Oh, no. Sorry. I totally forgot. He's a terrible public speaker. He gets really flustered and he clams up and his third-grade stutter comes back. It's adorable. Oh, is that your phone?
 Yeah.
 Gonna answer that?
 Well, I don't wanna be rude.
 Well, the ringer's going off in the middle of a funeral. It's gotta be pretty important, right? Excuse me.
 Charlie, what do you want?
 Mac, you gotta come to my apartment right now. I can't, dude. I'm in the middle of something. I don't care what you're doing. Get over here right now! It's an emergency! Fine.
 I gotta go. It's an emergency.
 You gotta leave? That's a shame.
 So can I borrow your car, or what?
 You've been drinking. Uh He's a good guy. He's just got a bit of a drinking problem.
 Who is it?
 It's Mac, dude. This better be good. Holy shit! Mmm.
 This is unbelievable!
 I know that! There are, like, so many medals in there, dude! This guy was probably, like, king Nazi.
 How is this even possible, Charlie?
 Oh, it's possible.
 They came on boats or whatever, but they're here.
 Okay, hold on.
 This could just be collector's crap.
 No. No, no, no. No. Look at that!
 He looks exactly like Dennis.
 I know. All right, so here's the deal. He wants me to take all this shit to him so he can be, like, buried in it or something. Buried in it? Screw that old bitch. He's a Nazi. Let him die and burn in hell, right? Let's sell this shit on eBay. No, I thought about that though. I think it's, like illegal, or maybe a little bit immoral.
 We could sell it to a museum.
 I could live with that. Lionel Keane. As we all know, Lionel could be a bit of a curmudgeon. But he had the heart of a lion. I'll tell you a story about him. It was Christmas Eve last year and, uh I was at Lionel's house, making him dinner. And we got to talking about the spirit of giving. And I said, "Lionel, why are we just talking about it? Let's put the spirit into action. Let's go down to the mission." Lionel said, "Great. That's a great idea, Dennis." So we did, we went down there. And not only did we feed every last poor, miserable, precious soul but we washed the feet of every man, woman and child there in the spirit of Christ. And that was Lionel. Lionel Keane. Lionel the lion.
 Sorry to keep you gentlemen waiting.
 Not a problem at all.
 How can I help you?
 We are going to make your day today, sir.
 Is that right?
 We've gotten our hands on a "little something" that we like to think is an important part of human history and needs to be in this museum. Mac, if you will. What in the hell is that? This, my friend, is an authentic Nazi officer's uniform circa 1942. Notice the stitching and fine attention to detail. Where did you get this? Let's just say it found its way to us and leave it at that, shall we? Okay. I find this offensive for so many reasons. I'm guessing you acquired this through illegal means. For me to take this from you would be an extension of that. And secondly, that you would expect it would "make my day" assumes that I'm interested in profiting off the murder of millions of innocent people. How much will you give us for it? Nothing. Nothing, or I plan to call the police the minute you guys leave my office.
 Hey, Pop-Pop.
 Deandra? What are you doing here? Where's Dennis? Oh, um, I just came by myself. Oh. Well, do you know where Dennis is? He was supposed to be here hours ago. No, no. Pop-Pop, it's just me. I thought that you and I could spend some time together so I brought a couple books that I could read to you. Okay, fine. Come here and sit down. Yeah. No, why don't you come closer so I can get a good look at you?
 Come here, come here.
 Okay, that's fine.
 Sure, sure, sure.
 Good idea. Come here. A little closer. Come here. Come on, come on. Come here, come here. Oh, now I remember how beautiful you are. And look at these wrinkled old hands against your young face. Oh, and and these teeth. Look. Look how straight and white. Is there a bathroom around here? Yeah. Right down the hall. We're doing the right thing here, man. Yeah. But it just seems like a waste of a perfectly good Nazi uniform. No, no, no. If we sell it, we run the risk of going to jail. And if we keep it, we don't get anything, so we may as well burn it.
 That's true.
 I mean, it is always fun to burn things. Yeah. Yeah, it is. And we probably shouldn't let Dennis know about his grandfather anyway.
 No.
 It might just screw with his head.
 Yeah, get it going.
 All right.
 Get on.
 Get on it.
 Auf Wiedersehen.
 Auf Wiedersehen, my friend.
 Whoo.
 Whoo.
 So it's all in there, right?
 Yeah.
 You didn't keep anything, or
 No. Did you?
 No. No, dude.
 Okay.
 Hey, guys.
 Hey, bro.
 Hey.
 What's up? What you burning?
 Some trash.
 Awesome.
 Do you wanna hear what happened with that girl?
 No. No, I don't, dude. No? Oh, come on.
 I don't care about what happened.
 Of course you care.
 I don't wanna hear it, Dennis.
 Yeah, you do. Okay. You know what, bro? I'm sorry. You win. Okay? I give up. You won. You're the better man. You don't give up. See, I won fair and square. We went head-to-head and I came out the better man, just as I predicted I would. So we went back to her house and we made sweet, passionate love.
 Great.
 Yeah. Great for you. You You must be really proud of yourself. Awesome. Your grandfather's a Nazi. Who's your neighbor? I'm your neighbor. But let me ask you a couple questions.
 Go ahead, shoot.
 Ask away.
 Who lives in this here hole?
 What hole?
 That big brown hole.
 Oh, I'm inside that hole.
 Dozen Rangers in there too.
 All right. Well                      
 On the side.
 You didn't do that on purpose.
 Otherwise that would have been a great shot.
 Watch this. Side pocket.
 Holy shit!
 What? "Christopher Murray, a teacher at St. Vincent's Elementary has been accused of sexually abusing two former students."
 St. Vincent's? That's that school you went to, right, Mac?
 Yeah, me and Charlie. What else does it say? "Murray has been the physical education teacher and boys' basketball coach for 25 years." Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Ah. "The accusers are two brothers whose names are being withheld "but the investigation will focus on the mid-1980s "as the time period for alleged abuse. The police are hoping more young men will come forward."
 Wow. That's horrible.
 Did this guy teach you guys?
 Yeah.
 No. Yes, he did. We were in the same class. No. Yeah. Well, no, I didn't like it though.
 What the hell are you talking about?
 I didn't like that class.
 What?
 I gotta go! Holy shit. Charlie got molested. When dealing with molestation, the first step is always understanding. So we need to take a moment and assess the situation. Write this down. What? No, look. First of all, we can't sit around and let him wallow in it. And second of all, the first step is acknowledgment. So I better write that down.
 No. No, no.
 Whoa! What, guys What the hell are you guys talking about? Sweet Dee and I took psychology at Penn, so let the grown-ups talk.
 Okay? Thank you.
 Okay? Listen. I think we need to have an intervention. You know, bring his friends and family together for support. Yeah, that's a good idea. Let's tell everybody Charlie knows that he got blown by a gym teacher. Then we'll throw him a little surprise party, celebrate the occasion. Okay, you know what? You being a smartass not helping Charlie. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Who said anything about getting blown? The article didn't specify what type of abuse it was. It could have been anything. Yeah, but do you think he got blown?
 I don't know.
 Yeah, you know? Probably got blown. Which is why I think you need to reconsider my idea. Okay. You know what? Stop. I'm sorry. We need to clarify something here. Do you think that Murray blew these guys? Why are you so obsessed with the blowing aspect of all this? Because I knew these two brothers that the article was talking about. The McPoyle twins Ryan and Liam. Okay? They were the type of kids that would blow snot bubbles and rub 'em over each other. They were gross, and they smelled like a couple of unwiped assholes. So what? Well, if Murray is, like, fondling or touching them, whatever I get it, all right? But if he's dishing out blow jobs, come on.
 I just don't understand.
 What do you not get?
 What are you talking about?
 You're not getting this? I was in that class with them, all right? I was with those guys!
 Um, are you okay, dude?
 No, dude. I'm not okay. How come you're getting so upset? The police are asking for more young men to come forward. That means there are more guys out there who've been blown.
 What are you looking for?
 Photographs. I have photographs.
 Oh, my God. You have photographs of it?
 Oh! Okay. Listen, are you trying to say that you got molested? Okay, look at this. Look at this guy, huh? I was cute. I was energetic. I was fun. I mean, what exactly was this prick looking for?
 What are you
 Sorry? If the McPoyles got blown and Charlie got blown then why didn't I get blown?
 You're goin' to hell, dude.
 Seriously. Yo! McPoyle! Hey, open up! Hey, Charlie. Long time no see.
 What do you want?
 Is your brother here, man? I gotta talk to you guys.
 Yeah?
 Yeah!
 Can I come in?
 Yeah. Come on, man. I need to talk to you guys. Go. Move. Go. Go. Come on.
 I'm not gonna walk in front of you! Go.
 Just come in.
 No, you go first, and I will follow you.
 Shut the door. I will shut the door.
 Whoa. That was really weird.
 Yeah. Well, this confirms it. He definitely got molested. Ugh. We gotta get in there.
 Get We gotta get in there?
 Yes. You can't just thrust yourself in the position of caregiver like that. "Caregiver"? Why are you throwing around big words?
 I actually majored in psych, so
 You failed all your classes.
 So?
 I had a minor, and I passed all mine. Well, you know what? Three-quarters of a major is bigger than a whole minor.
 I don't even know how to respond to that.
 That doesn't surprise me. Well, it shouldn't because what you said is really dumb, you know.
 That's a good one.
 Yeah, it is.
 That was good. I liked that one.
 I felt good about it.
 So did you want a beverage of some kind?
 No! Where's your brother? We just stepped out of the shower. He'll be down in a minute. Listen, you guys can't go
 Did you just say "we"?
 What? Did you just say, "We just stepped out of the shower"? I said "he." Right. Okay. Listen. I heard about the Coach Murray thing. You guys cannot go to the police and say that he molested you.
 Why not?
 Because he didn't molest you! That's true, but he's a dick, and we hated him.
 This is our chance for revenge. You want in?
 No! I think you do.
 Hello, Charlie.
 Hello, Ryan. I don't know if you've been paying attention to the news recently but there are millions to be made here, my friend. Oh, sure, there's the classic route of priest molestation but we thought we'd mix it up a bit. We're going after the whole damn school board. If you want in on the team, we could probably get a nice class-action suit going. Okay. Okay, first of all, there are people out there who actually have been molested. And you guys are gonna exploit that for your own personal gain? You assholes are securing your place in hell.
 We thought about it. We're willing to roll the dice.
 I won't let you do it.
 I'm gonna call the cops.
 Oh, no, you won't, Charlie.
 Oh, yes, I will.
 Oh, my friend, I'm afraid not.
 And why not?
 We'll tell the cops the whole thing was your idea. We should tell the cops that that fat dickhead gym teacher we had in junior high molested us and just sue the shit out of him!
 L I was joking.
 Really? I'm not joking though. I'm not joking. I'm really not. I wouldn't even joke about something like that. We should do it. I wanna do it. Shit. We'd hate to have to put this whole thing on your shoulders.
 Shit.
 So you're gonna have to keep your mouth shut. You don't have to join us, but if anyone asks you point-blank Your ass got molested. Otherwise, we're talking conspiracy charges. And prison can be a bad place for someone like you, Charlie. A very bad place. Soon as Charlie comes out, we gotta grab him, take him back to the bar get him liquored up and tell him, "We know you got molested." Gonna have to disagree with you, Sis. I think we need to ease him into it. There he is. Okay, you know what? Dr. Gainer used to say that in situations like this Dr. Gainer? That guy was an idiot.
 He was not.
 Yes, he was.
 Talk about molesters. That guy
 He didn't molest me.
 I had sex with him 'cause I wanted to.
 You had sex with Dr. Gainer?
 Of course I did.
 No, you had Oh!
 He was a hot older man.
 Gross! Okay. You know what? You have no room to talk. All the girls you've molested. Whoa, whoa. Don't start throwing that word around like it's meaningless, okay?
 This is serious.
 Fine.
 Fine.
 Great. Molester.
 Hey, Coach Murray!
 Yeah? It's me Mac! I don't know what this shit is all about. One day the cops just roll into my classroom and they haul me out of there. And they did it right in front of my kids too.
 Yeah. Totally.
 Molestation? I mean, please! I got so much ass back in those days. What the hell did I need that kind of shit for? God, man, I hear you. So much ass, it was like Whew. Oh, and you know what, to tell you the truth? I don't even remember who these assholes are that are accusing me.
 Nothing special there, right?
 I guess. Nothing special. You know, Coach, I've been working out a lot since grammar school.
 Good for you, son.
 Yeah, it's good for you, right? You know when you get real tight, like, right up in here in this area here?
 You know what I mean?
 Yeah. Not here. Like right in here. What are you doing? What do you want me to do? All right. L Okay.
 Oh!
 That's a good shot, bud. Hey, tell me something, man. What's been going on with you lately?
 You just seem
 You know, um, I'm just distracted. Is that why you ran out of the bar the other day? No. No. I was I had some stuff I needed to do.
 It just popped in my head.
 Yeah, well, that's understandable.
 We've all got things that we have to do.
 Yeah. What you running from, Charlie? What?
 Dee, could you grab me a beer?
 Grab one yourself.
 I'm right in the middle of a game.
 Your game isn't working.
 Let me play now.
 Let me play the game the way I want to play it.
 Your way is dumb, and it's not working.
 Then we'll play your game. It's not gonna get the results we want. You're playing a game for children, and it's not working. Charlie's not a baby. Charlie! Great. Nice. Good job, Dennis. Great. How are you gonna put this on me? You messed it up!
 You messed it up!
 We have to push him! Push him? You're pushing him away. Now he knows something's up.
 Good.
 Good? Guys, I have good news! I've been reading up on the subject of pedophilia. It turns out that it isn't about sex after all. It's about power. So, the assailant doesn't go after the one he finds most attractive this guy. He goes after the weakest he can find. Wow. That is good news.
 Jesus, Mac. What is wrong with you?
 No. You're not following. If Murray was looking for the weakest he could find, it wouldn't have been Charlie.
 Why not?
 Because Charlie was a bit of a psychopath. When he got excited, his face would turn purple and he'd start biting things. I don't think Murray would've put his dick anywhere near him.
 What about the McPoyle brothers?
 They were prime real estate.
 I'm sure he went to town on them.
 What's your point? Charlie didn't get molested. What?
 Good. I'm sure he didn't.
 Oh, boy.
 I'm sure he didn't.
 Yeah. Leave this to the two people that are qualified to deal with the situation. It is cute that you did some research and got four books though.
 Nice work.
 Yeah, goodjob. You know what? We tried it your little tippy-toe pussy way. That failed miserably. So now why don't we try something that will work? Look, I just want to say that I think this is a terrible approach. You know how I already know that? 'Cause you keep saying it. I keep saying it because it is. I'm sorry you're wrong about stuff all the time.
 I'm sorry that you're sorry all the time.
 What?
 That doesn't make any sense.
 I don't care.
 Well, hello, Dennis!
 Hi, Mrs. Kelly. Don't you look so handsome!
 And, Dee, so beautiful.
 Thank you, Mrs. Kelly. I'm sorry we had to stop by like this, but we really need to talk to you about something.
 What?
 It's about Charlie. Oh, I can't believe this! I just can't believe it! Though I have to admit, it does explain a lot about him. Yes, we were thinking the same thing. Yes. Oh. Be strong, Bonnie. Be strong for your little gingerbread man. Now is not the time for an episode.
 Are you okay?
 I'm fine! So, what do you need from me? Hello? Ma? In here, Charlie! Hey, I got your message. You sounded kinda funny.
 Come on back, honey.
 Is everything all right? Hello, Charlie. Mom? Grandma? UncleJack? What's What's everybody doing here? Well, we've all gathered here at the request of your friends.
 Hey, bud.
 Hi, Charlie. Hello, Charles. L I don't exactly know how one of these things are supposed to go. But we understand that there's been some abuse. These two boys have been strong enough to admit what happened and we thank you for that. Just hope that that man goes away for a long, long time. Prison can be a bad place for a guy like that. Very bad place. Now, we're not exactly sure how this thing is supposed to go. But your friends have been helping us out on a couple of key points. Now? Okay, Charlie, show us on the doll. Show you what?
 Where he touched you.
 Oh, yeah. Shall I turn it over? Yeah, turn her over. Do it. Slow. Slow.
 I think that went well.
 You did a wonderful job, Charlie.
 I really think they bought it.
 Oh, yeah. Definitely. I gotta say, my favorite part was at the end there when we were all hugging and my sister screamed and told everyone that I touched her vagina. Yeah! So, Charlie where to? Oh, well, I was thinking we should, uh, zip down to the police station file an official report.
 I gotta do it sometime, right?
 That's the spirit. Let's get it on the books. Excuse me. I'd like to, uh, speak to a detective, please.
 Name?
 Charlie Kelly. And what is this in reference to? Sodomy. Okay. Uh, take a seat. Someone will be right with you. You're doing the right thing, Charlie. The American school system's been oppressing people for years. It's about time we start doing a little oppressing ourselves.
 That doesn't make sense.
 Yes, it does. How are we oppressing anything? You need to think before you speak.
 You do.
 Charlie Kelly? Oh. That's me. Uh, I'll be right back. Have a good time. Twenty-five million is a lot of clams.
 Split it 50-50.
 Charlie's gonna want something. How 'bout Charlie? Yeah. He'll want some. He's not gonna get some. We could always split it 50-50-50. You even hear what you're saying? Your gums are bleeding.
 How'd it go?
 Great. I just ratted you out. Can I see you two boys for a minute, please?
 So you're not gonna get in any trouble at all?
 Uh, no. No, not really. And since the McPoyles are gonna plead guilty, I'm off the hook completely.
 That's great.
 Sorry. Was he saying that the intervention worked?
 No, I don't think that's what he's saying.
 What are you talking about? It was the final push Charlie needed. Turns out three-quarters of a major not so bad after all. And the best part of it, actually, for me now is the fact that everybody thinks that I've been molested. So, in a way, my life is ruined. In the meantime, I'm gonna go in the back office and cry and cry and cry and drink for a while. Emotional release.
 Another giant step forward.
 My God, we're good.
 Doctor.
 Doctor. Yeah, yeah. I mean, so I just want to apologize again for the other day.
 It's all right, Mac. Don't worry about it.
 Awkward, right? You know what? You were a good student at school. You got potential.
 Just put that in your pocket.
 Really? You mean that?
 I mean that.
 Great, Coach. That's all I really needed to hear.
 Good.
 That is so great for me.
 Hey, say hi to those folks for me.
 I will. Thanks. All right. That little prick's goin' to hell.                     Come on. Just one more race.
 Every time we race, you lose.
 You always lose. One more race, and then we'll go to the strip club. All right. Three, two, one.
 Goddamn it!
 What is wrong with you?
 Super slow drinker over here.
 Do you have, like, a little throat or something?
 Dennis. We gotta get out of here now.
 Why? I just got off the phone with Dad. He wants to stop by and talk to us.
 What does Dad want?
 I don't know! Let's go before we have to deal with this! Let's get out of here before you guys get around your father. Let's just take care of one more Don't Don't be grabby. Okay. Dennis, I need to borrow $20.
 What, dude?
 Just give me some money, man.
 How come you don't ever have any money?
 Dee? Moneys?
 No way.
 What are you gonna do at the strip club with
 Will you just get in the car!
 No, no! It sucks for me, 'cause you guys get all the girls and the attention! My dad's gonna be here in a second! Will you get in the car!
 No! I'm going home! I'm going home.
 Oh!
 Can we go? Please!
 Yeah, we can go. We can go.
 Dennis!
 Oh, Jesus! Dennis, no! Dennis, you son of a bitch! What the hell is wrong with you, Dad? Why would you come sneaking around the bar in the middle of the night? You don't snoop and sneak and appear in front of cars and start yelling names!
 No!
 I had something very important to tell you. Really? What could be so important it couldn't wait till the morning? There's nothing more important than the fact that we just hit our friend with a car. Oh, yeah? Try this on for size. Your mother's dead.
 No.
 What? Oh, my God! No, she's not dead. We're gettin' divorced though.
 Why
 Why
 What
 What
 Why would you say that she's dead?
 That's a business tactic. You drop the bomb, then you soften the blow. You never tried this?
 That is a terrible business tactic!
 You are a horrible father. That's what I came to talk to you about. I hate the kind of person that your whore mother turned me into. The big house, the big car I'm giving it all away.
 Hmm?
 Giving it away how? For starters, I'm giving all my money to charity. Then I'm gonna hang out with you two. That's what this is all about spending time with my kids.
 Hold on a second.
 I wanna be the father that I never was.
 Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
 Getting to know them.
 What did you say about the money?
 Mm-hmm.
 I'm giving it all away.
 That is a very stupid thing to do. You're a very stupid, stupid man. Who are you gonna give it to? I don't know. Poor people.
 Poor people?
 Poor people? What What is your prob Okay, where's Mom? Mom? She's on vacation banging one of the boys she hangs out with.
 Dennis, your mother is a dirty, dirty whore.
 Oh, goddamn it, Dad! First you force me to run over my friend Charlie. And then you start talking about Mom like she's dead.
 Now you're saying she's a dirty whore?
 The money.
 You can't waltz back into our lives and be our dad again!
 And the money.
 It doesn't work that way. You can't just barge in!
 And the money! And the money! My God, Dad! All of our money? Well, that was awkward.
 Yes, it was.
 Sort of a private conversation.
 Very much a family type moment.
 We didn't need to hear any of that. Not for our ears. Wanna go to the strip club? I don't know. I've been manically depressed for the past couple of years. I just feel like I need a serious change, or I'm gonna kill myself. So when you say you're giving your money away to poor people do you mean, like, "Mexico" poor, or can it be, like, "me and Charlie" poor?
 Well, I haven't given that much thought.
 Put some thought into that one.
 Consider that.
 Yeah, man. Give that some thought. In the meantime, you wanna get shit-faced, bro. So I tell you what. Before we get crazy giving away our money here what do you say we buy a couple of pitchers maybe a few tequila shots, a few rounds of kamikazes. After that, we'll hit the town, we'll tie on a serious buzz. All right, bud? Oh, my God! You poor baby. What happened? Uh, my best friend ran me over with his car. Yeah.
 Oh, my God! That's terrible!
 Yeah, yeah.
 Do you want a lap dance?
 Oh
 I don't have any money.
 Oh! I could give you one for free. Really? Okay. Okay. Oh, my God! You poor baby. What happened to you?
 His friend ran him over with a car.
 That is so sad. I know. I was gonna give him a free lap dance.
 She totally was.
 I'll join you! That's great! Do one of you girls wanna hook my boy up over here?
 He's really down in the dumps.
 Okay!
 No, no, no. I don't I don't
 Oh, come on, buddy!
 You gotta do this, man!
 Embrace it. Get in the spirit. This is gonna cheer you up. Well, maybe just one. All right, Frank! See? That's the spirit that beat theJapanese! God. Stupid Dad! Never gave me a goddamn thing. Give his shit to poor people. Poor people? Ooh! Ooh! Oh! Oh. Dee, you scared the shit out of me. What are you doing? Same thing you're doing, Dennis. I'm not letting Dad give all this shit to poor people. I got here first though. I'm taking the plasma TV and the fish tank.
 How come you get to pick and choose?
 It's not that. I'm a man and I'm strong. I can carry heavy things. You're a woman. You're weak, and you can't.
 You're a woman and you're weak.
 That doesn't make any sense.
 You don't make any sense.
 Great. I'll tell you what. Um, I'm gonna take all the stuff that I want and load it into my enormous S. U. V and you can grab some trinkets or whatever and throw it in your tiny little car. All right, look. We don't need to be doing this, okay? You're my brother. We're We're in this thing together. We don't need to make this a competition. Yeah. You're right. A competition. That's a good idea. I'll make you a deal. Whatever your feeble little arms can carry out of here, you can keep. And the rest is mine. God, I hate you so bad!
 Okay, you ready?
 Yeah! On your mark! Get set! Go!
 Go, go, go!
 Go, horsey! Come on! Come on! No! Wait a second! Charlie, you hit me!
 You hit me, Charlie!
 So what? So what?
 You are fast.
 I was winning anyway. This one's too heavy! This one's too heavy!
 You are freakishly fast!
 Thanks. Charlie, you got any booze in here? Yeah, yeah. Check under my bed or under one of my pillows. Hey, guys, I can't thank you enough. I feel so much better. So much. Yeah, man. Hey, you look great. Make yourself at home.
 Charlie, we gotta get him out of here.
 What? Why, dude? Because there's two of them and three of us! Have a heart. The guy's going through a divorce.
 Since when do you give a shit about people?
 Well, you know. Maybe you should be the one that leaves, okay? Don't you roll away when I'm talking to you.
 I am the reason the girls are here in the first place.
 That is bullshit!
 Do not ruin this! Do not ruin this for me!
 I'm not ruining anything! Whoa! What are you guys fighting about? Nothing, man. We're just having a Well, take it out in the hall. You're ruining the vibe.
 Okay. We'll go out in the hall. Watch my Watch my
 Shut up! Easy. Easy! Your behavior is unbelievable, man.
 All right. How are we gonna do this?
 Okay.
 Uh, let's flip a coin. The loser leaves.
 Great.
 Okay, get a coin.
 I don't have a coin.
 Why don't you
 Give me a coin. You have a coin?
 Of course I don't have a coin.
 All right.
 Let's flip something else.
 All right. Um
 Something in the hallway, like a feather.
 Flip that, uh, piece of wood?
 That's not gonna work.
 What about something off the chair? Yeah. Maybe we'll just break something off the chair. Break something Don't Don't break it too much.
 No, that's not gonna work.
 It's a rental, dude.
 You know what? Frank's got money. Let's ask him.
 All right.
 It's locked.
 No. You gotta push it hard 'cause it sticks.
 I'm telling you, it's locked.
 Bang again!
 Frank!
 Frank, open the door, dude!
 Hey.
 Oh. You guys need to give me about Here. Hey, Charlie, here's five dollars. Go down to Wawa, pick me up a couple of sodas. I got a feeling I'll be pretty thirsty after this. Yeah. Hey Oh Son of a bitch. Over the line. Over the line!
 I'm I'm on the line.
 On the line is over the line. Get your foot on your side. Which side? This one? Is this the side?
 No.
 This the side you're talking about? Get All right. You know what? Oh, what is this? Do you recognize this lamp?
 Where'd you get that?
 I think this is the lamp Dad got you in China.
 Give it back to me.
 As I recall, yeah.
 Give me my lamp back.
 Must have gotten this out of your room.
 Well, it's mine.
 Let me put it on your side for you.
 You s
 Oh, that is a shame.
 No, that's fine. I don't care.
 It slipped. Yeah. By the way, I wanted to show you something my feeble little arms were able to carry. By all means.
 Mr. Tibbs.
 Oh, is that it? Is that Mr. Tib Is that what they call you? They call you Mr. Tibbs?
 What do they call you now?
 Whatever. I don't care. Hey-o! What's up, bitches?
 What?
 Dennis, you would not believe how great this thing is. People give you free shit, and women treat you like a puppy they found out on the street.
 Really?
 Yeah. Dude, I was thinking. You pick up one of these bad boys, we head down to the mall. There's a ton of talent down there. We've been looking for a new angle.
 That does sound like fun.
 Yeah. Yeah, that'll work. Oh, I'm sorry, Dee. We're putting ourselves into the shoes of the unfortunate see what their world's like, maybe gain a little perspective.
 What do you do?
 I don't take advantage of people.
 Oh!
 Look at Sweet Dee sitting on her cloud of judgment handing down life lessons to all the sinners. Come on, Mac. Let's go get crippled. Charlie.
 Charlie, buddy, buddy, buddy. Charlie.
 Oh, my God, I'm cold.
 We gotta talk, Charlie.
 Uh Oh, yeah, Frank. We have to talk. Last night was one of the greatest nights of my whole life.
 I'm sure it was.
 I used to live like this in squalor and filth always trying to get over on people, scamming my way through situations.
 Wow! I don't care!
 I wanna live like you again, Charlie. I wanna be pathetic and desperate and ugly and hopeless.
 I am not ugly.
 This is the change I've been looking for.
 I wanna move in with you.
 Are you out Are you out of your damn mind, dude? You made me sleep out in the hall. You ignored my cries for help in the middle of the night.
 I'll pay for your rent for six months.
 Twelve.
 Six.
 Ten.
 Six.
 Nine.
 Six.
 Ten.
 Six.
 Twelve.
 Four.
 Six.
 Deal.
 All right.
 No more sleeping out in the hall though.
 I can't promise that.
 Let's get ready.
 All right. Where are you taking me?
 We're going back to the strip club.
 All right. Strip club
 Dude! My legs!
 Hold on a second. This is going to be like shooting fish in a barrel for us. It's gonna be awesome. What's your backstory?
 What do you mean?
 Bro, your backstory. How'd your legs get crippled?
 I don't know.
 All right, check mine out. I had polio. Okay? That's why I'm rocking the F. D. R. Look with the blanket and everything. See, I got a problem. My legs are really muscular and athletic. So nobody's gonna believe that they're dead. Okay? This way, with the blanket, everyone will assume that underneath my legs are withered and useless.
 Huh. That's a good idea.
 Bro, it's brilliant. Yeah. I have polio too. You can't have polio. That's my disease. You gotta pick your own disease.
 Yeah, but I want polio.
 Well, you can't have it. What the hell is this? Are you sure you're okay? It's really important that I do this myself. You are so brave. I got it! All by myself, I did it. Yeah, you did. That's awesome. Goddamn it. What are we gonna do now? We can't go back in there. Everybody's desensitized. All right, look. We'll go down to Crate and Barrel.
 Maybe we can find some cougars or something.
 Hey, guys! Shit! What do we do? What do we do?
 Uh, okay. Just play it cool, man.
 Play it cool. Play it cool.
 Hey.
 Hey.
 How's it going?
 I have polio. Oh. Uh Okay.
 And I have polio
 He has polio too. Mm-hmm. All right. Um
 So if you wanna shower, you gotta shower in the bar.
 Shower in the bar?
 Yeah. Shower in the sink.
 In the sink? Yeah. You never showered in a sink bef Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
 What?
 Oh, my God!
 Do you see that?
 What? I got a good idea. I think I know how we can really up our game at the strip club. How? Who gets more respect and admiration in this country than war heroes?
 Athletes.
 Yeah, that's true.
 But after that.
 Rock stars.
 Yeah, also true. But after that, Frank.
 Actors.
 Yeah Right.
 Models.
 Yes. Look
 Rich people. Okay, look, look, look! If you just buy me this costume I'm gonna show these ladies a war hero they can't take their eyes off of. I don't think this costume's gonna work. No, this costume The chicks are gonna go crazy over this. Maybe you should let me do all the talking.
 It's gonna be like fish in a barrel. I got it covered.
 Okay.
 Just watch watch and learn.
 Oh, look at you, sweetie. What happened? Viet-goddamn-nam's what happened! Go get me a beer, bitch!
 Excuse me.
 What are you doing? What are you doing?
 Hey, that was working.
 Let me do the talking.
 I'll take it from here.
 Did you just box me in? You don't do that to a guy, Frank. You don't box in a vet!
 You don't stick a vet in the corner, Frank!
 Sorry about that. He's a little loosey-goosey upstairs. I try to get him out as much as possible. It's very difficult.
 Is he your
 Boy. He's my poor little crippled boy.
 Oh, that's so sad.
 Mmm. I didn't fight no damn war so I could be boxed in by some square commie-ass piece of shit! Well, I feel awful. Well, that's what happens when you meet an actual crippled person.
 Brings you down.
 Yeah, disabled. Whatever, dude. Crippled, disabled I don't care, man!
 I just wanna get out of here. This whole thing's ruined.
 I know! We should, because, you know, you weren't pulling it off anyway. Hold on a second. Don't pull that shit with me, okay?
 I didn't ruin this. You ruined this.
 How did I ruin it? I had a good polio backstory that the chicks were gonna totally dig
 Nobody cares about polio or backstories or
 You know what?
 I bet you a million dollars if I had talked to a girl
 For God's sakes!
 About my withered legs, then
 A million dollars? All right. What are we doing? What are we doing? I think that there's only one true way to settle this like gentlemen. You're dead! Hey! No! No!
 Oh, yeah, baby!
 You cheated! You cheated! Oh, yeah! Whoo!
 You suck!
 All you do is cheat! How do you feel about that, huh?
 How do you feel about that?
 What are you doing? You're just a sore loser! What's going on down there? Those two guys are pretending to be disabled and kicking each other's asses. What a bunch of scumbags.
 Being handicapped sucks, dude.
 Oh, yeah, man. It's too much work.
 There's, like, nothing to show for it, man.
 There's no advantages.
 Oh, look at this guy. Hey.
 Another homeless guy?
 Hey, buddy.
 Hey, pal, wake up.
 Hey.
 Charlie?
 What the hell are you doing?
 What time is it?
 Why are you dressed like that, dude?
 Yeah. What is going on? Why are you sleeping out here? Because I can't sleep in there! I can't get onto the stupid curb! Why would you wanna sleep in there? Your dad keeps swooping in, taking my chicks and locking me out of my apartment! Okay. Well, we were gonna go inside and get drunk. You wanna come with us? No. Look at me. I got a whole thing going on, man.
 What Really?
 Yeah. I'm going to the strip Don't touch that.
 I'm going to the strip club. I'm gonna get some girls
 With this? I mean Yeah, with this! I mean, the whole thing is This is good as gold. Frank keeps coming in. He swoops in, he takes my chicks. He doesn't care about me. What kind of a guy does that? Who comes into someone's apartment and just kicks him out? Like I'm a piece of crap. Like I belong on the street. Like I'm some kind of piece of dirt. That's bullshit, man! War hero coming through. How you doing? War hero. So kind of a big deal. I'm a war hero. How do you Hey, how you doin'? I'm a war hero. So I'll catch up with you. All right. Okay. All right. Hey, war hero. So All right. All right. Maybe hit the gym a little bit. What the hell? Yeah! No! No! No! Charlie! Hey, this is my roommate, Charlie.
 Girls, say hello to Charlie.
 No!
 Hi, Charlie!
 No! No! No! No! No! No, Frank! Come here! Come here!
 What What is this shit?
 Well, it's just I rigged it up. It's like I'm really using my hands, but they don't know it. No, Frank! What are you doing with the strippers? You're stealing my thing! What? Well, I figured, you know, I'd cut out the middleman. This way, everybody wins. I don't win. The other thing I figured out is the only thing that attracts the attention of strippers more than pity is money. And I brought a shitload of that.
 What Charlie!
 I'm gonna kill you!
 You're totally blowing up my scene here, man!
 Are you crazy? This is the best thing that ever happened to me, and you're ruining it!
 It's a win-win situation.
 No! You come to my apartment! You lock me out! Take all my girls! It's not a win-win situation!
 My thumb's on your neck.
 Why can't you just give me this?
 I'm gonna kill you.
 This guy's a walker! But I love the guy, all right? He's family, you know? I mean, we've been through a lot together. Okay? So, you know, is it wrong for me to love him? I don't know. If I have to listen to you talk about this stupid goddamned stuffed elephant anymore I'm going to punch you in the head. Hey! Mr. Tibbs was not just some stupid stuffed element elephant, okay?
 He was like a companion.
 Strip club!
 All right. Let's go
 Strip club! Yeah. Let's go to the strip club. You're driving. All right. You know, I didn't realize that somebody in your condition could have so much energy.
 Well, you gotta live, right?
 God! You know, you you are an amazing person. I'm scoring in there, and you come in there and blow everything!
 You shouldn't even be in there!
 You get your hands off my blow tube! Go get your goddamn car and give me a ride home!
 I'll give you a ride home!
 Hey! Ow, my legs! Oh, my legs! Frank, what are you doing?
 Hey, Dad!
 My broken legs! Why are you beating up a homeless person? What the hell's with the crutches? It's kind of a It's kind of a long story.
 I can't really go into it right now.
 Oh, yeah?
 Whether you like it or not Here! How about that?
 Hey! Give Whoo! That's right! We're going to the strip club! I'm gonna steal Charlie's girls at the strip club! I'm gonna buy you a lap dance. I'm gonna buy myself a lap dance. I'm gonna buy everybody at the whole strip club a lap dance.
 Whoa! Are you people all pretending to be handicapped?
 Mind your own business.
 Give me the crutches back. Dad!
 No!
 Who's acting like a child? You just stole my stuff!
 You are acting like a child!
 Oh! Whoo!
 Whoo, baby!
 I'm gonna count to three. If you don't put those god
 You don't get the crutches.
 1,002
 Here's the crutches.
 Give me the
 You can't have 'em! Oh, shit! Paging Dr. Lyon. Dr. Lyon, please report to the emergency room. We are so lucky that nobody got killed.
 Oh, my God.
 Well, yeah. Actually, Dennis is lucky that nobody got killed since he's the guy that just about killed everybody.
 You know what? Maybe you killed somebody.
 How does that make sense?
 Maybe you did kill somebody!
 Maybe you standing in front of a driving car
 Yeah, well, driving a vehicle
 Shut up! Will you shut up, for crying out loud! Don't youse ever stop fighting and just shut the hell up?
 Now, who wants ice cream?
 I do.
 Really, Dad?
 Enjoy a nice ice cream and just thank goodness that nobody important got seriously hurt. What a bunch of assholes.                     I just need to get some leverage here.
 Okay. Just pull.
 I'm tryin'to pull it, dude.
 Pull harder, Dennis.
 If I pull harder
 it's gonna dig into his leg.
 Don't yell at me.
 I need to jam the shears farther down
 Jam 'em in there!
 Pull harder, and I will!
 Dude, you should get a doctor to do this. Oh, look at me! The millionaire who goes to see doctors!
 Come on. Just pull the damn crowbar
 Okeydokey. Charlie, you want
 You want the cast off?
 That's what you wanted. That's what you were asking for. Just soak it in hot water, and it gets soft and it peels right off
 piece by piece.
 What do you know about anything?
 What are you even doing here?
 Why are you still here?
 Just want to be part of the gang.
 You're not part of our gang. You're not part of the gang either, Dee, so forget that.
 Yes, I am.
 You're not. The gang is me, Mac and Charlie. That's the gang.
 Dennis, let your sister be part of the gang.
 She can't be part of the gang.
 Why would you say that?
 Is she part of the gang?
 What gang?
 I have no idea what you're talking about.
 Come on! Pull on it!
 Hello. Excuse me. I'm looking for the owner.
 Yeah, that's us.
 We're the owners. My name is Ari Frenkel. I just bought the building next door.
 Oh!
 Great, man. That's awesome. I purchased it a few months ago, but I was just able to move my family into Philadelphia.
 Ah, yeah. Where from?
 Israel. Just got to be too dangerous you know, with everything that's happening.
 Well, that's a tough situation you got over there.
 You got that whole tsunami
 No?
 Well, the Superdome thing that
 Charlie.
 No, there's no Superdome.
 It's one of those places over there.
 It's a different country.
 Why don't you shut up?
 Never mind. I had a Anyway, I just Yeah, it's all good.
 Stopped over to give you this.
 What is this?
 It's a notice to vacate.
 What? Yeah, according to the zoning grid, the piece of property that I purchased extends exactly 100 feet to the north. Anything south of that dividing line belongs to me.
 Well, where's the dividing line?
 Mmm, right about here.
 What?
 Bullshit!
 Gonna need you outta here in a week.
 You can't do that.
 Dad, stay out of this. We can handle it, all right?
 L-Look-Look, man!
 I don't know how you guys do things in What was it?
 Israel.
 Israel.
 Israel or whatever, but this is America! You can't just come in here and steal our land from us. I'm I'm pretty sure that's how this country was founded in the first place. What are you saying? You're making things up now. I don't know what that means. Does anybody know what If you're talkin' shit about America, we are gonna kick your ass.
 I'm sure you will.
 This is our bar. Your bar is on my land. Good-bye, gentlemen. What are we gonna do? This guy comes He really gets my goat. You know what I mean? You shouldn't be allowed to come in, tell people, "Hey, I own this. I own that." Okay, the butter goes on, then the peanut butter.
 Hmm? What are you doing?
 Peanut butter go in the middle?
 With the choc
 Don't Do not put peanut butter on that!
 What?
 A grilled Charlie has peanut butter last.
 Okay, either inside or outside.
 Peanut butter outside.
 Chocolate inside.
 All right. Butter inside. Cheese outside.
 Go away.
 Frank, it's me. Open the door.
 Oh, shit. It's my wife.
 Okay Okay, man, we talked about this, right? We knew this day would come. Okay? We got to face it. We got Okay, okay.
 Breathe.
 Yeah. Let it out. Say "I can do this."
 I can do this.
 All right. Go answer the door.
 No, no, no. You answer the door. I don't want to get smacked.
 I'm not Okay, look Where are your balls, dude? Where are your balls? Okay? You're a grown man. Think about your balls. Where are your balls? Start swinging
 Charlie, don't talk about my balls.
 Open this door! I can't even mention your balls around you. Okay.
 Charlie, she's all hopped up on amphetamines.
 Well, okay.
 I'll get your back, and
 I can hear it in her voice.
 Look, if you don't do this now, you're never
 Frank, open the goddamn door
 before I put my foot through it!
 Just do it. Just deal with the bitch.
 Hey, Barbara.
 Don't you "Hey, Barbara" me. Jesus Christ, Frank. This place is a shit hole! Is this how you've been living?
 We make it work. What do you want?
 I want to talk. I tried to talk to you weeks ago. You went on vacation. I was trying to scare some sense into you. You were talking about giving away all of our money. My money. I made it, you spent it. Burn. There you go, buddy. How can you say that to me? After everything I've done for you. While you were out making money, who do you think was at home cooking and cleaning and raising your children? A series of Mexican women. A series Unbelievable, dude. You're on fire. You can choose to live like an animal if you want to but I refuse to be subjected to it. I want my shit back. You took my shit from our home, and I want it back.
 I didn't take anything.
 It's empty. Someone came in and took everything. Maybe you should have somebody deported like you used to in the old days. Beautiful. Oh! Oh! I can't even talk to you anymore. Standing up for yourself. Standing up for immigrants! I don't know what you're turning into, Frank, but it's making me sick!
 Stings, doesn't it?
 Yeah. It hurts really bad. Yeah. You got a little hand mark.
 Dude, you're burning! You're burning!
 Ooh, shit!
 All right, all right. With the peanut butter
 You have ruined this one!
 No, no. Put the peanut butter on
 You ruined that one. Apparently, Mr. Frenkel is citing a zoning grid
 that was created by the original city planners.
 Wait. So this asshole's using a law that's, like, 300 years old?
 That's bullshit!
 Yeah. You can't do that. You guys had an opportunity to buy the land at the time of the original purchase.
 You declined.
 So what? You also had a second opportunity when the fiscal quarter
 Let's not get into the blame game here, man.
 Solutions. Yeah, let's talk solutions. How do we get this guy out of our bar? Unfortunately, it doesn't seem as though you guys have any legal recourse. We don't have any legal recourse. No. All right. I think I follow, fellas. All right. We don't have any Legal recourse. What you're saying is, uh, we got to get creative. If you're implying that I'm advising you to do anything illegal then I'm afraid you're mistaken.
 No, of course we're mistaken.
 No, no, no. Yeah, no. We're mistaken. No, we would never want to implicate certain parties
 in certain matters, but
 No. But if certain parties who has, uh, certain experiences
 Or connections.
 Certain affiliations. Uh, affiliations, uh, could give us some tips or pointers or even, you know, connect us to one of his guys we could really, uh
 Get out.
 Okay. I think the lawyer's right. We gotta send this guy some kind of message. It's time to take action, but we should be careful. I don't want to come off as anti-Semitic. This guy's a Jewish person
 What's that have to do with anything?
 Yeah. We don't have a problem with Jews. It's this guy in particular. Jewish, okay? He's Jewish. Don't use the word "Jew."
 I don't appreciate that.
 Nah, that's okay.
 That is a racial slur, Charlie, and
 Calling somebody a Jew
 who is a Jew is not a racial slur.
 Please stop. No. Will you please not use the word "Jew"? It makes me uncomfortable.
 It's not anti-Semitic.
 It's about the context. If you use the right context
 you're good.
 You're the most misinformed person I've ever met.
 You don't even know what's going on in Israel.
 Okay. That's right. You don't know what's going on in Israel.
 Maybe you shouldn't be speaking on the subject.
 Are you guys serious?
 Maybe you should leave it to me.
 Do you know what's happening in Israel?
 Of course, bro. I read the newspaper.
 Okay. Well, you know what? Why don't you crack an egg of knowledge all over me, buddy?
 Okay. Can I start?
 Yeah.
 Well, okay. There's a war on terror, Charlie.
 Mm-hmm.
 Have you ever seen CNN?
 Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
 Okay. George Bush right now
 Well, start from the beginning.
 Saddam Hussein has the oil.
 Yeah.
 Okay?
 Okay.
 Charlie, it is a war on terror.
 We have decided to help the people of Israel
 To give our oil back to us
 By defeating Saddam Hussein.
 My head is, like, swelling with knowledge.
 It's freedom, Charlie.
 With wonderful knowledge.
 You're being sarcastic
 when we're talking about our
 Oh! Oh! You can't hide from it forever.
 You're an idiot.
 You're an idiot. Here you go. Stupid customers. It smells like urine in here. Mama, you're back. I'm not gonna get scurvy if I come any further, am I?
 How are you?
 I'll tell you how I am, Deandra. I am devastated. I don't understand what is going on with your father. And I What the hell is this?
 What? Oh!
 Are those my earrings? Oh Y-Yea Yeah. But here's the thing about the earrings You're stealing from your mother now? What kind of monster are you? Dad said he was gonna give all your stuff away, and then it was actually Dennis's idea Don't blame this on your brother. How low can you sink, Deandra? I haven't seen you for a month, and I'm standing here in a neck brace. Are you gonna ask how I'm doing or what happened or I assume you did something stupid.
 Dennis ran over me with his car.
 There you go again! Don't you think it's about time you start taking responsibility for your actions?
 L
 I want my possessions returned. I was eating that, Mother. I've been running around. I haven't had time to feed the dog. Could you stop thinking about yourself for once? And besides, you don't need it, sweetie. Well, that's attractive. Maybe if you took a bit more pride in your appearance you could find a man, and then you wouldn't have to steal from your mother! I mean, look at your skin, Deandra. Christ, there is a sun in Philadelphia. He's already got a construction crew in there working? Oh, God, dude. I am sick of staring at this building, guys.
 We gotta take some action.
 Okay, okay. I'll tell you what. Let's throw a flaming bag of poop in the window. What? Why? Because they stamp it out and they get poop all over their shoes. What in the hell is that going to accomplish? Poop on their shoes. Their shoes, dude.
 Sh
 Are you retarded?
 Poop on the shoes.
 Are you a retarded person?
 Poop on the shoes, man.
 I've got it.
 You do?
 Yeah. Let's come back tonight. I got a plan. Ah, yeah. This ought to do it. Yeah. Okay, so what's the next step? There is no next step. This is it.
 This is it?
 Yeah.
 This is your plan?
 It's awesome. This isn't gonna do shit!
 What do you mean this isn't gonna do shit?
 There needs to be a next step! Do you know how hard it is to get toilet paper off a building, especially if it rains? This Jew's in for a ton of work.
 Oh!
 Whoa. What? Come on, man. You can't say things like that.
 What did I say?
 You dropped a hard "J" on us.
 Jew? You guys said it
 Shh! You can say it, but it has to be in the right context.
 You guys said I could say "Jew."
 You can, but in the right context.
 Well, what is the right context?
 All right.
 Well, this, you know
 Person of theJewish faith
 Right. Yeah.
 In a group of other people from theJewish faith
 Then I said
 This guy's got a ton of work to do!
 I think it's okay that he's Jewish.
 That is not what I'm That's not what he's Okay. Hold on a second You guys don't know what the hell you're talking about. This man is in for a ton of work. He's Jewish. We know what we're talking about. Don't worry about that. Yeah. Hello, Frank. I noticed you changed the locks on the door. You didn't have to do that because I'm never coming back here again. I'm looking forward to that. You seem happy. I think I'm feeling satisfied for the first time in my life. What is that, musk? That's my new friend. I met him outside of that disgusting bar our children own. That's his Mercedes across the street. His wife's dead. Good-bye, Frank. Hey! You! What are you doing here with my wife? Soon to be ex-wife. I'm not doing anything. She invited me over for coffee. Are you bangin' him? You bangin' this guy? Not yet, but I'm giving it serious consideration. Is there some problem here? Adultery that's what this is. That's it. Animal! Sorry about that. He used to beat me, you know.
 Change of plans.
 What happened?
 Your mother seems happy.
 Shit! I just can't have that, Dee. Well, what do you want to do? What's the one thing your mother loves more than anything in this world?
 That teeny, tiny little dog.
 Let's go steal it.
 What are you doing?
 Go get the dog, Deandra! What are you doing with your hands? What does that mean?
 What's all this?
 Dog. Kitchen. That's "kitchen"? Why can't you go get the dog?
 Because I got a cast on my foot.
 I got a neck brace. Deandra, I'm your father. Go in and get the dog. You mean the dog? You're out of your mind. Oh. Hello. Please don't bite me. Okay. Do not bite me. Here we go. Nothing weird is going on. Shit! Run! Run! Gentlemen, I've got something here that's gonna send our friend on the first train back to Israel.
 Eggs?
 Yeah. These eggs are organic. They're, like, three times the size of normal eggs and twice the price. If this doesn't show this guy we mean business, nothing's gonna.
 I'm in.
 Okay.
 Whoa. What are you talking about, you're in?
 Hey, it's something, Mac. Oh, it's something. Let's just do something. I wonder how long it took him to get that toilet paper down. Didn't even notice the toilet paper. What? Where does What the hell is this? He put up a fence.
 He didn't notice the toilet paper? He put up a fence.
 He walled us in.
 He walled us in!
 Where does it end and where does it begin?
 This guy's good.
 Okay. This guy wants to get extreme? Let's get extreme. Screw the eggs.
 How far does this thing go?
 Back to the bar. Plan "B."
 It's locked. You guys have your keys?
 Go around front.
 Go, go, go.
 Fine. Fine. Fine.
 Wait. Hold on. It gets thinner.
 Squeeze through there. It gets thinner, Dennis! Wait! Don't push me!
 Wait, wait, wait! My toe's caught in the fence!
 Go back!
 That's fine. Just go back. Just go back.
 I can't move! I can't
 Come on! You guys gotta go!
 Stop yelling!
 Stop yelling!
 Go over! Go over! I'll lift you. Don't climb! Don't climb, Dennis!
 That son of a bitch! He put up a wall!
 Hop over!
 Hop?
 Climb over!
 Happy place!
 Climb over and get help! Oh, this son of a bitch! You son of a bitch! Okay. Now what are we doing, holding it for ransom or something? I haven't thought this all the way through. You haven't thought it through? It destroyed my apartment. Look. We're living in the moment. We're running around stealing things.
 We're doing anything we want.
 Stop talking like that.
 You and I ought to team up on stuff like this more often.
 Oh, no, we shouldn't.
 Oh, yeah. And also
 You're not on my team. I want to team up with Mac, because he seems stupid enough to do anything. Okay, knock it off. You're not teaming up with any of us. Nobody wants you around. Oh God damn it. That doesn't I'm gonna sit here until you use words. That doesn't mean anything. This doesn't mean anything. Your mother might be here, so take the dog into the bedroom.
 That's fine. You take it.
 You take the dog! I'm telling you! Fine. Okay, but this is exactly why you're not part of our gang. God damn it! Where'd it go?
 What the hell do you want?
 Your wife says she's afraid of you.
 I'm here for the dog.
 Ooh! That woman is amazing. She is amazing. You just met her. She's already got you running errands for her. She's good. She is good.
 Just go get the dog.
 I don't have the dog. So you've been in here tearing apart pillows and pooping on the floor? Yes. I'm starting to lose patience with you people. I've already had to deal with your son and his retarded friends. My contractor just told me there's a gas leak in that goddamn building I just bought. The whole thing is becoming a big pain in my ass. Go get the dog. I have a little business proposition I want to talk to you about out in the hallway. You guys feeling extreme? Ah, this looks beautiful.
 Okay. You guys ready for this?
 I'm ready. I'm ready. Let's do this. Okay, okay, okay. And action. Cut, cut, cut, cut! What the hell are you doing, dude? That's what those tapes sound like. Why don't you read the script I wrote? I'm not reading the script. It's in English and riddled with spelling errors. You know what I'm trying to write. Say it. I'm gonna mumble guttural sounds. Let's do another one.
 He's not gonna know what you're saying! I feel like I should have something in my hands.
 You don't need anything in your hands.
 Like a weapon.
 A machete or a machine gun.
 Why don't you head down to the Wawa and pick up a machine gun?
 Read the script.
 I'm not gonna read the script.
 Who's the director here?
 I don't care. I'm not reading the script.
 Fine. Action!
 Bro, can I get my towel over my face again?
 Put your towel on your face.
 Here we go. Action!
 I'm gonna get a weapon!
 You don't need a He's gonna go get a weapon, everybody! Everybody! Everybody get a weapon! Can we You think we can make this look more like a cave? You not make restaurant here. Bad decision. We will crush your skull with our weapons!
 We can't send this.
 Nope.
 What are you guys talking about?
 We're gonna get arrested. Yeah, or murdered. This is a little too extreme, Charlie.
 Man, I feel sick.
 Me too. What, you think I don't feel sick? Okay. I'm sick. I feel very sick, but I directed the shit out of this video.
 This stuff is gold.
 You're not the one on TV dressed like a terrorist threatening Jews, Charlie.
 Oh, Mac
 That context was fine, Dennis. Trust me. I was thinking about it when we were watching the video. All right. Okay. What are we supposed to do then? Can I throw a bag of poop through the window? Yes. I have better aim than you. I should throw the bag of poop. Dude, I sat over the bag for 20 minutes. I'm throwing it.
 Hey, guys.
 Hey, Dee.
 What are you doing?
 We're gonna throw this bag of poop through this guy's window.
 You wanna come? Yeah.
 Mm-hmm. Hey, there's no one even in there! Well, just throw the bag in anyway, dude. Yeah, but no one's gonna get poop on their shoes! Just throw the damn bag, Charlie.
 All right! Oh!
 Why are we doing this?
 We're gonna teach this guy a lesson.
 Awesome. This is gonna be great. It's gonna smell so bad in there. I just hope he gets the message. Uh, I think this is the wrong message. Yeah. All right, so this here is the pillar that I want to remove. I want to get this out of here so there's a nice wide open space
 when people walk into the bar.
 What are you doing, Dad? In a second, Dennis. And, uh, go into the bathroom. Check out the fixtures. I'll be in in a second.
 What the hell's going on?
 He's renovating my bar.
 Your bar?
 Yeah, my bar. You see, the property that I just purchased extends from Morgan Street all the way to right here. What the hell are you talking about? The property you bought? The building you blew up. The building you set on fire. What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out about that? Hmm! I'll give you two choices. I'm part of the gang or I send your asses to jail.
 I would rather go to jail than work with you.
 Yes! Just for the record, I would rather not spend my life in jail.
 I will tear this bar to the ground.
 I will kick the pillars in!
 Nobody's kicking anything.
 She will kick the pillars!
 I will tear
 Okay, here's what we're gonna do! Everyone, relax. Frank, congratulations. You're captain of the gang.
 No! Charlie
 Charlie, shut your mouth! Why can't you just die and leave your money to your kids like normal parents of America?
 You sound like your mother.
 You say that to my face!
 Excuse me.
 I will kick and tear Excuse me! Thank you. We're looking for the owners. Oh. We're the owners. I'm Detective Tanner. This here is Detective Volpe. Gentlemen, we're gonna have to talk to you for a moment. About what? You gentlemen know anything about this? Uh Oh shit.                    
 Dennis, stop acting like a child.
 I don't want to hear it, Dad. Deandra, move the pool table so you and your brother can lay some grout. I am not laying grout.
 You guys are being babies.
 Babies. We're being babies, Mac? Why don't you go work for your dad all day?
 My dad's a meth dealer.
 Oh, oh, no!
 My daddy's in prison!
 My daddy used to give hot shots to prostitutes.
 Feel sorry for me!
 I got the grout.
 Dad, you're not even listening to us.
 Are you really leaving?
 Yes!
 Later, bitches.
 Yeah, have a good life now.
 All right, look. I know what you're doin'. I can play this game. Mac and me and Charlie can run the bar.
 Great. Terrific. Good idea.
 Great. We got better things to do. Please. What are you two gonna do? Dee and I have a little something we like to call "goals."
 Weird, right?
 We have aspirations outside of this bar. We got big dreams, Mac. We're gonna go follow 'em. You guys have nothing without this bar. Don't worry about us, Mac. We'll be just fine.
 So what are your dreams?
 Hmm?
 Your goals. What are your aspirations?
 Were you serious about that? Yeah! What are you doing?
 Signing us up for unemployment benefits.
 Unemployment? No. Dee, that's for deadbeats. Come on. We got a golden opportunity here. You know? We can do anything we want if we put our minds to it. Well, I guess I could use this time to get my acting career off the ground.
 And I fully support you.
 You do? Absolute The old Dennis would have said, "Dee, your sad little acting ship sailed a decade ago. It's pathetic." But the new Dennis says that it's not my place to kill your pipe dreams.
 You should go for it.
 Really? Yes! Come on. This is America! We're gonna go for it! We're gonna work hard! We're gonna reach for the stars! We're gonna become more successful than our parents.
 We can shove it in their faces.
 Make 'em eat shit! Oh, look, we qualified.
 Really? How much?
 400 a week.
 400 That's more than we made at the bar.
 I know. Okay, new plan.
 We're gonna go on unemployment.
 Yeah.
 That's what it's there for, right?
 In the meantime we will focus and work hard and keep our nose to the grindstone. Right? Absolutely.
 Ready?
 Yeah. One, two, three.
 Goddamn it!
 Wha Why can you not lift your end?
 I don't know, dude. Let me figure out what is happening.
 Are you lifting with your back? Of course I'm lifting with my back. I think your end is lighter. The balls have rolled down to this end. No! You got to snap your back up and lift.
 I'm jerking my back up! What do you want from me?
 Hey, what's the ruckus? I'm trying to conduct important business back there. We finished with the tile. Now we're trying to move the pool table back. All right, all right, all right. Have you done the urinal? Because the urinal, you flush it, and it sprays all over the place.
 Yeah, I know.
 Look, bro. You gotta stop bossing us around, okay? I mean, look at Charlie. You're breaking his spirit. Look at me. I'm broken, dude. Look, I'm You guys need a father figure. And I'm trying to be that father figure and someday you're gonna thank me for it. And that's all there is to it. Trust me. Trust me on that one. You're gonna thank me for it. I don't want a father figure. Come down just a little bit. He's not hitting it that high, you know? Now you should split the difference.
 You got to split the difference.
 Yeah, split the difference. What the hell is this? Oh, living the dream, bro. Living the dream. I thought you two were out looking for careers or something. We are. We're just getting a little bit of assistance to help us out over the hump. And this unemployment thing is so great, because we've made really big plans.
 I'm gonna be a veterinarian.
 Yeah.
 And I am gonna move to New York, and I'm gonna be on Broadway.
 Mm-hmm. What? It's 1:00 in the afternoon, and you're piss-ass drunk. Well, it's a slow process, man. It takes a little time. But we trust the system.
 Is that a new watch, dude?
 It is. It's awesome.
 And I got a Jesus chain.
 It's good. Look at it. All right, look, guys. We want you to come back to the bar, okay?
 Why in the hell would we do that?
 You're not even listening to me.
 Did you see myJesus chain?
 I'm busting my ass in that bar and you guys are sitting on the stoop getting drunk all day long? What, this again? What, this again?
 I have to work!
 Cry for me. Cry for me. I don't know how to take advantage of government programs. Unemployment runs out. And once it does, you guys are gonna be back out on your asses.
 Once it runs out, we're gonna go on welfare, dude.
 Yup.
 Welfare?
 Mm-hmm.
 You guys can't go on welfare.
 Oh, really? It's reserved for people who need it, you know? Like poor people who need some help thr It's set up to continue It's not for overprivileged pieces of shit who want to waste millions of dollars in tax You want to play this game? We gonna play this game now? Goddamn you! Goddamn it! Charlie, sign here, here and here. So, you're giving me all your money. Charlie, for the 500th time, I'm not giving it to you. It's not yours. I'm just setting up a temporary account in your name. What my wife can't find, she can't get. Right. This is good. This is shady, Frank. I like this kind of stuff. But you will be handsomely rewarded if you just keep your hands off this money. Right, right. So what's the vig?
 The vig?
 Yeah, man. You know, what's what's the vig on this action here? Do you even know what "vig" means? Hey-ohh! What's up, bitches?
 Get your gloves. I got a lot of grout work for you to do.
 Forget the grout. I have been doing a little research that will change our lives forever. Turns out there's a little program called Work for Welfare in which businesses hire potential welfare recipients the government subsidizes their wage and the I.R.S. Affords thousands of dollars in tax relief. Oh, I don't know what you're saying. Dude, is that a question? I don't understand. What's going on? Don't you get it? We will never need Dennis and Dee again. We hire a couple people, pay them nothing, and get them to do all of our work for us!
 We just pay them nothing?
 We pay them nothing!
 That's incredible.
 It's incredible!
 What do you think, Frank?
 Well, if we're gonna do something like this
 we got to make sure we don't abuse anybody.
 No. Oh, my God! I know what it's like to grow up poor. We got to treat people with respect. Respect is the name of the game. Respect is number one!
 It's the name of almost every game.
 Absolutely.
 Because we understand the plight of the worker.
 The plight!
 Respect.
 Respect the plight. What do you think, Frank? I'm good. Go get us some slaves. No, dude. That's not what I'm saying.
 All I'm saying is that "slaves" is not a racist term.
 Shh! Look, dude, I'm Okay, look. I'm saying over the history of time, right? There have been slaves of many different races. There's been Jewish slaves.
 I mean, uh, Italian, uh
 I recognize that, Charlie. But in this country, we have to understand that it is a sensitive issue, okay?
 I understand that.
 What about that one? He seems strong.
 Look at those massive thighs.
 Yeah, those are good thighs.
 But you're gonna have a problem with work ethic.
 That's what I'm talking about.
 You can't be saying things like that.
 No, dude.
 I'm not saying that because he's black. He's asleep in his chair.
 That's true.
 What about that one?
 Don't just do that.
 Why not?
 I knew you were gonna do that. Why are you going to him? That's like reverse affirmative action, dude. You don't want to do that. You could cheat yourself out of a good slave here.
 Well, how do you know he's not gonna be a good slave?
 Come on. You know what? This is so complicated and confusing. I don't even understand.
 Let's look at this guy.
 We got to talk to someone. Let's just talk to someone. Hello. Hi. We are here to sign up for the Work for Welfare Program. My associate and I were just out on the floor. We're looking for a suitable candidate. But the problem is it's really tough to tell just by eyeballing these people.
 So we were wondering, like, do you have, like, a face book?
 Yeah. Or anything that we can go over, like their physical stats and some kind of numbers
 Excuse me?
 Like weight, power
 Something to just "expediate" the whole process.
 It doesn't work that way. Why don't you read up on some of the program's stipulations?
 Ooh, that's big.
 The face book? No. Rules and Regulations. It's, uh, sort of a legal document.
 Now, is there any way around this?
 Ohh, you're right.
 None whatsoever.
 Okay.
 All right, well
 Thank you for your time.
 We got this, so we'll read it.
 Have a good one.
 I'm not reading that.
 No, I'm not reading this either.
 We'll get Frank to do it.
 Maybe get a slave to do it.
 Look what the cat dragged in.
 Oh, come on.
 Oh, well, look here.
 I see you've decided to steal our welfare idea.
 I can't say I'm surprised.
 We're not stealing your idea, okay? Let's all recognize that this is a little awkward situation between friends at the welfare store.
 Let's go our separate ways, okay?
 You guys can't get welfare!
 Uh, yeah. We can.
 No, you can't! They don't give it to any jackass that walks in here.
 It's reserved for people who need it.
 That's true. Drug addicts, mentally disabled, people with dependents that sort of thing. Mac, we've got it covered, okay? Dee, your bicycle helmet. Later, boners. That is an awesome helmet. What Go! Out! Hello. Hi. Um, I'm a recovering crackhead. This is my retarded sister that I take care of. I'd like some welfare, please. You're a recovering crack addict?
 Yep.
 Mm-hmm. And she's mentally retarded? Oh, most definitely. You have the proper medical paperwork? Medical paperwork? We're gonna need a physician's report to confirm your sister's mental illness and your blood work to confirm your crack addiction. Well, can't you see how retarded she is?
 Lose the helmet, Sis. We can't prove that you're retarded.
 I want that welfare, Dennis.
 I know you do. So do I. No, you don't understand. I got a taste of my dream. I can't go back.
 I got to get to Broadway, and welfare's the key.
 What do you want to do? Oh, they want to play rough? We can play rough. Let's go buy some crack. Okay, thank you. We're all set. Friday, 3:00. Full blood work.
 Okay. We'll just smoke a little bit.
 A little bit. Just enough to get into our system. Then we'll go to the doctor, we'll get all of our paperwork, and we'll get full benefits. Then we'll collect for just a little while until we get settled.
 Then I'll take the MCATs.
 And I'll move to New York. Perfect. Oh, my God!
 Oh, Jesus!
 Ooh, wow, you scared us.
 Oh, not 'cause you're black. No, we're not racist.
 No. God, no.
 It's just that the neighborhood is scary.
 If you were another ethnicity
 You really did pop up.
 But it's a nice neighborhood.
 No, the trees are
 It's the nature of this Roll your window down. Okay.
 What you need?
 Uh, one, please. One what?
 Uh, one rock of crack.
 One crack A crack rock. Is that enough? Is one crack rock enough?
 See, I don't
 How much would you recommend for a first-time user? Tell you what. I'll make you a deal. Two for the price of one.
 Really?
 Oh, that sounds good.
 Oh. Well, that's very nice of you.
 How much? Uh, $200?
 Okay. Uh-huh.
 Sounds reasonable. Great. Okay. Let's see here, uh
 That should be about 200. Thanks for being so kind.
 Mm-hmm. And patient. Pick it up down there.
 Wait. Where?
 Wh-Which This one. It's got to be that guy. Don't say "this one." Now, Maria, after you're done in the bathroom you come look for me because I got some boots to be shined, all right? Tony, go chase that leak down in the basement, all right?
 Okay, boss.
 Okay. Mac, I got to hand it to you. This is brilliant.
 That's how I roll. Charles?
 Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm gonna get nice and drunk, play some video games until my eyes bleed.
 Amen to that, brother.
 Me too. I want to play Charlie.
 Uhh, don't you have, like, some stuff that you need to do?
 Yeah. Yeah.
 No.
 Yeah, managerial stuff.
 Managerial stuff!
 No, I got that all cleared up.
 And then I thought after we played a video game
 Uh-huh. The three of us go outside, throw the pigskin around, play some two-hand touch.
 Ooh, ooh.
 Hey, that's not gonna that's not gonna work out.
 I'll teach you how to play.
 I already know how to play. Not properly though.
 Kind of properly.
 Right. Uh, oh, Charlie. You know what? We got to get into the bathroom to show Maria
 The mixing!
 Charlie has this thing the scrubbing.
 Scrubbing!
 Charlie has this scrubbing thing with the Brillo.
 I have a Brillo.
 He has a method, and we gotta show her.
 And make sure she's got it down.
 All right. I'll get myself a beer.
 Yeah!
 Yeah, get a beer. We'll work it out over here. Well, this is a development I did not expect. It's like he's really trying to become our father.
 I know how to play football, Charlie.
 I know you do, bro.
 I know you do.
 Do you want me to leave? Huh? No, you're good. Just Actually, make sure you really work that sponge in there. Because otherwise, that stain, like, it'll
 It's not gonna get clean if you don't.
 Yeah. It's gonna get worse.
 What are we gonna do? We gotta ditch him or something.
 Tell you what. How about you and me, we go out on the town? You know what I mean? We celebrate this whole slave situation. I'd love to, Charlie. I really would. But we don't have any money.
 What are we gonna do?
 Oh, I got money.
 What?
 Yeah, I got a whole bunch of money, bro. Frank's been hiding all of his money in my account. And why was I not made aware of this before? Uh, it's got something to do with the vig.
 What's a vig?
 Well, you know how gangsters, they talk about a vig?
 Yeah?
 And it means
 Yeah. Oh, a vig!
 A vig.
 Yeah. Well, you should have a vig.
 I should have a vig, right?
 And Frank didn't give me one.
 Oh, that's bullshit! You deserve a vig.
 I do. I'm a good guy, right?
 You're a great guy.
 I'm a great guy!
 We're all great guys who deserve vigs.
 We're good people.
 All right, here's the plan. We're gonna slip out of here. We're gonna hit an A.T.M. We'll take out just a little bit of cash.
 Just a little.
 Just enough. He won't even notice it. Just enough to have a quiet night out. Here's some for you! Here's some for you! And here's some for you! Oh, God. Oh, shit! Dennis!
 Dennis!
 What happened? It's 4:00. I'm freezing and I'm sweating all at once. I think I may have peed in my pants. We missed our doctor's appointment. Well, only by an hour. If we hurry, maybe they'll still see us. It was yesterday. We missed our appointment by an hour and a day. We slept through a whole day?
 I feel awful.
 I feel like I'm gonna die!
 I don't want to feel like this anymore, Deandra.
 Mm-mmm. Me either. Okay, listen. Maybe if I make a phone call right now we'll be able to make another appointment.
 You think he'll see us on such short notice?
 We have gotta try.
 Hey, man. Thanks for seeing us on such short notice.
 That's what I do, baby. Two more, please.
 That guy. Yeah.
 Yeah. No, these are old, and I need to get new head shots. Because you can't have an an agent without head shots. Dennis, when you become a veterinarian, will you buy me some new head shots? Please? Dennis?
 Hey! Dennis! Hey, Dennis.
 Wha What? When you become a veterinarian, will you buy me head shots, please? Hey! Hey, get out of here, you piece of shit! Yeah, I'll buy you stuff. I'll buy you lots of things.
 I'm definitely gonna buy a bunch of crack.
 Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hey! Hey, that's Dennis and Dee! Driver, pull over! Hey, Dennis! Dee!
 Oh.
 Hey.
 Guys. Hey.
 Hey. Hey.
 Hey, how's it going?
 Good. Real good.
 It's good on our end here.
 We're putting a couple things together lately.
 Hey, uh, are you guys holding?
 Holding what? Holding Do you have any money?
 Please?
 Oh, um
 I just need a little bit of money. Wait!
 Charlie, wait!
 Charlie, wait!
 No! Driver, we're done here. That's enough whining, for crying out loud!
 I think it might be broken.
 I told you not to act like such a nancy boy out there.
 Something was bound to happen.
 I didn't think it was full contact. Well, how do you expect to become a better player if nobody pushes you? Maria, go get us some ice and three beers.
 I don't drink.
 Me neither. You don't drink? Jesus Christ! You two are a couple of downers, huh? You work hard, you don't drink How'd you end up on welfare? Well, it's a vicious cycle, Mr. Frank.
 One cannot support a family on a minimum-wage position. Oh, shh-shh-shh-shh!
 Y'ello?
 This is Pam from First National Bank.
 Charlie Kelly, please.
 Yeah, this is Charlie Kelly. Hi. I'd like to speak with you about some recent activity on your new account. Some recent activity on my new account?
 We got a big problem here, buddy.
 All right. Try it again. I've tried it three times. It's just not working. The services have already been rendered. We gotta pay these girls.
 He cut us off.
 Is there a problem?
 No. Not a problem here.
 No problem.
 I'm calling Hector.
 No, no. Don't call Hector.
 I'm calling Wallace.
 We shouldn't be calling Hector or Wallace
 or any other large pimp.
 No. Charlie and I are gonna handle this situation just like we handle every situation. We are gonna Well, you know, we'll just go back to work for a little while. Just for a little while until we have enough money to buy some more crack. Then we'll go on welfare, and I'll go be a star. Then I can be a veterinarian of some kind. Maybe we should think about rehab.
 We should hit rehab as soon as possible.
 Pretty soon.
 In a couple days.
 Yeah. Not now.
 Ahh, Jesus Christ! That was close.
 Ohh, look who it is! What the hell are you guys doing here?
 We're getting our jobs back.
 Yeah.
 You can't have em!
 We might have a little bit of a drug problem.
 I might not really care.
 I don't give a shit.
 Your positions have been filled.
 So we're gonna take yours.
 You're not gonna take our jobs.
 My dad called and said that we could have your jobs. We need money to pay our hookers, okay? So you can't have 'em.
 But we need money to buy crack.
 Oh, I'm sorry. Did you get addicted to crack? Did somebody get addicted to crack? I sweat uncontrollably! I can't get somebody to have sex with me unless I pay for it!
 Children, children.
  with me.
 What's all the fighting about?
 Did you tell them that they could have our jobs? Why don't we go on inside where it's nice and warm and we can settle this like a family?
 Come on.
 Yeah, what about the slaves? Slaves are gone. They were bringing me down. Plus, you know they don't drink?
 Drink? I want a drink.
 Wait, wait, wait!
 Stop a second. There are gonna be some changes made.
 Okay. All right? First of all, you two from now on are gonna do all of Charlie's work.
 I hate Charlie's work.
 No. Not his. Stop! Charlie, you got a lot of balls stealing my money. This shows leadership. I am promoting you to management.
 That's why I did it.
 That's fantastic! That's why I did it too. I stole lots of your money. What do I get? You get dick, because you are a follower and a thief. But how come Charlie? Not fair. How come Charlie? Why would you do this to us, Dad? Because you are crackheads, children. Yeah.
 Crack.
 Crack. Crack. Crack. Crack.                    
 What?
 Hi, Mrs. Reynolds.
 What do you want?
 Frank sent me over to pick up his toupee.
 His toupee?
 Yep.
 What does he need his toupee for?
 I think he has a date. Frank has a date? Yeah, I guess. Well, he can't have it. It's mine. You own his hair? All right, fine. It's in a box in the hallway. I was gonna throw it away anyway. So I'm really sorry about this. I know it's probably a tough time for you. Divorce is a tricky thing. Oh! I found it. I got the hair now. Found the hair. So I guess I'll just, uh, see myself out. Right. Thank you for the hair. Oh, shit. Wait till you see the hair. This is really authentic-looking hair. It looks good.
 So how do you know this chick, anyway?
 Angie Spinola High school. Firecracker. Hung out all the time.
 Oh, yeah?
 Oh, yeah. We did everything together. Wild sex. Whoa! I mean You name it, we did it.
 Well, she sounds awesome.
 Yeah. They don't make women like Angie anymore. Tell you that right now. Charlie, you gonna be okay, I leave you alone at the bar here? I think things have been going pretty well since you put me in charge, Frank. Right. Keep your fingers crossed. What are you? Why? Why would a person wipe their own shit onto a wall? I don't know. What are you doing? I thought you were cleaning the toilet. What? Cleaning toilet? No, that's what Charlie does. I'm not doing Charlie work anymore. Okay, Dad said we need to, so get back in there and clean the stall. Dee, Dee Will you take it easy? I got a little plan to get us out of it.
 You do?
 Oh, yeah. Oh, God, that's good news. What is it? Well, let's just say I got a little date tonight and as soon as Charlie sees who it is no more Charlie work for me. How does that help me?
 I guess it doesn't, really.
 Mm-mmm. It sure doesn't. You know, you should come up with a plan just like I did and then you can get out of Charlie work too. Oh, you think I can't come up with a plan? Hey!
 Dennis, hey.
 Got something for you. What? Really?
 Yeah.
 Wow! Oh, thank you.
 That's really nice.
 Can I take your coat? Uh, are we staying here? No, no. I just want to have a look at what you're wearing.
 Okay.
 All right. So what do you think? Yeah, okay. That'll work. Are you not wearing makeup?
 I'm wearing makeup.
 Really?
 Yeah.
 Do you have any more? No. I didn't bring makeup. Mmm. Uh, okay. That's all right. Let's go say good night to Charlie. Come on. Uh, I don't think that's such a good idea. Oh, no, no, no. He's totally fine with the situation.
 It's cool. Come on.
 Really?
 Yeah, yeah.
 Okay. Hey, buddy. Please knock if you're gonna be coming into my off What ya doin'?
 Uh, I was doing some office stuff.
 Oh, yeah? Well, listen, uh, we are gonna hit the town so we just wanted to pop back and say good night. Looks like you got everything under control back here.
 Yeah, I do.
 That's a nice house of cards, Charlie. Actually, no. I was doing some business stuff'cause I'm the manager now. Great. Well, we're out of here. Don't work too hard, okay, bud?
 Good night, Charlie.
 Yeah, good night.
 Could you, uh, give me one second?
 Yeah. Thanks. Okay, listen. Here's the deal. I'm gonna bang her tonight, probably around 10:30 or so. Now, I really don't wanna do that so all you have to do to stop me is call my cell phone by 10:30 and say, "Dennis, you don't have to do Charlie work anymore."
 You're not gonna get away with this.
 Oh, yeah, I will. I'll get away with it. 10:30, okay? Gonna blackmail me? You gonna blackmail me, Dennis Reynolds?
 You ready?
 I'm ready. Let's roll.
 Hey-o! What's up, buddy?
 Hello.
 What's that?
 It's your dad's hair.
 Gross.
 Yeah. Is Charlie here? Yeah, man. What's up with you? You seem flustered.
 Is Charlie
 He's in the back office.
 I wanna talk to him.
 Okay. Go talk to him.
 Okay.
 Great. Yeah. Uh Bye, Dennis. See ya. Charlie, I have a real dilemma on my hands. Normally I would never talk to you about these things because you're so unreliable but Dennis, Dee and Frank are all directly involved, and I gotta tell somebody, man. I am bustin'. Okay Dennis's mom tried to have sex with me.
 Interesting.
 Yeah, man, she got naked, she came on to me That woman is straight crazy, but I think I wanna bang her. I know I shouldn't do it
 I think you should do it.
 What? An opportunity like this only comes around once in a lifetime, right?
 Right.
 You'd be a fool to let it slip through your fingers. Yeah, that's what I'm thinkin', but it's Dennis and Dee's mom. Well, that means that no one ever, ever is gonna find out.
 That doesn't make sense.
 It doesn't have to make sense. You're right. I'm gonna do it.
 Okay. Okay. Oh, this is good.
 This is good.
 Oh, this is good.
 Oh, oh, oh I gotta meet Frank.
 I gotta give him his hair.
 You go, 'cause I gotta plot, and I gotta think.
 Oh, great.
 Get out of here. Go. God, this is good!
 Dennis's mom. Yes, he is. I'm busy.
 I want my job back.
 Look, I'm What?
 I want my job back. Well, I'm And you shall have it. Oh, Dee. It looks like we both need things from each other. I am not having sex with you, Charlie. No. It's not sex I want from you. It's sex I don't want from Dennis. Hmm? Mmm. So you gotta tell me about all the shit you been gettin' into. You must have a police record a mile long. Oh, God. No. Don't be modest now. You remember all the shit we used to get into?
 Mm-hmm.
 You remember that night in the graveyard?
 How could I forget?
 That slab was cold, baby. It was. And remember the time we robbed a motorcycle and ran it into the river?
 Yes.
 Well, you must be doin' shit like that now, huh? Come on. Well, I've slowed down quite a bit once I met my husband, Carl. Oh, you told me you weren't married. Oh, I'm not. Carl passed a few years ago.
 Oh.
 Once I met him and had kids, I pretty much stayed at home. Carl had two children from a previous marriage and then we had five of our own. Oh, shit. Hi. I'm Jenny. I'll be your server this evening. Are you ready to order, or do you need some more time?
 I think we need just a little more time.
 I'll be back in a second. Isn't having children a blessing? What? Isn't having children such a blessing? What the hell are you talking about? Well, I mean, when Carl passed, my children were an enormous source of strength.
 I mean, I thought
 Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait. Angie, I'm gonna have to stop you.
 I'm sorry?
 This is not gonna work out.
 What's not going to work out?
 You, me, talking like this.
 Why? What's wrong?
 For starters, you've got kids and shit. And you talk about 'em. You talk about your kids, you talk about your dead husband.
 I mean, it's kind of bummin' me out.
 Oh, you know, I'm sorry. It's not your fault. It's just, maybe I think you're too old for me. Frank, I'm two years younger than you. That's what I'm talkin' about. I had a really good time tonight. I had a good time too. Okay, what's the deal with that?
 What?
 Why do you keep checking your cell phone? I've just been I've been expecting an important phone call.
 I'm sorry.
 No. Good luck with that. Wait, wait, wait. Don't Don't go. I wanna go inside.
 No. I'm not gonna ask you inside, Dennis.
 Why not? Because I really like you. Well, yeah. I mean I really like you too.
 Then let's just take it slow, okay?
 Oh-Oh, wait. Uh I love you. L I kind of don't know what to say. I kind of don't want you to say anything. Oh, uh, hold that thought.
 Yo.
 I'm ready to talk. Cuttin' it pretty close there, pal. I almost sealed the deal. Just meet me at Paddy's and we'll work it all out. Sorry about, uh I feel like maybe I was being a little judgmental.
 You're good.
 Okay. Well, let's go. No. You were right. I should I'm gonna go. Yeah. I'm gonna go now. We should take it slow.
 You were right.
 Really? Because I don't need to now. I think it's good. I think it's real good. Call me. Charlie? You called just in the nick of time, buddy. I was Looks like we got a blown fuse in here. Better get on that. Blown fuses count as Charlie work. Oh, I don't think I'll be changing any fuses any time soon. I know something you don't know. That was, like, the best sex I've ever had, Mrs. Reynolds.
 Like something magical happened.
 Hmm? I was just saying that that was, like, so special and, I mean, it was like magic. You're not gonna start talking about your feelings and shit, are you? No. Gay. No. It's just that I mean, unless you want to, 'cause No. I got a better plan. Okay. All right. Uh, so can I call you sometime?
 I have your number, right?
 No, I don't think so. I know how to find you. Why don't we leave it at that? Wh All right. Did I do something wrong? I mean, was the sex bad?
 Don't worry about it.
 I can make adjustments 'Cause I've had to do that before, and it hasn't been a problem.
 I'm shutting the door now.
 Well, if I could just have a kiss good-bye that would be really great for me. If I gave you a kiss good-bye, would you let go of the door?
 Yeah.
 Fine. Oh, my God. Oh! Yeah. It's a terrible thing. It's a terrible thing for you to see that.
 I'm gonna kill him.
 No
 I'm gonna kill him!
 No. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. What are you gonna do, punch him in the face? Throw him? Work the body a little? No, no, it's not gonna help. I'll tell you why. It doesn't "un-bang" your mom. No, you gotta do something worse Something much, much worse. You're gonna have to bang Mac's mom. I thought I was.
 Hi.

 I'm looking for Mrs. Mac. Is she in?
 Yeah. I'm a friend of her son's.
 I know you, Dennis.

 Looks good on you.
 Yeah. Yeah. Do you mind if I sit? So. Watching a little TV outside, huh? I like the fresh air. Probably gets a little lonely though every once in a while watching TV out here by yourself.

Don't find you attractive. What? I think you're an ugly man. You think I'm ugly?

 Hi.
 Hi. I'm Frank. Wanna get down? Huh? What happened? What did you do? What are you talking about, what did I do? What was with that little move? That move always works with the ladies. Frank, you have never gotten a chick with that move.
 What are you talkin' about? That's how I got my wife.
 Really? Yeah. So don't go blamin' the move. The move works. So, uh, what other kind of things worked on your wife?
 She likes money.
 So she likes money and dancing. Can we stop talking about my wife for a second here? You're killin' the vibe. Let me see now. Over there. Try the move. You hang over here, this side, while I Hello, hello, hello. I'm Frank. Remember? Where'd he go? Mac! Go away.
 We need to talk.
 Dee, now's not a good time. Charlie is making me have sex with him to get out of Charlie work.
 What?
 Yeah, I know. Really gross. Am I the only one around here who's not getting laid? Dennis, Charlie is forcing me to have sex with him. Mac's getting laid. You're getting laid. Now even Charlie's getting laid? This makes me look terrible. Well, you know what? This is all Charlie's fault. None of this would be happening if Dad didn't put him in charge. You're right.
 I'm gonna kill him.
 No, no. Whoa. You ought to do something worse than that Something much, much worse.
 Oh! Hello, Dennis.
 Hello, Mrs. Kelly.
 You look wonderful.
 Thank you. Oh. Oh, my! Well, uh, it's good to see you, Dennis. What brings you by? I wanted to bring you some chocolates.
 Thank you.
 Do you mind if I come in? Okay. Oh, no. That son of a bitch.
 I know it.
 No! No, he said he loved me. How dare he do that?
 I'm gonna stab him.
 Oh.
 I'm gonna stab his face off.
 No. No, stabbing's bad. You need to do something worse Something much, much worse. You gotta sleep with Charlie. Shh. Shh, shh, shh. I'm sorry, sweetie. I just don't find you sexually attractive. Are you kidding me? You don't find me sexually attractive? What in the hell is going on? What is wrong with you people? I am sexually a I am sexually attractive. I am an attractive man.
 Bam.
 What the hell is that?
 $443.
 Listen, Mac, let's just end this right now. I only slept with you to piss Frank off. Afterward I felt like I was gonna throw up. So Frank makes you want to throw up? No. You're not listening. It's you that makes me want to throw up. Oh. So you don't want to be my girlfriend anymore?
 Jesus Christ.
 Wait a second. Hold on. Wait! I'm confused. So you don't want to be my girlfriend anymore?
 Hey.
 Oh, shit! No, Mac, it's okay. It's all right.
 Listen, uh
 Okay, let me explain.
 Just let me explain.
 No, no. I understand, okay?
 You do?
 Yeah. Look, I I think I know how you're feeling. Oh, man. That is such a relief. Check this out. L
 You've done well.
 Thank you And your date with the waitress is all set up.
 Oh! Mmm! That is so wonderful.
 I have to ask you though How did you know that your mom wasn't gonna sleep with Dennis? Hmm. Guess I kind of overlooked that detail. Okay, time for phase three, Dee. No, Charlie. You said there were only two phases. This one's easy.
 Okay. Phase three complete.
 It looks good?
 You look really good.
 You sure?
 Yes.
 You're all done? I'm all done. You look great.
 Thanks for helping me out.
 You're welcome. The waitress is gonna be here soon. I'm gonna go back to bartending, and you will go back to handling poo-poo.
 Yeah, okay. Phase four
 No! No.
 I got a quick phase four.
 Charlie
 Let me squeak a phase four in.
 I won't You can't
 There's no squeaking of phase No. No.
 Okay, fine!
 It's over. Okay?
 Thank you. You are hereby released of all Charlie work. Hey, guys, uh, can you do me a favor and not get too drunk? All right? 'Cause I got some kegs that I need changing. Uh, there's, like You know what?
 There's some rats down in the rattraps.
 Yeah. Hello, gang! You're lookin' at the new Frank. Ooh! What the hell is she doing here? "What the hell is she doing here?" Really? Really. I'll tell you what I'm doing here. You wanna know what I'm doing here, shit-for-brains? I had sex with your dad. That's right, I had sex with your father because, just like you, I like my sex old and ugly. And with fake hair on their heads that falls off when you're having sex with 'em. It just falls off because that's what you do, Dennis Reynolds. You like to have sex with old people. And you said that you loved me! You said, "I love you,"and so I thought, "Okay, I love you too." How do you show love? You go and have sex with old people. So that's what I did too!                       I think what Mac's trying to say is that it's probably the greatest movie of all time. That's 'cause it is. Rocky IV is not the greatest movie of all time. Dee, what do you consider to be a good movie?
 I don't know, like, Million Dollar Baby
 Oh, come on.
 Are you kidding me? That is ridiculous.
 Come on. It won an Oscar. Rocky IV has Stallone in it and he bashes a Russian's face to all smithereens. Lifting anvils and shit, and pulling trucks through the snow. Million Dollar Baby is totally unrealistic.
 Girls can't fight. They don't have muscles.
 It's true. Okay, that is a horribly sexist thing to say. It's not sexist. It's just truthful. Girls can't pull trucks through snow.
 Can you pull trucks through snow?
 I absolutely could.
 You can barely walk in the snow.
 Excuse me. Time out. Is the truck parked in neutral?
 Hey!
 What, dude? Empty your pockets.
 Now.
 Okay. Hey, let's just all stay calm. Nice friends. Maybe one to two inches of snow?
 One to two inches
 And a Ford F-150. Right. In park, but no emergency brake. Maybe I could pull it four feet.
 I'd give him four feet.
 I'd give him five. What's with the gym bag? Just got back from a "Boxercise" class at the gym. "Boxercise"? What kind of queer shit is that?
 I'm learning self-defense.
 You wanna learn self-defense, you come to Daddy. I mean, all during the '60s, before I met my whore wife, I was a boxer. They called me Frankie Fast Hands. Frankie Fast Hands, everybody. Yeah, keep livin' in the past, Dad. Is this about that stupid Million Dollar Baby movie, Dee? No, actually, Mac, it's about being left with a mugger because my chickenshit brother and his friends ditched me.
 You ditched your sister?
 Absolutely.
 With a mugger
 The guy had a knife. Of course we did. What were we supposed to do? If I was there, I would have used my Frankie Fast Hands technique. Technique don't mean shit out on the streets. Guys have knives. Yeah. In boxing, there are rules. On the streets, we ain't got no rules. Ain't no rules out on the streets.
 You guys got no rules on the streets, you.
 Oh, please. Will you stop talking about the streets you three jackasses, like you've been there? I mean, any underground street fight in Philadelphia, you'd find tons of technique.
 You think you could teach me?
 In a month I'll have you kicking all their asses. Right. See you then. Dennis, I have an idea.
 Well, this is awesome.
 Yeah. This is amazing. There's blood everywhere. It's beautiful. Yeah, and we were totally right. These guys don't have technique. They get all cranked up like animals and beat the Christ out of each other. Look at all this money being thrown around.
 Dude, we gotta get in on this.
 Oh, yeah.
 Really, I think it's about who can take the biggest beating.
 Yeah. Get up! You know who can take a really good beating?
 Charlie.
 Charlie. Here she is The old gym. Smell that?
 That's the smell of hard work.
 And feet. That's the smell of big dreams. The smell of glory.
 It smells like feet.
 And feet. Does smell like feet.
 Frank?
 Oh, shit. Frankie Fast Hands!
 Holy crap. I knew it was you. I haven't seen you in years. Hey-Hey-Hey, Frankie, it's me. Bobby Thunderson.
 Yes. Yes. Yes, Bobby.
 Look at you! You really let yourself go. Oh-Oh, are you trying to get back into fighting form? No, I'm actually, uh, teaching my daughter some self-defense. Holy Holy shit, man. I'm training my daughter too. Hey, what do you know? Hey, look at her. Look at her over there. Look, look, look. Oh! Amazing. Hey, she's pretty too, huh? Like her old man, huh?
 Well, it's really nice seeing you, Bob.
 Yeah. Hey, don't listen to everything this guy tells you. You don't wanna get knocked out in the first round. Oh, my God, that's an annoying sound he makes.
 Ass hole.
 Yeah, asshole. Okay, don't listen to anything he says. He's a real creep. All right, now. Here, we're gonna start weight training. First things first Squats. Okay. That's it. Uh, that looks really heavy. Look. This is not gonna be a half-assed workout. We gotta really get into it. It's gonna hurt.
 Yeah, but I can't lift that.
 Just position yourself under the bar and listen to me. Here's what you're gonna do. You're gonna take all the weight on your neck. Then you're gonna jam your legs down and hyperextend your ankles and then shoot back up and lock your knees in place. Not one of those things sounds right to me at all. Look. You wanna fight like a man? You gotta train like a man. Now, come on. Gimme a squat.
 Ready. Go!
 Oh, my God!
 Go. Keep it up.
 Daddy, I can't.
 It's I can't.
 Keep it up. Keep it up. At least I got the one. Right? Yeah. Get out, get out, get out. We got a lot of work to do. Good, good.
 Ah!
 Mm-hmm. What are we doing? Charlie, you're, like, the toughest guy we know.
 Yeah?
 So nobody can kick your ass, right?
 Practically invincible.
 Yeah. Yeah, what's your point though? Well So here's what's gonna happen, pal. Dennis and I are gonna train you to be an underground street fighter. What? That is brilliant.
 Yeah, it is.
 Okay, what's the first step?
 First step is getting that shirt off.
 Yeah, let's get that shirt off.
 Why would I do that?
 That shirt's just gonna weigh you down. Yeah, and Rocky never wears a shirt when he trains so let's just go ahead and rip that bad boy off. I think I'm gonna wear it. That's ridiculous. You can't train and wear a shirt, dude. Now it's becoming this whole big thing. It feels a little gay.
 It's not gay. Just take your shirt off.
 It's not gay. Why can't I just get, like, all excited and passionately rip it off in the moment?
 Why can't you just take your shirt off for us?
 Just drop it for now. All right, all right. Uh, maybe you should punch something.
 There you go.
 Yeah, you should punch something Why don't you punch this board? Okay. Hold it steady for me.
 Watch your eyes.
 All right, come on. Oh! Oh, that's
 That looks like it stings.
 Oh, my God.
 What's that made out of?
 It's a board, so it's, you know, made out of wood.
 It's, like, particle board.
 It's, like, harder than wood, dude.
 No.
 It's actually softer than wood.
 Yeah, it's a lot softer than wood.
 Petrified wood.
 What happened, man? I thought you were
 I don't know.
 I wasn't drunk enough.
 You should be drunk for this.
 We should all be drunk for this.
 Let's get really drunk.
 All right.
 Yeah. You know what? I'll get some beers.
 Come with me.
 Wait, wait, wait, wait. Let him go.
 Mmm.
 I don't know what happened.
 Mmm. Mmm.
 Mmm. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Deandra, we've been at this for days now. It's like you have no motor skills. Just grab that bar and jerk it down behind your neck. Hey! How's the chip off the old block doin'?
 Bobby, not now, okay?
 Hey, your old man ever tell you how we fought back in '61? They billed it as "Beauty Versus the Beast." Wasn't much of a fight. First-round knockout.
 He went down like a
 Wait, wait, wait. Hold on a second. What's goin' on with you, Thunderson? What, are you trying to humiliate me? Uh, I think you did that to yourself 40 years ago. You know damn well you hit me after the bell.
 That was a cheap shot.
 What are you You know, excuses are like assholes. Everybody's got one, and they all stink.
 Oh, yeah? You wanna go at it right now?
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. You wanna settle this now? Let's do it right here. Let's settle this son of a bitch right here. Hey, hey. Take it easy here. Jesus. Show a little class, will ya? Geez. Look, I'm an old man. I don't fight no more. I let my daughter do my fighting for me. And maybe in a couple years, when this little graham cracker might have the stuff to compete, maybe we'll see. Wait. You know what, asshole? Why don't you go to hell?
 Dee, stay out of this.
 No. This guy has been all over us since we walked in. I tell you what, jerk. Why don't you take you big mouth and go someplace else with it? Listen, little buttercup, I'm just bustin' your old man's balls.
 You don't have to get your panties in an uproar.
 Oh, my God. Are you standing there? Come on, move.
 That guy is such an asshole.
 Don't blame it on him. You're not makin' any progress. I'm goin' to get the jump rope.
 Men are such pricks.
 Oh, tell me about it. I bet you're real tired of them pushing you around. Oh, God, you have no idea. If only there was a way that you could be physically tough enough to intimidate men. I'm sorry. Do I know you? Let's just say I provide a much-needed service around this place. Step into the shadows and, uh, we'll talk. Yeah? Mac and Dennis, dude. Open the door.
 What?
 It's Mac and Dennis. Open the door. Open the door, bro. All right, guys. Hang on a second. It's like, uh It's like 11:00 in the morning here.
 We don't care. Open the door.
 Surprise, bitch. You're hittin' me with that? Charlie, let's be honest. Punching boards isn't your thing.
 But that's okay.
 Yes, that's okay, because for you it's not gonna be about inflicting punishment it's gonna be about having punishment inflicted upon you.
 We need to smash things all over your body.
 Yes!
 No.
 Yes.
 We need to build up your tolerance to beatings.
 Hence the smashing.
 We used a trash can, but Dennis wanted to use a chair.
 I think he's ready.
 That's way too excessive at this point.
 That guy's ready.
 He's not ready for a chair.
 I'm tellin' you, he's ready. Hey! Guys! I can handle a chair. Go get a chair. See what you're doing to him? You're getting him all worked up.
 He's the toughest guy we know.
 Yes, he is, but he Hey, Mac! Get a chair, smash it on my back. That's the right attitude. He's got the right attitude. I'll tell you what. Charlie, go put on those little short-shorts.
 Let's take things to the next level.
 Yeah.
 But first things first. Let's get good and drunk.
 Let's get drunk!
 Whoa!
 Whoa! Whoo! Drink this. Drink this. Now, just to be clear, these aren't steroids, right? No, no, no, no. Of course not. These are performance-enhancing supplements. Okay, so how long before I start to notice something? This is the good stuff. You'll feel it almost immediately. But I should warn you, you may experience some mood swings some irrational thinking here and there but it is nothing compared to the long-term effects.
 Which are what?
 You ever punched a guy so hard in the eye he swallowed it? I'll get some water.
 How you feel, man? You drunk?
 Yeah. I'm pretty wasted.
 Great. So what do we smash first?
 I wanna smash a crate.
 Yeah, a crate on his back.
 Why don't you punch me?
 Punch you? Punch you?
 What? I'm probably gonna get punched a lot in the tournament, right?
 Yeah. All right.
 Okay, that's a good point.
 Let's punch him.
 Pop that shirt off, and we'll start punching.
 Oh, my God. Really?
 Yeah, man. Every time I'm gonna take
 Why can't you just take it off?
 Just take it off.
 You're ruining the moment.
 What is with you and the moment? You know what? Forget it. Forget it.
 Who do you want to punch you first?
 I don't care.
 That was good.
 Well, you caught me off guard. That was a big part of it.
 That was the same spot. The same, exact spot.
 Yeah. Charlie, if we keep this up, you're gonna be the best underground street fighter ever, bro.
 Okay. Okay. Deandra.
 Just 10 more minutes.
 No, no. That's it. Dee, that's
 I love it. I need more of it. It's dangerous. Enough. Enough. Come on, what the hell has gotten into you the last couple of days? What the hell is that supposed to mean? You think I can't do this by myself? You think I'm on something?
 "On something"?
 Yeah.
 I never said you were on something.
 Then don't. Don't start. Hey, now we're talkin' here. She's a killer. You're goddamn right I'm a killer. You look like a Holocaust victim in pageant makeup.
 I will eat your babies, bitch.
 Bring it!
 Nobody's eating babies.
 Hey, you lookin' to spar, little girl?
 No. No fight. She's not ready.
 Oh, I'm ready.
 No, you're not ready.
 I'm ready! Let me eat her babies.
 What about next Friday, huh?
 Yeah. How's Friday?
 You're crazy.
 How's Friday to you? What's the matter, "Frankie Fat Hands"?
 You're afraid she's gonna get knocked out just like you did?
 Hey!
 Get this lion off of me here.
 No! No! You stop it. This is my fight. Do you understand me? I'm sick of men getting in my way. This is my fight. You hear me?
 You hear what I'm saying?
 Maybe we should leave these two alone, huh? Okay. We'll see you next Friday, huh? "Beauty Versus the Beast II." Come on, Brianna. Here we go.
 You're not ready for this fight.
 Oh, I have an idea, Dad. Why don't you shut your fat little monkey face and hold the bag? I'm gonna paralyze this bitch. Yes, Dad, I know the fight is in a few hours, all right? I'm trying to find my goddamn headband. Is that okay? Is it okay with you if I find my headband before I come down there? Is that all right with you, Dad? Jesus! Why didn't we get the orange one like I said? This one might as well be goddamn camouflaged! Oh, good. Are you happy now? I just punched a hole in my wall! Are you sure you're okay, dude? No, I'm not. I start thinking, you know, and it makes It makes me so angry. What am I saying? Okay. Were gonna go We're gonna go sign you up for the fight.
 Yes!
 And you stay here and eat your eggs. Have the Have Make sure you eat some of the sandwich.
 Yeah, you can just meet us down there, all right?
 Can you meet us later? Meet you later? Can I meet you later?
 Are you gonna meet us?
 Yes, I'm gonna meet you there later! All right. All right, sign here, here and here. And what is this? These are waiver forms in case your fighter is seriously injured or killed. Oh, we don't care about that. Sign away.
 What's the, uh, fighter's name?
 Clown Baby.
 Clown Ba Clown Baby?
 Yeah.
 You mean like a baby clown?
 Not a baby clown. A clown ba It's like a baby It's like a clown that is a baby.
 I said cl clown baby.
 Mm-mmm. You said baby clown.
 I don't even care.
 Yep. "Clown Baby"? What in the hell kind of a name is Clown Baby? Bro, it's perfect. Nobody's gonna bet on a guy named Clown Baby. He's gonna be a huge underdog.
 Which means we stand to make even more money off him.
 Exactly.
 Oh, that's brilliant.
 Hey, pal, 500 bucks on Clown Baby. Oh, Dennis. 500? That's all we got, dude. You saw Charlie. We turned that kid into an animal. Oh, yeah? Call me a Holocaust victim? Say you're prettier than me? Okay, maybe that part might be a little bit true. We'll see how pretty you are as soon as I punch a hole in your Wha Where the he Who took my shit? I might have had some. What did you just say, you little bitch? I might have had some of your pills or whatever. Oh, yeah? I am gonna punch a hole through your face. I'd like to see you try that. Yeah?
 Ooh, you're gonna die!
 Oh, I am gonna rip your face off
 You're gonna die!
 Make a shirt out of it, and I'm gonna wear it. I'm gonna take one second to take my shirt off, and then you're gonna die! What the Hey, listen, lady. You wanna beat up on your little boyfriend, you go do it somewhere else. Watch the car.
 Dude, where the hell is your fighter?
 He'll be here.
 He'll be here when?
 Soon!
 Okay, you have five minutes to put a fighter in that ring.
 Okay. Just got off the phone with Charlie.
 Well, where is he?
 He's in jail with Dee.
 What?
 Apparently they got all hopped up on amphetamines and beat the shit out of some guy in front of the bar.
 Amphetamines?
 Yeah, like, steroids or something. I don't know.
 Damn it, Charlie.
 Look at the dude he was supposed to fight.
 He's the scrawniest
 I know! Charlie would have killed that guy. We're gonna miss out on all this money.
 Anybody could kick that guy's ass.
 I know. Come on. You could kick You-You could kick that guy's ass. You think? Oh, my God. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, you're, like, the second toughest guy I know. I did bash Charlie good a couple times.
 You almost hurt him once.
 With the bottle?
 Yeah, and that's next to impossible.
 That was good.
 You're You're good.
 I am good. Yeah. Tell you what. Um Why don't you go stretch out. I'll talk to the bookie and let him know that Clown Baby has arrived.
 Let's do it.
 All right. Goddamn it.
 Frankie, what's the deal?
 She got arrested.
 Ah! I knew that skinny bitch would chicken out.
 So we'll never get the fight. That's a shame, Frankie. Lot of unanswered questions. You want your fight? You got your fight. You and me, right now.
 Well, I No.
 What? Daddy, you can beat him. Come on.
 You're next.
 It'll be like the old days. I will kill you. I will knock your nose off your face. You wanna knock something, you knock it off of me.
 That's right.
 All right, you got a fight. Greg, get my gloves.
 I'm sorry, bro.
 Yeah, well, sorry's not gonna get our money back.
 He was so fast.
 You should have moved around a little more and tired him out.
 We have nothing.
 I don't know what to say.
 I gave it my best.
 Yeah. You know what? Your best wasn't good enough.
 Hey, you have the time?
 Aw, not you again. We don't have any money. We just lost it all.
 Empty your pockets.
 Hey, meth-head. Are you listening to me? We don't have any money. Do it, or I will kill you both. Okay, here you go. Look. Empty.
 Now you.
 I don't have anything.
 Do it.
 I don't have
 Just empty your pockets.
 No. I'm not emptying 'em. I'm not even gonna I don't feel like standing in this alley all night.
 It's a matter of principle.
 A matter of principle?
 I don't feel like standing in an alley with a meth-head.
 I'm gonna stab you, man!
 For the love of God, empty your pockets.
 Okay.
 What the hell is that?
 Give it to me. You give us a second. Where did you get that money? I had to change the bet a little.
 You bet against me?
 I bet against you.
 Why would you bet against me?
 It was the right move.
 I mean, you got your ass kicked.
 Why wouldn't you tell me? I could have taken a dive. I wouldn't have had to get my ass kicked. Mac, it had to look real. Were you gonna tell me eventually?
 Yes.
 Yeah?
 I was going to tell you eventually.
 Yeah? You know what? Stab this son of a bitch. Oh, wait a second. Oh, come on, Mac. Don't be like that, man. You would have done the same thing. Come on, don't act like a baby. Please don't stab me. Bash this ugly jerk's face in, Daddy.
 Your last chance to chicken out.
 That ain't gonna happen, Bobby.
 I've been waiting for this for a long time.
 All right, Frankie. Seeing that we're a couple of old men here I think we should lay down some ground rules. Now. Number one. Holy shit!                       Aw, come on! This isn't fair. You accidentally burn down a building, and you get 120 hours of community service?
 Now this says that I gotta work with kids.
 Yeah, me too.
 I don't like kids. I don't wanna work with 'em.
 I don't have time for this.
 Yeah, I have 248 hours of, uh
 Interstate. Inter Interstate.
 Sanitation. Jesus Christ!
 What is that What is that?
 That's the guys with the orange vests who pick up trash.
 Orange vests.
 Oh, my God! And then what is this about the A. A?
 Alcoholics Anonymous.
 For
 Oh, my God.
 Six months.
 That is so unfair! What do you expect? Why would you tell the judge you were drunk?
 'Cause I was drunk.
 But why would you say that?
 I thought that would get me off the hook.
 That was dumb, wasn't it? I would rather pay a huge fine than have to give back to the community.
 Holy shit! Look at this bill!
 What?
 Those mimosas were like eight bucks a pop, Charlie.
 Are you serious?
 Well, you had like seven of'em.
 Uh-oh.
 Bro, I'm not paying for your mimosas.
 No way!
 I didn't even bring enough money for those.
 I don't have enough money. You don't have any money? What are you Are you serious? Ah! Ah! Good. Good. Good. Go ahead. Go ahead. I know what it is. We can't go back. I fold. Deal me out. Hey. Hey, gang, what's the action?
 What's going on here?
 Asians love gambling.
 You know these guys?
 Yeah. From 'Nam.
 You were in Vietnam?
 Don't get excited, Mac, all right? He was in Vietnam 10 years ago on a business trip.
 Beautiful country.
 Dad, please get these guys out of here.
 They're really weird and scary looking.
 Yeah. Hey, I own half this bar too. You can't just come in here and start running our lives. It's not fair.
 Wanna bet?
 What?
 Would you like to bet on it?
 On what?
 Whether or not it's fair?
 Sure. Bet on whatever. You know what? This is exactly why I don't wanna work with him. You know what I mean?
 Yes.
 Because you start doing crazy shit like this all the time and making crazy bets about absolutely nothing at all, Dad. If you don't go, me and Mac and Charlie, we're gonna sell our portion of the bar.
 No, we're not.
 No, that's not happening.
 Just back me up on this.
 No, I can't really back you up. Why can't you just back me up on this? You guys Screw this. I'm out of here. That just blew my mind. That was incredible. So today's speaker is David for those of you who are new to the program. I know a number of you have heard David's story before. But a few of you haven't. I'm sure you'll find David's story has a lot of relevance to your situation. Uh, anyway, I'm gonna go ahead and We have a late arrival here. Hi. Do you want to introduce yourself?
 Me?
 Mm-hmm. Oh. I'm Charlie. Hi, Charlie.
 Here. Have a seat down front.
 Oh. No. Okay. I knew this would happen. I'm not an alcoholic actually. Yeah, I'm only here 'cause I got a little drunk and I threw a flaming bag of feces into a building and I burnt it down a little bit. You know? But I wasn't trying to burn it down. I was trying to make the place smell real bad and get rid of this guy. So This guy knows what I'm talking about. Look, uh, Charlie, the first step to recovery is simply admitting that you have a problem. I'm not an alcoholic, so it's cool. He was drinking a beer when he came in. Oh, my Dude! Oh, dude, how are you gonna Really? I thought you were cool, man, like I'm not gonna sell my piece of the bar. You're being such a dick about this. What do you want me to do, get another job? Well, try to think where I'm coming from in all this. I'm coming from a selfish place?
 Just shut your mouth.
 Can I help you? We are here as part of our community service.
 Always a bunch of clowns.
 Excuse me? All right. We need volunteers for our Sunday basketball league. You're gonna be coaching the teams. I got two positions left, so I'm gonna have to put two of you together. Great. Dennis and I will coach a team. I think I'd rather split you two up. Charlie. Hi. Hey. Wow. I didn't know you were in A.A.
 Yeah.
 Where were you sitting? I, um, kind of slumped down in my seat when I heard your name so you wouldn't see me. Right. Listen. I didn't realize you were an alcoholic. It actually explains a lot of your past behavior. Check this out. I'm not an alcoholic.
 See, I have to be here 'cause the court
 Okay.
 I threw this flaming bag of feces
 Okay, okay, okay. You don't have to give me explanations. I understand. I've maybe been a little too judgmental of you. I mean, I know what it feels like to have alcohol run your life.
 Doesn't run my life.
 And I I want to maybe help you. Are you saying you want to go out on a date with me?
 No. No, Charlie.
 No? I don't I never want to go out on a date with you.
 Great.
 What I'm saying is maybe I could be your sponsor.
 Oh!
 But you can't ever hit on me.
 No.
 Because that's never gonna happen.
 Yeah, I heard. You said that.
 Okay.
 So, sponsor. That's cool, yeah.
 Okay. Okay.
 Well, I wrote down my phone number.
 Wow. Please. Please, Charlie. Please don't make me regret giving this to you. No, absolute Absolutely not. No, this'll be a platonic sponsor-sponsoree kind of a thing. Great. Oh. No shit! I was so close. All right, kids, kids. Uh, why don't you line up on this free throw line over here. All righty. Uh, you you, you, you and you come over here. All right. Now the rest of you kids can go with those two losers right there. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What the hell's goin'on over here?
 Pickin' my team.
 No. No, y-you can't you can't take all
 I can't pick the
 You can't pick all
 What should I not pick?
 You know exactly what you've done, sir.
 Okay, everybody back.
 Whoa, whoa, whoa! That's my team!
 No, we're startin' over.
 All right. Fine. But I pick first.
 Fine.
 You.
 You.
 Uh, you.
 You.
 You. Hey! Ho! What's goin'on over here?
 Pickin' teams.
 The teams are already picked. You two have the Ducks, and you have the Wildcats. Ducks. Are you kidding me? Are You guys are the Wildcats? Jesus Chri Is anyone absent? Anyone tall? What are those, flip-flops? Jesus, kid. Did you not wear shoes? You don't know? Did anyone else not bring shoes? All right, kids. Everybody take a knee. Go ahead and kneel. Apparently there is some confusion as to who is the head coach here. Yeah, it could be a guy who's never participated in any kind of sporting event ever. Yeah, or it could be a girl. That's enough said, right? Mac and I are gonna play a quick game to 21. And the winner will be head coach. You guys might want to pay attention 'cause you could probably learn a thing or two from watching us. Absolutely. Try to remember what she does wrong. That's the first thing. Terrible. Take a lap. God awful. Get goin'. Oh, that's a great shot, Chris. Come here. You're gonna be the saving grace of this team. Everybody try to be a little bit more like Chris.
 What the hell is that?
 I don't know.
 It's diet.
 Oh. Do I look like I need to be on a diet? I don't know. Terrible. Take a lap. This one? Gonna get it this time? See, kids, that's 18-0. Fundamentals don't mean shit if you got no strength.
 My knee hurts.
 We're almost done. Oh, God. You son of a bitch. So this is your place? Wow! You know, it actually looks a lot like my apartment.
 Don't sit on my bed.
 No. No. Wasn't gonna. That's a good bed though. That's a beautiful bed. Nice and soft. Charlie, are you here to try to have sex with me? I can't believe you could ask me a question like that in my time of need. I'm sorry. That's okay. We We got a history, and you're suspicious. I get that. We got a crazy history, you and me. Oh, well. You know, maybe I'll just maybe I'll just get a little comfortable and I won't talk, and you can just kinda
 Just watch your feet on the
 tell me about
 I'll take my shoes off.
 No. Just don't take your shoes off. I'm really more comfortable if I take my shoes off.
 Charlie.
 So tell me about you. What kind of music are you into? What's your favorite color? You ever You ever owned a dog? Do you want a dog? This thing is cozy. Just ice it and it will go down.
 I know what you do to it!
 Hey, what's the action? Oh, Jesus Christ! Are you gonna keep saying that? Is that your catch phrase now?
 Dad, can you please get me some ice?
 What happened to your eye? Well, Mac plays basketball with his elbows. That's what happened. Youse were all playin' basketball? Yeah. It's a part of our community service. Gotta coach kids. It's part of our, uh, sentence. Like two teams playin' against each other? Yeah, that's generally how basketball is played. Basketball, huh? Here. And go! Very nice. Lot of tight footwork. That's it. Very good. Chris, doin' really good. You got some good moves. Dad, what the hell are you doing here? Oh, well, I just came because you were late. I volunteered.
 Hey, do some ball work.
 Why are you doing this to me? I figured maybe you and I could do a little father-son bonding.
 I don't wanna bond with you. Go back to bonding with Charlie.
 Charlie's with a girl.
 What girl?
 You know, the waitress girl.
 The waitress hates Charlie.
 How do you know that? Because he's obsessed with her and won't leave her alone. Quite frankly, I don't see what all the fuss is about. I banged her. I don't get it. Dennis, you shouldn't be sleeping with your friends' girlfriends. What, are you handing down life lessons? Get the hell outta here! Get off my court!
 What? Your court?
 Yeah.
 Wanna shoot for it? Free throws?
 Shoot for what? Throw me the ball. All right. Well, best out of three gets to be the coach.
 Dad, you don't wanna shoot me for it, because you'll lose.
 You wanna bet? Okay, kids, keys to the game. Elbows. Knees. Say it with me once. Ready? Elbows. Knees. Excellent. Excellent work. Now you're gonna want to utilize both of those over the course of the season, okay? Because the referees in this league aren't gonna call 'em. But they might, which is why you have to be very careful. Fouls can lose a game for even the most dominant of teams. Yeah, kids, could you excuse the assistant coach and I for a second? We'll be back. Don't you ever contradict me in front of my team like that. These kids need to know who their coach is. Well, I can see how they might be confused. Are those combat boots? Don't get all high-and-mighty because you got a pantsuit. You look like Big Bird! I got the season schedule right here.
 Get back! I can handle this.
 I have to see.
 What's up?
 Why are you here?
 I'm coaching Dennis's team.
 Not coaching my team.
 You lost fair and square.
 Don't give a shit. Oh, it is on! We play you guys first!
 We are gonna school your sorry-ass team!
 Wanna make it interesting? Dad, you don't wanna do that. Our kids are terrible.
 That's what a bad coach would say.
 A hundred bucks says we win.
 You're on. I'm gonna coach the shit out of this team.
 Well, assistant coach.
 Let's make it 200.
 How about five, bitch?
 What are you doing?
 You scared? You wanna quit? You can back out. 'Cause I can coach this team better than you or Dennis or Dad or any other goddamn man any day of the week. Whoo! Whoo! That's it! Gambling! Oh, I can't tell you how great I'm feeling. I haven't been this healthy in, like, a crazy long time. It's having amazing effects on my body.
 That's probably the best thing about it.
 Yeah. Wow. So you can probably stop coming over here all the time then, huh? Uh, well, I don't know. I just don't know if that's safe.
 Yeah, I think it's safe.
 Maybe if you think it's safe, I'll consider it. But whoo Hey, um, how's your friend Dennis?
 Hmm?
 I haven't seen him around much lately. What What's he up to? He's, like, working at some stupid youth center thing.
 He works with kids?
 Yeah. But he has to. That's why. Oh, my God. That is so sweet. Do you think maybe we could go down and see him? Why don't we roll down there today? You know, you and me. Celebrate the three days sober. Great. I'll get changed. Great. So get out. Actually I probably need to take a shower, 'cause I'm crazy sweaty from those. Charlie. I'm an alcoholic trying to get better and I'm getting kicked out on the street. All right. Jesus. You can start. These are wristbands and these are safety pins. I want everybody to insert their safety pin into their wristband sharp side out. All right, if you come down right on the top part and smash down with all your weight you'll break the kid's foot in three places. What if I get hurt? That's a good question. Now as long as you hurt the other kid as bad or worse than he hurts you you'll have done your job, and I'll be proud of you. Look how good he is with those kids. You like that, huh? Tell you what. I'll be right back. Okay, here we go. Lay it up. Shoot it up. Let's see. Whoo. Very nice. Okay, everybody take five. Chris, come on over here a minute. I'm gonna talk to you. Let's see. Go on over there. You go You guys go. Now listen. Clearly, you're the best player on the team. All right? Now I wanna give you a couple lessons that maybe Coach Dennis hasn't covered with you. Lesson number one: Winnin' ain't everything. Lesson two: Do you own a bike? Hey.
 Dennis, hey.
 Hey. I haven't seen you in a while. You haven't come by the coffee shop. Uh, yeah. Um, so I know that it was kind of it got weird after the
 Right.
 When we Um, anyway I thought maybe we could spend some time together again. Um, haven't you been spending a lot of time with Charlie lately? I'm helping him get sober. Right. Well, good. That's a good thing.
 Thank you.
 Yeah.
 So I don't want to get in the middle of that.
 Oh. So we shouldn't talk at all while that's going on. Oh. Good. All right. I'll see you. Wha You will see me.
 I'll see you.
 Yep, yep, yep, yep.
 Charlie, this isn't working out.
 Huh? I don't wanna be your sponsor anymore. It's starting to get in the way of my personal life. What are you talkin' about? I only offered to be your sponsor so I could get closer to your friend Dennis.
 What? Dennis?
 Yeah. Come on! That guy, he's like one of those cheesy Oh, he's so phony. No. You know what? We can't do this action. You gotta 'Cause what if I start drinking again? That's a risk I'm willing to take. I hope you guys are ready for the pain. Oh, we'll be bringing a little pain of our own.
 You guys are goin' down.
 We'll see.
 All right, kids, how are you feelin'?
 Good. Good? Doesn't sound good. Are you drinking the Red Bull?
 Come on. Chug 'em down.
 I feel sick. That's the vitamins ripping out the inside of your stomach. That's a good thing. Trust me. Flop, come here for a second. All right. These are for you. And there's a steel toe in there. Don't be afraid to use it.
 Thanks, Dad.
 I'm not your dad. All right. Let's get this show on the road. All right, Team Wildcats! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! All right, boys. Now listen up. This week Where's Chris?
 Uh, I don't know.
 You don't know? You guys know where Chris is?
 No.
 Ah, it's no big deal. We don't need him. It is a big deal. We can't play without Chris. I got 500 bucks on this game.
 Are you crazy?
 Well, let's
 I gotta find him. We can't play without him.
 No. You can't go.
 He lives a block away. I'll be right back.

 So ride your bike after the game.
 I'm not supposed to play.
 What do you mean, you're not supposed to play? You know what? I don't have to talk to you, shithead! You bought Chris a new bike to throw the game. The bet's off.
 Whoa!
 You can't call the bet off.
 Dad's up to something.
 I'm not up to nothing.
 Excuse me. Hey, Dennis.
 Yeah? Hey, um, just I want Just good luck out there. Okay, yeah. What are you talking about?
 I just wanted to say good luck.
 All right. Great. Thanks. Um, why don't you have a seat on the bleachers? I'm in the middle of something. No way. I'm not sitting up there. It's way too smoky. You cheating piece of shit. Oh, let's go! Let's Let's play some basketball, all right?
 Charlie, what are you doing?
 I volunteered.
 Let's play some ball.
 Oh, my God. You know what, man? You gotta call this game off. Oh, you're dead to me. There's a dead man speaking to me right here.
 Great. You're drunk.
 I'm dead to you? Yeah, I am drunk. You know why?
 I don't have a sponsor anymore!
 Whatever, Charlie.
 Let's play basketball!
 You gotta call this game off, Charlie!
 Let's have the teams! Let's play ball!
 Let's play. You're not gonna get away with this, Dad. I haven't got a clue what you're talking about. Get him with the elbow! What the hell are you doing? Hey, hey. Right? All right, Charlie, that's it! You call this game! This game is over!
 You got a problem? Button that lip!
 Don't tell me to button my lip!
 Is that a threat?
 Yeah, that's a threat!
 You're outta here!
 Charlie, what are you doing?
 I call 'em like I see 'em.
 Come on, man. Calm down.
 You're outta here!
 Oh, my God!
 Yes! I'm head coach!
 This is your fault, Dad!
 Why is it my fault?
 Because you fixed the game!
 You fixed the game?
 What are you talking about?
 Yes, he fixed the game!
 What are you talking about? How do you do something like that? Do you see what you've done? Get out ofhere! You're in the showers!                      
 Most would agree.
 I don't agree.
 Will you look at your skin?
 I am. What's the matter with it?
 It's all blotchy.
 How? I don't see it. Dad, will you look at Sweet Dee's skin and tell me it's not blotchy?
 Do I have to listen to this shit all morning?
 Come on. Frank, you've gotta be kidding with these receipts. We were actually doing better before you took over. Hey! Hey! What's up, guys? I didn't hear you guys come in. Uh, you know, I was actually in here early opening up this morning Charlie, we had an agreement. This is a place of business, not your home.
 Uh, yeah, I know that.
 Not supposed to sleep in the bar anymore, bro.
 I wasn't.
 You didn't come home last night. Oh, okay, okay. Well, guess what.
 I found some extensive water damage in the back office.
 What? Yeah, so, maybe I'm not such a bad guy for passing out in there and drinking too much or whatever.
 That's a terrible excuse, dude.
 Well, I drank too much, so lay off. Holy shit! Guys, come here! Come here! Check this out! Look!
 What?
 What? That is the Virgin Mary.
 What?
 Oh, take it easy, bro. No, look. The head and the arms and the cape.
 Does look like it. Weird.
 I don't see it. What if it's a sign? You guys, remember, I wanted to be a priest.
 That's a water stain, dude.
 Or it could be a sign that we need to get our pipes fixed. What if it's a miracle? Listen. It could be a miracle. It could be bullshit. There's only one thing we know for sure.
 What's that?
 It's a goddamn gold mine. Well, I'll tell you, Jim. I was in the back office and I'd just finished praying on my rosaries. And I was doing some crunches, you know, working on my abs. And that's when I saw it. And I thought to myself "That is definitely the mother of our Lord." Did my face look fat?
 Yeah.
 No, don't-don't screw with me here.
 Seriously. It's just the TV, right?
 No, it's been looking fat. So, if you like the Virgin Mary and you like beer, come on down to Paddy's Pub.
 We got 'em both.
 Welcome to Paddy's Pub, home of the Blessed Mother.
 Would you care to make a donation?
 How much should I give? Well, what price can one put on the viewing of a miracle? Give whatever you can. These people are pathetic. Yeah, Dad, I really don't feel very good about what we're doing in here. Well, don't get all high-and-mighty on me. I only made four dollars, Deandra. I think I can live with myself. Let's move, lady. We got a long line here. Don't be selfish. All right. Rollin' on in. This is one of the more ridiculous things we have ever done, dude. I will tell you what is ridiculous Taking advantage of the mother of God. Are you kidding me? That is a water stain, man. We are really pushing our luck with the big guy upstairs on this one. Dude, if you don't think you're going to hell, you need to take a long look at yourself.
 Go look at yourself, bro.
 Okay, I'll do that.
 Yeah, do it.
 Dee Reynolds? Oh, wow. It is you. Matthew Mara. We were in physical therapy together twice a week after school. I was the only other person in physical therapy with you.
 Huh.
 I wore the giant leg braces.
 Oh, my God. Yeah, with the leg braces.
 Yeah.
 Wow. You look different.
 Yeah, so do you. No more back brace, I see.
 You look wonderful. Yeah.
 Oh.
 Matty Mara?
 Hello, Mac. I knew it! I called it from across the bar, even without the cripple braces.
 So, what? You're a priest now?
 Wow! Look at you. Little Matty Mara all grown up, huh?
 Hey, Dennis, little Matty Mara's here.
 Hey-oh! Hey, you come to witness the miracle for yourself? Miracle's a strong word, Mac. We don't just throw that around like a football.
 Well, you should.
 Well, I just came out of curiosity. See what you had at this bar of yours.
 You have to admit it's her, dude.
 Well, it's quite a likeness.
 Yeah. You think it's a sign?
 No, it's a stain. But, uh, it's an interesting stain. I'll give you that.
 Hey, Matty.
 Hello, Dennis. How are you? I've been better. I've been better. Let me ask you a question, man. I know it's been years since we've seen each other but does my face look fat to you? Well, we've all put on a few pounds since high school, so Of course. Of course. But I don't look fat though, right? Um, no.
 What did we call you in high school?
 Rickety Cricket, dude! That's right. Rickety Crickety Legs. Yeah, his legs were
 Yeah. Yeah.
 Hey, remember how you would pass out at parties
 and Dennis would tea-bag you?
 Yeah, then I would take the photo. We'd pass it around the school. Everybody loved those photos, Matty.
 Hey, you still get balls-to-the-chin cracks?
 No. Actually, that was a long time ago.
 It would be funnier as a priest.
 Oh, my God. Those
 Those were hilarious.
 You don't understand how much everybody loved those.
 My balls on your chin.
 Everybody loved you, man. I think people still have copies. There's a lot floating around.
 I saw them on the Internet!
 You were, like, famous in school.
 Yeah, practically. I got a whole shoe box of those things.
 That's partially our doing.
 Well, let's let's I should get going, so, um
 Okay. Hey, hey. Check it out though. Um, why did you pause before you said "no" earlier? I'm sorry? Well, earlier when I asked you if my face looked fat, you kind of paused. I'm not sure. Uh, listen, Dee, it was great seeing you again.
 Oh, yeah. You too.
 Gentlemen.
 Cricket.
 Later, Cricks.
 See you, Rickety Crickety.
 I love that guy.
 How do you know the priest?
 Went to high school with him.
 We should get him to bless the stain.
 Why?
 This could be huge, Charlie. I mean, endorsement from the Catholic Church. No. No. See, you guys are taking this thing way too far. You know what I'm gonna do? Wash my hands of it. Washing my hands of the whole situation, Lord. He will smite you all. God will smite you all! Okay, uh, we should do it soon though because the pipe might leak a little more. The stain could fade. You think this priest would help you guys?
 I think Dee could get him to do it.
 Yeah.
 What? Why me?
 Oh, "Why me?" she says. The guy was in love with her. He would do anything for her.
 No.
 All right. Remember the time you said you'd kiss him
 if he ate a horse turd?
 He ate the whole turd. The guy eats the whole thing. Then she doesn't kiss him 'cause His breath smelled like shit.
 That's my girl.
 It didn't really happen like that. No. He ate the whole turd, and then she wouldn't kiss him.
 Hey, come on. This would be really good for the bar.
 No. Screw you guys. No way.
 That's a bad attitude.
 The priest may not do it because she's getting old.
 Oh! Yeah.
 What is that?
 Your skin's all blotchy.
 No, it's not.
 He's not gonna do it. You got the crow's-feet.
 Crow's-feet.
 No, I don't.
 You're getting the lines there. Mmm. Five head. Laugh lines. You know what? You guys are such assholes. I'm gonna see what I can do. Take care. Bye. Matthew, hi. Dee. Wow. What a nice surprise. What brings you here? Well, the guys and I kind of needed somebody to come and bless that stain in our bar.
 Are you serious?
 Mm-hmm. Dee, I'm not gonna bless a water stain. We don't do things like that. The Catholic Church Oh, no, no, no. I know not them. I was hoping you could do me a favor. I realize you were able to get me to do things for you in school, but Oh, you know what? I did. I kind of led you on a little bit back then, didn't I? But I wasn't always a tease, you know? Remember? I let you do all my math homework. Not sure I follow your logic. Well, what about that time we almost kissed? You made me eat a Look, I'm not blessing the stain, okay?
 Oh, no. Hold on a second.
 I mean, the taste of that thing alone
 No, I can't imagine.
 It haunts me. Of course it does. I'm sorry, okay? Forget Forget I came by about the stain. I don't care about that anymore. I just I know you really liked me back then, and I know I wasn't very nice to you. And I think that's just because I was too stupid to realize how wonderful you are. I'm sorry. And for the record, I think that you grew up to be very handsome. You do realize you're leading me on right now? I'm a priest.
 Am I? Oh, I didn't even know.
 Yeah. But if you wanted to grab a drink sometime
 You're still doing it.
 Oh, my God. I don't Wow, I I think it's just 'cause you look so handsome in
 Please leave.
 Okay, I'm gonna go now.
 Thank you. It would be best.
 All right.
 God bless.
 Yeah. Would you care to make a donation in the name of Paddy's Pub to the Blessed Mother?
 Mm-mmm.
 Charlie, this needs to stop. If you guys don't do it
 I'm gonna do it myself.
 You're telling me. I'm sick of doing this.
 God is going to show his wrath, Charlie.
 Excuse me. Are you the young man to whom the Holy Mother first appear?
 Yeah.
 Could you bless me, please?
 You want me to bless you?
 Please, senor. Uh, yeah, sure, I guess.
 In the name of the Father, the Son, Holy Spirit. Amen.
 Right hand.
 Gracias.
 You're welcome. Did you see that, dude? I just blessed that woman. I may have saved that poor, wretched old person's life. Well, I don't know about that, but, uh This could be my calling, Charlie. What happened to all that God's wrath business, and this has to end Yeah, I know. Don't worry about that, dude. I think this could actually be a good thing.
 We could change the world.
 Okay, okay. All right. New plan, all right? Let's go around, let's bless people. Well, actually, I should bless people though, but you could be my right-hand man.
 You could be my Peter.
 Oh. Okay, I'll be your Peter.
 Dress a little nicer though, 'cause you look like shit. Hey. How'd it go with the priest?
 Not gonna happen.
 Did you put the moves on him? First of all, gross. I don't think you're supposed to whore out your kids. Second of all, that guy is a really good person and I've treated him like shit his whole life.
 For once I'm gonna do the right thing.
 He thinks you're too old, huh? Goddamn it. Why do I speak to you, ever?
 Hello.
 Oh, wow. What is wrong with you? Oh, well, I've been fasting for three days, so I probably look good.
 You haven't eaten anything for three days?
 And I feel great. Why the hell are you fasting? I thought I would get in the spirit of the religious aspect of what we got going.
 It's 'cause we said his face looks fat.
 It is not.
 People have been fasting for thousands of years
 Face looks fat.
 For health and religious purposes. Moses
 Fat face.
 Jesus and Moses in the woods and in the desert
 Pretty fat, right? Fat.
 Please listen to me. Please.
 Forget it.
 Yeah.
 All right? The priest thinks Dee's too old for him. We gotta go to plan "B." I know another guy who could help us. Father O'Grady? Uh I'm Frank Reynolds. I was in your parish.
 What do you want?
 We came to talk to you about a stain. No! Uh, wait a second. We just wanna have a few words with you. We found a stain in our bar that resembles the Virgin Mary.
 Cats are brown now.
 What? The cats are brown. What in the hell is he talking about? This guy's perfect. Let's go clean him up. What are you doing?
 What is that?
 What? It's like
 Why are you dressed like this?
 Come on. It's perfect.
 Where did you get it?
 I have my sources. I told you to dress nice. We look like salt and pepper shakers.
 Ah, we look good.
 All right. Let's just get started.
 Um
 Mmm. Ah. Uh, excuse me, sir.
 Hello. Uh, would you like a blessing?
 From who?
 Well, it was to me that the Virgin Mary first appeared.
 Well, I found it.
 What?
 Well, I'm just saying I was the one who found it. Yes, but, uh, I was the one who first recognized it was the Virgin Mary.
 I found it, if you want the truth.
 You thought it was a stain. I'd much prefer a blessing from him.
 Why?
 He seems a lot more religious than you. He is my number two and doesn't really do the same
 Well, maybe I could just throw you one of
 Don't do it. Don't do it, Charlie. Don't do it!
 Ha!
 Thanks a lot. I appreciate it. Okay, feel better. You're looking better already to me.
 You are completely betraying me. You're supposed to be my Peter.
 You know what, dude? Hear me out for a second. Now, technically, that stain did appear to me. Also, I am familiar with carpentry and I don't know who my father is so am I the messiah? I don't know. Could be. I'm not ruling it out.
 The messiah?
 I'm just not ruling it out, is all.
 You gotta be kidding me, dude.
 Well, the Lord works in mysterious ways. I knew you were gonna ruin this. Goddamn it. Ooh. I really wish you wouldn't take my name in vain. How are we gonna get this guy to bless anything? He's out ofhis mind. Well, I'm hoping it's mostly the booze talking. Let's find some coffee. We can sober him up.
 Did you hear me?
 Hmm? Dennis, I think you really gotta eat. No, I just spaced out for a second. What's up?
 Find some coffee. We don't have a ton of time.
 Yeah. Here's a confession. I'm in love with a man. What? I'm in love with a man a man called God. Does that make me gay? Am I gay for God?
 You betcha.
 Can I talk to you, please?
 Speaketh.
 In private. Okay. Well, congratulations, Jim Jones. You found the four people on the planet dumb enough to listen to your shit. Oh, forgive him, Lord, for he know not what he say. Give it a rest. You're not the messiah. You don't know dick about the Bible. You know, it really sounds like somebody in this room is jealous. Because it's bullshit! I'm the one that wanted to become a priest I'm the one that knew it was Mary, I'm the one that should have followers.
 Sorry, bro. You suck at it.
 You wanna have a little competition?
 Like what?
 Let's go toe-to-toe on the Bible, bitch. Ask and ye shall receive, sucker. Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. It has been 10 years since my last confession. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, what's on your mind, my dear? I'm in love with a man that I can't have, Father. And he used to love me too, but then I was really mean to him and now we'll never know what could have been. Well, it's too late now. He's made a commitment that can never be broken. Let's drop this act, Matty. Listen, I think I have really strong feelings for you. Dee, please don't do this. You know what? It just seems like some kind of cruel joke. I mean, you wanted me once, and now that you can have me And, oh, Matty, I mean you could really, really have me. You don't want it anymore? Well, God has a plan for everybody.
 Well, that seems dumb.
 Well, it's not. It's God's plan.
 Yeah, well, God's plan sucks this time. You know why?
 Mmm.
 'Cause I think I love you, Matthew.
 Don't say that, Dee. I have to say it, and I'm gonna tell you why. Because if I don't say it, I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life. Okay, maybe that's not "God's plan" or whatever. I don't care. I want you to know something. I love you. And I I could be your wife, and I could spend the rest of my days making you happy.
 Dee?
 Yes. It's me.
 I know it's you. Just please, please leave.
 No, listen. Wait, wait, wait. I don't know what God wants for us, all right? But I do know God brought you into our bar and maybe that was just so I could say I'm sorry, but that sounds stupid. I don't think that's why. That's not big enough. He works bigger than that. Maybe his plan is for us to be together because he did have you come to our bar. Matty?
 What?
 Open the door.
 No.
 Matty, open the door. I love you.
 I know that.
 Okay.
 Say seven Hail Marys.
 Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. I love you. "When the Lord saw that he had gone over to look at the burning bush "God called from within. 'Moses, come no closer! Remove your sandals, for"' Uh, let's stop there. Why is God asking Moses to remove his sandals? Well, you didn't let me finish, dude. It's because Moses is about to walk on holy ground.
 No, actually, it's not.
 Yes, it is. That's the next line. "Remove your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground." But what's in between the lines? What's in between the lines is that he has to take off his damn sandals because it's sacred ground. No! Sacred ground? Sacred ground? God doesn't worship the ground. God made the ground. And Moses is about to step near a burning bush. That is gonna be hot. God doesn't think Moses is gonna do it. "Hey, Moses, kick your shoes off. Come on. Walk around a burning bush"? You know, that's like asking me to take my shoes off and stand on a hot plate. I'm not gonna do it unless God asks me to. And then I am, just like Moses. Why? What's gonna happen to Moses? His feet aren't gonna get burned. No. God is gonna reward him with some sweet-ass shoes. It's like, "Oh. Oh. You risk your feet, you get some shoes." That's the way God works, 'cause God loves us. Trust in God, he'll give you shoes. Are you kidding me? You're buying this crap? You All right. Here we go.
 Right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot.
 What are you doing? Who's this? This crazy, drunk priest Whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no, no, no, no.
 You get a drink after you bless the stain.
 Shh! Ooh, cats! And they're brown! Oh, this guy is great. Hey, you think he'll bless me?
 Love to.
 Great. Hey! It's okay, Frank. Hey, everybody, gather round. This priest here is going to bless me. Then after he's finished, I will honor each and every one of you with a blessing of your own. You can take that with you. Okay, Father. Anytime you're ready. The Father, Son and Holy Spirit. What is wrong with you, old man?
 Why would you bring somebody like this into the bar? Charlie, get the camcorder. The father's gonna bless the stain. Right foot, left foot. There we go.
 Dee. Dee.
 Whoa. You are not lookin' good, huh? Truth, truth. Face fat? No, you idiot. Your face is fine. I just got mad that you called mine blotchy.
 Oh. Why-Why-Why
 What?
 Why you do that?
 Oh, um, because you're a bad person.
 Charlie, you got the camcorder?
 Oh, yeah, yeah, I got it.
 Oh, Mac, Mac. This endorsement's gonna put me over the top.
 Go to hell, Charlie. Oh, these people are gonna be eating out of my divine hands.
 These people are gonna catch on to your shit.
 Are they really? Hello. No! No, get away from there!
 Get him away!
 Get Back off. Oh.
 What did you do, you shithead? You ruined it!
 Yeah. Oh! It's gone!
 Uh, no, actually, it's not gone.
 It's gone!
 The Virgin Mary has left us!
 No, she hasn't left us!
 You can see the outline.
 She abandoned us 'cause we listen to a false prophet!
 No! False pro
 False prophet.
 That's what you are, a false prophet.
 Where are you going?
 Looks like your followers are leaving you.
 No! Don't go. She'll come back. She'll come back.
 Dee.
 Matthew? What are you doing here? I thought about what you said, and I think you're right. I mean, in some weird way, this was God's plan for us. I mean, I had to become a priest to reconnect with you
 and I had to leave the priesthood to have you.
 Huh? Mr. Reynolds, I'd like to ask for your daughter's hand in marriage.
 Done.
 Okay, hold on one second.
 Bless you.
 Hold on. Did you just say that you left the priesthood? Yes! Yes, I had to.
 Matty, wow. You should not have done that.
 What do you mean? You gotta You should go and undo that right now.
 Uh, but you said
 Yeah, I know what I said. There were a lot of things, and I meant all of them. I did. But the thing is, I didn't know you were actually gonna leave the Church which is why I felt safe saying those things in the first place. So wait. Wait. So S-So you don't love me? Oh, Matty. I think you are a great guy. Ooh.
 My life is r My life is ruined.
 No.
 It's Yes, it's ruined.
 No. It's not. What about this? Why don't you go back to the priesthood? I can't, okay? L-I I can't. You can't just go back, Dee. "Yeah, I wanna become a priest again." You can't.
 Okay?
 But are you sure? Did you double-check that?
 Oh, my life is ruined.
 Hmm. So I'm the bad person, huh?
 That's what you get for not eating.
 Hey, Cricket! You know what would make you feel better?
 What could possibly make me feel better?
 You wanna tea-bag Dennis?
 I'll get the camera!
 Yeah!
 Polaroid, Polaroid, Polaroid.
 Whoo!                       These things are hilarious.
 These are priceless.
 What are you guys lookin'at?
 Uh, Garbage Pail Kids.
 Heavin' Steven.
 Classic.
 Totally classic. I love Heavin' Steven. Are those those stupid cards where babies are doing disgusting things? Uh, no. They're the amazing cards where babies are doing hysterical things. You got quite a collection there, buddy.
 Yes, I do.
 Hey, Charlie, how about givin' me a couple of these?
 Uh, no.
 I tell you what. I'll buy 'em from you. You got a ton of'em. No. These are, like, an investment. This is my future here, so don't mess with them. Hey, have you guys seen this? We are getting blasted in the ass by the state liquor tax. "Blasted in the ass"? Mac, we have this same conversation every year. There's nothing you can do about taxes. You guys might want to think about voting every once in a while.
 What has voting ever done?
 Why Since wh What has
 Why are you comin'down Voting?
 Who am I supposed to vote for? Am I supposed to vote for the Democrat who's gonna blast me in the ass or the Republican who's blasting my ass? Politics is just one big ass blast.
 It is a coast-to-coast, nationwide ass blast.
 You're gonna get your ass No more! You guys are such morons. If you knew anything at all about politics, you would know that that is not true. Deandra, it's just some jerk gettin' into office so he can get out for the payday. Right. The guy's runnin' for office. He's What? What payday? I see it every year. Some clown runs for office, drops out of the race and gets a big chunk of dough. I mean, you have to be a real low-life piece of shit to get involved in politics. Okay. I just got off the phone with the city clerk. Turns out there's an election comin' up.
 Local, small-time shit. Anybody can run.
 What's the position? "South Philly, Zone 2, District 37 Comptroller.
 Nice. What's a comptroller?
 Who gives a shit? We're doin' it for the bribe. I nominate Dennis.
 I accept your nomination.
 Wait a minute. How come he gets to be the candidate? Take a look at that hair Kennedy hair. Note the bone structure. It's like a young J.F.K. I got the same bone structure. What are you making that noise What is that about?
 You got something funky goin' on in the forehead area.
 Five head. Did you say five head? I don't have that. Deandra, a woman in politics is like a donkey doing calculus. Come on. There are plenty of amazing women politicians.
 Name one.
 Uh, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton.
 Awful.
 How is she awful?
 Hates freedom.
 Uh Okay, Dennis, you are gonna need a campaign manager. That's me.
 So
 Ooh. We should put that one to a vote. 'Cause I'd be a good campaign manager. It's too late. I already have the clipboard.
 So you can be my assistant.
 Mmm. Assistant is
 Should I wear a blazer?
 Yes.
 No.
 Yes.
 No.
 I like what he said. Charlie? Campaign manager. You don't need a blazer.
 A blazer's gonna look
 I like where he's goin'.
 What am I gonna do?
 You get to be the intern.
 Yeah, the intern.
 What does an intern do?
 Cut limes.
 Stock glasses.
 Serve drinks. No. No. Come on. You guys, damn you!
 I'm not doing that.
 Hold it! Hold it! If my son is gonna solicit a bribe, he's gonna do it the right way.
 I'm gonna be campaign manager.
 Like hell you are. You are way too old. Politics is a young man's game.
 Mac, I think you might be in over your head here.
 Yeah.
 Over my head?
 Yeah. Listen. Everybody who's in favor of firing Mac as campaign manager raise their hand.
 For God sakes!
 The people have spoken. You're out. So that's it? I'm fired? This is bullshit!
 That's politics, man.
 That's politics? That's politics? This is wonderful. This is just wonderful. You know what? I'm walkin' outta here. I don't need this shit. I'm washin' my hands of the whole situation. Show you, bitches.
 Can I grab that clipboard?
 No. That's mine. Dee, check out my blazer.
 Yeah. It's too small.
 Nah. It's perfect.
 How's the bar?
 Full of hoboes, Dennis. A lot of hoboes.
 Watch your ears. There you go.
 Frank. Frank, I don't I just don't think this is the best idea for our candidate's image. This is a brilliant idea "hobo-vertising." Come on. It looks good. Beer him.
 We gotta fire Frank.
 He's my dad, Charlie. I don't know. But, Dennis. Dennis. Hobo-vertising?
 That's not you. It's cheap.
 Ooh. It's cheap politics. It's not gonna get us that bribe. I mean, you need to be out there. You gotta be shakin' hands. You gotta be kissin' babies. I don't like babies. No babies. Don't kiss babies. Just get out there into the world, and You gotta let me be your campaign manager. I mean, I can really drive this thing in a different direction. I mean, when I look at you, I see success. I see You're top-notch. You're goin' all the way with this thing.
 Oh.
 Frank's just gettin' in the way here. Give me this chance. Just give it to me. I just didn't realize I was gonna have to make so many tough decisions. Take him down. This is a goddamn coup! Don't take it personally, Dad. That's just politics. You look like a dick in that tiny jacket.
 Let's not attack my candidate.
 Don't go after the jacket.
 Shut up, Charlie.
 The jacket's good. I can talk to my son any way I want.
 Give him the clipboard.
 Give me the clipboard.
 No. No.
 Clipboard belongs to the campaign manager.
 I want that clipboard.
 Go to hell.
 Oh, that was ugly.
 That was uncalled for.
 Mmm. Wow. That was, uh, a lot easier than I thought it was gonna be.
 I can get a clipboard anywhere.
 Yeah.
 All right.
 Don't do that.
 I want you to run for comptroller.
 What? I'm gonna be your campaign manager. We're gonna stroll right into that comptroller's office and solicit a bribe.
 Forget it. I am not helping you.
 Deandra, we'll get this bribe and we'll shove it right in your brother's face.
 We'll screw those guys.
 I would like to shove it in his face. Okay. Okay. Now let's get you ready for the ball, Cinderella.
 What are you doing?
 The bangs, they The five head. Let me get this straight. You want to try and solicit a bribe? Yes! You want my union to back your roommate for South Philly District 37 Comptroller?
 Yes. Correct.
 But not to win.
 It sounds illegal.
 Aw, for God sakes. What is with you two? Come on! You know, like, in the movies, union guys are, like, tough and shady and shit.
 Sorry to disappoint you.
 You're, like, a couple of nerds. All right, look. Let me take you bitches to school for a second. In this country, in the real world, people make money. Somebody is gonna make a ton of money off my roommate.
 I want it to be you.
 Let me make one thing perfectly clear. We are not a criminal organization. Why are you talking to me like I'm a jackass? I am not a ja Oh. I see what you're doin'. Okay. Nobody here is a criminal. No, sir. I think we're speaking the same language.
 Are we?
 Oh, yeah. We're being listened to. Bugged. The feds. I get it. I read. I see movies. I understand. Okay. I want you to contact me at Paddy's.
 I'm gonna get the ball rolling, okay?
 Mm-hmm. It's safe there. Okay, gentlemen, sorry we couldn't work anything out. But, uh, I'm gonna go home and pay my taxes. Right?
 You want me to call the cops?
 Not yet. I've got a better idea. Let's screw this son of a bitch. Come on, Morris. We don't have time for this. He called us nerds, Gary. Nerds. Are you gonna take care of the crime problem here? Absolutely. I say we put 'em on busses, ship 'em over to Iraq make 'em fight the terrorists. You're very handsome.
 Thank you.
 This is going very, very well, man.
 People are really responding to me.
 They love the bone structure.
 They like the Kennedy hair.
 I've been looking for you guys. Look, I've been thinkin', and I feel like I could be a real asset to you guys.
 I want to help.
 What? Wait, wait. First you wash your hands of politics. Now you want back in.
 That's called flip-flopping. That's what Democrats do.
 Hang on a second. Let's give the guy a chance to prove himself. Yeah. Give me a chance. What should I do? "What should I do?" Strike one, buddy. You gotta bring something to the table, Mac. All right. Ah, check this out. Excuse me. Hi.
 I couldn't help but notice your adorable baby.
 Oh, thank you. Yeah, I was wondering if you wouldn't mind if that handsome young gentleman over there kissed it.
 Excuse me?
 Oh. I'm sorry. He's running for District 37 Comptroller, so it's cool.
 You know, I'd rather not.
 It's good for him, and it's good for you.
 I think you should just give me the baby.
 Please leave me alone. Okay, lady. If you give me the baby, I could get it over with.
 I said no!
 Goddamn it! Just give me the baby!
 Somebody help me!
 Lady! Give me the ba
 This is campaign suicide, dude.
 Let's get outta here. There, there, there. There, there, there. Take a look.
 Got it on? Sure?
 Yeah. Take a look.
 What do you think?
 I think I look like a whore.
 I'm trying to make you sexy.
 This is not sexy.
 What is this? What's this?
 It's the bed look. The tossed look. The ruffled look. You look like you just got Anyway, we have to convince this guy That we're a legitimate threat to his campaign. There is nothing more threatening to a man than a woman who is smart and attractive. We have to pretend you're both. Wow. You're a horrible father.
 Let's just go. Let's get it done.
 Great. Great. Now, Daddy hates to say this, but I think we should talk about the breasts. "Oh, don't hurt my baby." Like I'm gonna hurt somebody's baby. You know what I mean? Goddamn Dennis. Fire me?
 I'll fire you.
 Mac. Get in. We got a bribe for your roommate's withdrawal from the race. Really? Wow. You nerds work fast. All right. How much did we get? We don't get any money until you pull your guy from the race. Oh. Okay, uh That's not gonna be a problem, is it? No. That's not gonna be a problem. Better not be, Mac. Otherwise, Marvin here is gonna have to take care of you. Take care of me how? I'll probably stab you in your throat. Jesus Christ! Stab me in my throat?
 Are you serious?
 Pull your guy out, Mac. I'm gonna pull him out. I'm gonna pull him out, Marvin. Marvin, I'm gonna pull him out. Okay. Who's the nerd now, bitch? That was fun. I feel like a gangster. Shut up, Gary. I'm not dropping out.
 Bro, you have to drop out.
 Why? I didn't wanna say this before, but you don't have Kennedy hair.
 All right! Oh, God!
 You don't have thejawline.
 How could you say that?
 If I hear one more flip-flop out of you I'm gonna throw up in my mouth.
 You ready to do this?
 I'm just doing some fine-tuning.
 It looks good.
 Just trying to get my tan on. Let's hurry. The battery on this drains like a tub. What is going on in here? Are those beach towels? We're gonna shoot a commercial, get it on public access, get the message out.
 It's a million-dollar bill pal.
 Yeah. A million-dollar bill. You guys are never gonna get a bribe.
 It's not about the bribe anymore.
 We don't care about that.
 I could be a legitimate politician.
 He's goin' to the top.
 Really do some good in Philadelphia.
 Are you listening to yourself?
 You've never done any good for anybody ever!
 I do good! I do good!
 You never do anything! You're a loser!
 You're just jealous!
 I'm not jealous!
 All right! All right! That's That's no way to run a campaign, boys.
 Let's have the conversation outside.
 All right. We'll talk outside.
 Yeah, we'll make you happy.
 You're droppin' out of that race.
 We'll work it out.
 I'm droppin' out of shit.
 We'll work it out.
 Yeah, we'll work it out. You and me and
 Did you just lock this door?
 Yes, I did.
 You are going to hell, little man!
 Mmm, I don't think so.
 That's politics, bitch.
 I hate you, Charlie!
 You ready?
 I'm ready.
 Goddamn it! Get in front of the flag and the million-dollar bill. Dude, you and my dad share this futon? No. No, we No, we got a whole different situation worked out.
 What's the situation?
 It's I sleep on the And You got the script that I wrote? Grab the script. I've been meaning to speak to you about this. I can't read these words. They're not in the right order.
 It's good.
 I think you might be dyslexic. I'm not readin' this.
 No, no! Please. Read it.
 I think you might be dyslexic.
 Read the script.
 You want me to read the script?
 Yes. And action.
 All right. I'll read the words you wrote. "Hello, fellow American. "This you should vote me. "I leave power. Good. "Thank you. Thank you. If you vote me, I am hot." What? "Taxes. They'll be lower, son. "The democratic vote for me is right thing to do, Philadelphia. So do." This doesn't make any sense. Well, then just say whatever you want. The battery's dead. It's gone. I gotta charge it up again. This one piece is makin'me nervous.
 You seriously need to stop touching me.
 This right here. Please stop touching me. This is really ridiculous. I'm stuffed in here like a jerk.
 Deandra, you look sensational.
 No, I don't. Just remember. Let Daddy do all the talkin'. Sorry I'm late.
 Jack Stanford.
 Frank Reynolds.
 This here is my daughter, Deandra.
 Hi. Hi. Well, I never like to keep a beautiful woman waiting.
 Oh. Thanks.
 You see, uh, Mr. Stanford I myself am a problem solver and you got a big problem on your hands. I'm afraid I'm not following. Check out the goods to my right. This pretty little lady is not only my daughter. She happens to be your biggest opponent in the election. Beauty and the beast. You're funny. Let the men do the work here, Dee. Now we can make this problem go away before it becomes a more expensive problem if you catch my drift. Are you trying to solicit a bribe from me? I don't know. Am I? 'Cause if you are not only is that illegal and highly unethical but you're doing it with the subtlety of a baboon.
 Let me take another approach here.
 I tell you what.
 What
 Why don't we discuss this over dinner? Dinner. That sounds good.
 I was talking to her.
 Look, Jack my little girl don't go nowhere without her old man.
 Isn't that right, sweetie?
 You're fired. Frank. Frankie, I gotta talk to you.
 Not interested.
 Look, man, I'm in a lot of shit here.
 So?
 I need to destroy Dennis. What do you have in mind? When Dennis Reynolds was a counselor at Camp Cumberland he was sent home for the statutory rape of a teenage camper. A vote for Dennis Reynolds is a vote for underage rape. Dennis Reynolds baby rapist. Don't let him rape you, Philadelphia.
 This is a goddamn smear campaign.
 You raped a girl? No, no. Okay. Rape? I was accused of Okay, statutory, first of all. Not I kissed her. She was a year younger than me. That's not even statutory or anything. What's the note say? All right. Yeah. All right. Uh, "Meet" Starts out "Meet," and then there's, like, other stuff. "Meet me in the parking garage. Frank."
 Yeah?
 Yeah. You clearly have a learning disability, dude.
 This is a trap.
 It's not a trap. Go see what he wants.
 It's a trap.
 It's not a trap! Make this thing go away. Okay. I'll get the master.
 Did you come alone?
 Yeah. Where'd you get that trench coat?
 It's cool, huh?
 It's very cool. That was a smart buy.
 All right, you got the tape?
 Affirmative.
 Okay, what's this gonna take?
 You and Dennis gotta bow out of the race.
 Not gonna happen.
 Gotta happen. Not gonna happen. I want that tape. I'm gonna need you to beg.
 Don't make me beg.
 You gotta beg.
 Seriously?
 Seriously. Down. Down. All right. I know what you're talkin' about.
 What do you say?
 Please, can I have the tape now?
 No.
 God! Come on, Frank. What's this gonna take? What the hell is that? Charlie traded me his whole collection of Garbage Pail Kids for the tape. Oh, my God. This is bad. This is so bad, man. These things, Mac You don't know how rare they are. These are rare. You can't find these. Bro, I am in some serious shit. I needed him to drop out. I don't care what you need. That is politics, bitch. I wanna tell you somethin'.
 I'm really glad you asked me out.
 Me too.
 How's that drink comin'?
 Strong. I should really probably think about gettin' something to eat. Yeah. Still got a little left there. Not for long. Hey, have mine. Oh. You're such a gentleman. Are you gonna buy me some food at some point? Or What do you say we get outta here?
 Oh.
 Who's the slut?
 Honey, this isn't what
 Another one of your whores? Who do you think you are Bill Clinton? You're a comptroller. Did he tell you he had a wife?
 Did he tell you that, you goddamn whore?
 No.
 Whoa! Whoa! All right.
 You bitch! Hey! Pour me a shot there, buddy boy. I got it.
 Oh, what'd you get?
 I got the smear tape.
 Oh, hey, man. That's great.
 Yes! Whoa. Sweet Dee. What the hell's goin' on with you? Screw politicians. Charlie, pour me a shot. No time for that. We gotta get back out on that campaign trail.
 What do you say?
 Oh, yeah. Hey, man, I was doin' some thinking about that.
 I don't wanna do that anymore.
 What? Oh, yeah. I googled "comptroller." Turns out that this guy's really just a glorified accountant. You know what I mean? And I hate doing math. It sounds like a ton of work.
 You know what I'm sayin'? I hate work.
 No. These guys, they make less than teachers. It's a
 So what?
 So I'm not doing it anymore.
 No. You have to run.
 No, I don't. Yeah. Yeah, you do.
 No, I don't.
 Yeah, you do. No, I don't. You're not the boss of me. I'm the campaign manager. You're fired. I traded all my Garbage Pail Kids for you. Well, that was stupid. Bit of an overreaction, don't you think? You look like a whore.
 Psst. You come alone?
 Yeah. Why couldn't we just meet in your apartment?
 It's not safe.
 Is that Frank's trench coat?
 Yeah. Pretty sweet, right?
 Totally sweet. Listen. I need your help. I'm in a lot of shit.
 I'm listening.
 I need to make Dennis disappear. Ah! Ah! That's what I'm talkin' about.
 Really?
 I was thinkin' that same thing, man.
 That's great. I know you guys have become close.
 Not that close. How do you wanna do this thing?
 If we use a gun, we're gonna need a silencer.
 A gun? Fine. No guns. Piano wire. Maybe we can use some piano wire. Look, whatever it is I gotta be the guy to pull the trigger on this thing. Retard. I'm talking about taking Dennis to Atlantic City for a couple of days until the election is over. What are you talkin' about? Atlantic City. That's good. Just take him down to the shore for a couple days.
 I'll take him to the shore. We'll go to Atlantic City.
 What's wrong with you? I give the guy my blood, sweat and tears, right? And my Garbage Pail Kids. And And he just drops right out of the race on me.
 Dennis dropped out?
 He dropped right out of the race. So I'm out my Garbage Pail Kid And, like If we used piano wire on him for a sec As long as we hurt him a little bit Sorry, Charlie. Plan's off.
 What are you doin'?
 I'm gonna go collect my money. Looks like you bitches shouldn't have fired me in the first place. Are you kiddin' me? Are you kiddin' me with that? I'm gonna buy myself a car. I am gonna drive as far away from this goddamn city Hey, Mac. Where you runnin' to? Huh? Goin' to visit your friend over at the union? What's goin' on? Is there a problem? I don't know. Phil, is there a problem? Conspiracy to solicit a bribe. Racketeering. I'd say there's a big problem. Your buddy over at the union came to see us recently. Told us about your interest in politics.
 He ratted you out, Mac.
 Apparently, you called him a nerd, Mac. Some people don't take kindly to that type of insult. Yeah. You're goin' away for a long time and prison can be a very unpleasant place for a good-lookin' young man like yourself. Oh, yeah. They're gonna tear through you like Kleenex. That is, of course unless you got something to make it worth our while. Are you soliciting a bribe from me? Sorry, pal. That's politics.                    
 Well, then what would you say?
 She's a quitter. You know what? I don't even care! And that proves my point. Because you don't care, you never succeed.
 Right. Failed.
 Failure implies that she actually tried to be an actor. Okay, I did try. It just didn't happen to work out. It's not your fault, sweetie. You're just not pretty enough. Oh, thank you! That's my dad, everybody!
 Great!
 Okay, I just killed three very large rats that were stuck in glue traps.
 Good work.
 No, no, that's not good. I am done with rat detail. That's by far the worst job in the bar!
 That's why we call it "Charlie work."
 No, dude. Not Charlie work. There's an emotional toll that comes out of this. I mean, you kill one of those
 Are you kidding me?
 What? What? You're blowing smoke directly in my face when I'm trying to talk to you.
 What is he talking about?
 If you want to smoke, you should have to take it outside.
 That's it. I'm done with this.
 It's a bar.
 Yeah. It's a bar, dude.
 Charlie, I think you're right.
 I think maybe we should ban smoking in here.
 What are you talking about?
 That's completely ridiculous.
 How is that ridiculous? There are smoking bans in a lot of states now. Uh, yes. And it's completely un-American. If you don't like smoke, then don't come into the bar. I work in this bar. I work here. But that's because you have the freedom to choose to work here. Smoking bans, they don't protect freedom. They strip 'em away from smokers. Look, I didn't go to Vietnam just to have pansies like you take my freedom away from me. You went to Vietnam in 1993 to open up a sweatshop! And a lot of good men died in that sweatshop!
 Oh, my God! You're out of your mind.
 Look, look. The point is that if Charlie took any time to study in school he would recognize that the Constitution protects my freedom to blow smoke all over his face. You gotta be You don't know shit about the Constitution, man.
 He knows more than you two un-American freedom haters.
 Thank you.
 Charlie, we hate freedom. Ew, we hate it.
 Hate it.
 I'm un-American?
 You're practically a Vietcong. Oh, is that right? Okay, you wanna talk America? You wanna learn a little something about America? Dee, let's roll out of here.
 Where are we going?
 We're gonna go America all over their asses! It is time for the truth! Five million people will die this year of smoking-related illnesses! These body bags, these represent the number of people that will die in this city alone today! It doesn't have to be this way! Let's make smoking history! Yeah! Yeah!
 Yeah! Yeah, man!
 Yeah. U.S.A., baby! Whoo!
 That's what America's all about, Dee!
 Yeah.
 Right here! This is the U.S. A!
 Oh, my God! That guy really knew how to pull an audience. I tell you what. Let's get in on this.
 Hey, bro. Great job out there, man.
 Oh, thanks. You really You had me like hook, line and sinker with that It was awesome, dude. It was awesome. So, look, I want in on the cause. Oh, okay. Just go to the Web site and you can check out No, I don't want to do that. I wanna be on the front lines like you, bro.
 I wanna be, like, you know, join the team or something.
 Naw, it's really complicated.
 There's a lot of red tape. You really can't
 Uh, excuse me, sir. But just what in the hell do you think you're doing? Oh, dude. This is just an acting gig. Like, I'm not really part of any cause.
 Oh, you're an actor?
 Mm-hmm.
 Oh. But not a real one?
 What the hell is that supposed to mean? No, just I mean, you're on the sidewalk. Oh, right. Like you know what you're talking about. How old are you? Like, 40? I live in New York, okay? Street theater is the only organized artistic expression that we have What a crock of shit, man! You're living a lie, bro!
 Dude, relax.
 Oh, relax? Oh, I'm gonna You're gonna throw with me? Little actor boy, you wanna throw with a patriot?
 Back off! Back off!
 I'm not 40.
 I don't need this.
 Get in your van. Get in your van and go, okay? 'Cause I'll throw down! I'll throw down any day of the week! Get in your little van and drive out of my face! Okay? Before I go America all over your ass! You know what? Screw Dee and Charlie. I'm sick of people telling us what we can and can't do with our own bar, you know? What happened to this country? Why can't we stay open past 2:00 a. M? Yes! And why can't we sell booze before noon on Sunday? These are the kind of puritanical restrictions that are killing this country. This is why people flock to places like Las Vegas and New Orleans and spring break. Because they're free to go wild. The girls go wild. The girls in Philly need a place to go wild.
 Right. New Orleans was washed away in that terrible storm.
 Tragic.
 We need to open up Paddy's as a haven for freedom.
 Yes.
 A replacement for the tragic loss of New Orleans.
 We should have gambling too.
 And we should have gambling too.
 Sure.
 I'm gonna get the ball rolling.
 Okay, great. We will open up Paddy's as the most American bar in all of America!
 A place with absolute freedom!
 With no gambling restrictions. Yeah, sure, whatever. Listen, dude. We should head down to sorority houses, right? Spread the word, you know? Hand out some leaflets or something.
 No, Mac. We should go to the library.
 The library? Why? Yeah, because at sorority houses you're gonna find nothing but tramps and whores.
 Those girls are already wild.
 Perfect! No, no. Mac, you're not listening to me. We don't want wild girls. We want real girls going wild. It's important to see the transition. You want to watch the process. Dee, what the hell is the point of this stretching? Charlie, if we're gonna put on our own demonstration then your body needs to be in tip-top shape out there.
 My body is in tip-top shape.
 Well, maybe for a small, fat person. Not for an actor.
 Fat person?
 A chunky chunky
 A chunky person? Where are you getting that?
 A husky person. Since when? Oh!
 Really?
 You know what? All right, forget it.
 I'm not an actor anyway.
 I know. Yeah. Well, then I'm a protestor, right? I'm a patriot. Give me that.
 Okay.
 That's my bag. What I need from you is for you to feed me some lines.
 I can feed you lines.
 And then I'll go from there.
 I just don't need all the
 I can take over.
 What do you want me to do?
 Let's focus on finding your breath.
 What?
 Where is your breath?
 In my mouth?
 No, it starts in your chest.
 You got to focus on your diaphragm.
 What the hell's a diaphragm?
 Right here. Putting your diaphragm
 No. The diaphragm is a
 No. Really? That's all you know?
 It blocks the babies out. Okay, yeah. That's what How'd you make it this far in life? Look, Dee, this is ridiculous. Let's just get out there. Let's speak the truth. Let's kick a little ass America style. We'll get all up in it! I'm trying to protect you. I don't want you freezing up out there.
 What? Freezing up?
 Yeah. All those people staring at you and judging you and-and-and-and not liking the stuff and talking about you.
 Are you serious?
 Yeah, I am. Your body could betray you
 in any number of ways
 Like how? You know, one of Locking up and maybe throwing up and stuff.
 Really?
 Yeah. You want to find your breath?
 Yeah.
 Yeah. It's in my mouth. One, two, three!
 Hey!
 Oh, my God!
 You girls have gone wild! You've gone wild!
 You went wild!
 You're wild! Way to go!
 You girls went wild! Nice. This is what it was like to have a bar in New Orleans, bro. Oh, man! New Orleans really had their shit figured out!
 Oh, they totally had their shit figured out.
 Yeah!
 Except for the levees.
 Right, yeah. Except for the levees. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, and the evacuation plan.
 Hey, oh!
 Oh! You've gone wild!
 You've gone wild!
 You've gone wild! You went wild!
 This is what America's all about!
 This is America!
 We have set up an American utopia!
 Yeah! That could be a bit of a problem back there though.
 Yeah, that could get weird.
 Yeah, it's really smoky. I didn't want to say it because of the spirit of this whole thing. But I think you're right.
 It's a little much.
 These fellows don't mess around. This is high-stakes shit. You think you can get one of these white broads to come over and do a table dance for Alan and the boys? No table dances, okay? That's what we were worried about. Listen, Frank. If you can keep those guys as far jammed into that corner as possible
 Push 'em into the corner.
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. Segregation! That's segregation! That's not what this is all about. America is a melting pot.
 But it might be good to set up some boundaries.
 Boundaries? Sounds like it's coming right out of Stalin's mouth. Stalin's mouth? That is not what we're talking about. We're just saying
 I don't know who Stalin is. Who the hell is Stalin?
 How do you not know? Listen, man. Just keep them under control. You betcha. Oh, here. They want you to play this Vietnamese music. They don't like what's playing here. Okay, listen. Compromise. Tonight we keep things the way they are. Tomorrow night, we'll play this shit. Good. I gotta get back there now because Alan is just about to bet his wife's glass eye in the next hand. Ladies and gentlemen, we are about to speak the truth. We're not gonna spout a bunch of words that are facts like some big jerk from New York who thinks he's great. We're gonna show you a dramatic interpretation. Hello, young man. I'm a bigwig from Big Tobacco. I work over here at T.J. Boris. Can I offer you a cigarette? Goddamn it, Charlie! Let's try and look at the bright side here. This music sounds like whales raping each other. It does. It does indeed. But the T-shirts are working. Isn't that amazing? You ask to see a woman's breasts on the street, you get slapped. You give her a free T-shirt and videotape it, and the clothes come right off.
 I love this country. Hey, yo!
 Yeah.
 Hey, sweetie. You want a T-shirt?
 Okay. All right.
 What? Why'd you stop?
 What's wrong?
 What's wrong?
 What happened?
 Whoa! Come on, pal!
 Dude.
 What are you doing?
 You're blowing up our spot!
 You're just standing there?
 Take a walk! Maybe it's time we set up some rules.
 We can't do that. No rules.
 Your father is killing our freedom!
 I know! I know!
 Hey. Hey, you still want that T-shirt?
 Yeah.
 Yeah? All right.
 Okay, any time you're ready.
 Okay.
 Oh, what? What's wrong now?
 Ruined again!
 Whoa! Jesus!
 Hey, man.
 I thought you guys were in jail.
 Parole. We heard you guys have a, uh, "anything goes" type situation here.
 Can we get a couple glasses of milk?
 What? No.
 No. You can't have milk.
 You can't have milk. No.
 Come on, man.
 Oh, for You know what? Get out of here. Could you guys go over there for a second? We gotta talk for a second. If you could just
 What are we gonna do?
 I did not see this coming. We cannot have the McPoyle brothers in here creeping everybody out. What if Charlie comes in here? He sent them to jail. They may be planning to stab him. They bang each other, Dennis. And they bang each other. They bang each other's All right, let's set up a couple rules. We'll set up a couple rules. Okay, guys, you can stay. But none of your weird shit. I don't follow. All right, listen. We've heard some things about you two. I'm not gonna get into the specifics. We just don't want it in the bar, okay? It's a free country, bitch. We may have a problem on our hands, dude. Do we have any sharp knives?
 What?
 These guys are maniacs. They wanna start bettin' fingers.
 Fingers?
 What are you talking about? If Alan loses this hand, he's gonna start chopping off his fingers.
 I've never seen anything like it in my life!
 This has gone way too far!
 This is getting ridiculous. Your friends, they gotta go!
 Bullshit! You are killing our freedom, man! This is what freedom's all about. I'm living on the edge. Okay, we're gonna find a compromise here, all right?
 Uh, we'll take the bar and you can have the basement!
 Yes! You want to put me in the basement?
 Yeah. You can do whatever you want!
 Anything goes in the basement!
 If I go in the basement, I can do anything I want?
 Anything you want!
 No holds barred? There's no limits?
 No limits!
 None.
 All right. I'll take the basement.
 Great.
 And now, if you don't mind, I'll take those knives.
 All right. Get the knives.
 Yeah. And use 'em. What the hell happened in here? Looks likeJonestown.
 Oh, look who it is!
 Come to join the party, huh?
 No. We came back to work.
 Oh, have you?
 I guess the strike's over, Mac.
 The workers have returned. Uh, I wasn't on strike, okay? I still need to make a living. What in the hell has been going on in here? And where is that music coming from? From the basement. Frank and the boys have been rocking all night long.
 Doing what?
 I have no idea. But I bet it's fun. We've had a line of 50 people outside every night. Yep. See, our bar is about fun and freedom. I don't know if you guys have ever heard of that. Freedom? Yeah. Stick around, bitches. You might learn something about the good old U.S. Of"A." Hey, Charles.
 Holy shit!
 How's it hanging? What? No! What? No! What are these guys doing here? Charlie, settle. Yeah, man. Chillax. We're cool. Bump it.
 No. I'm not gonna bump your Please go.
 No. Please walk away. Please walk away from me. Please walk away from me. Walk away. How could you do this to me? Okay, Charlie. We don't want them in the bar either, okay? But freedom has a price. The McPoyles are probably gonna stab me. If freedom has its price I can't believe you guys! You know what? Let me kick down a little thing to you that our founding fathers kicked down to me. It goes, "Don't tread on me." And right now you guys are treading all over me!
 Dee, let's roll.
 I don't want to go with you.
 What?
 Mm-mmm.
 You're my actor. I need you.
 But you're so bad at protesting.
 Come on, Dee. You're my actor.
 I don't want to go.
 Now you're treading on me!
 I'm not treading on you. Yeah, you are. You're treading on me. And you're not supposed to!
 I don't want to go.
 Are you kidding me? Is everyone gonna tread on me? Oh, my God. Okay. Okay. So you're still trying to be an actor then?
 Shut your mouth, Dennis.
 So now I can call her a failure.
 I am not a failure.
 Dennis, what is it that you call it
 when somebody tries to do something but doesn't succeed?
 Oh, yeah.
 Uh, that would, in fact, be a failure.
 Dee's a failure. Okay. You want to see some acting? You want to see some acting? Guess what. I am gonna act the shit out of somebody's ass. So here's the thing, Artemis. I know last time we saw each other things got kind of awkward when you licked my brother's face. But I need some help from an actor 'cause I've been doing this gig with my friend Charlie, and he is really bringing me down.
 Oh. Not everyone has the gift.
 Hmm. Want to smoke some hash? No. Thank you. So can you help me here?
 What's the venue?
 The sidewalk.
 I don't do sidewalks.
 Okay. See, that's what I thought. But then I realized if you think about it street performing, it's the last true form of organic artistic expression.
 Is that so?
 Yes. I think you and I need to get out there. We need to prove to the world that we still got it. Sweet, Sweet Dee it's not something you can lose, okay? Right. So let's go show the world. Is there any nudity involved?
 No.
 Can there be? No. I'll do it anyway. I don't understand this. McPoyles. McPoyles everywhere, dude. Girls don't want to go wild in this environment, not even for T-shirts!
 Hey, man. My sister wants to ask you something.
 What?
 She's mute, dude.
 Mute? Okay, what?
 She wants to show you her boobies.
 What?
 No! No! No!
 No. No. Trust me. They're top-notch.
 Goddamn it! Goddamn it!
 That is disgusting!
 What is wrong with you people?
 That's your sister! Hey, man. There's nothing wrong with us. We're just expressing ourselves. Society has the problem. Where do you keep your Pledge?
 Get out of here.
 Get the hell out of here.
 Go away. Go with your brother and sister.
 Take a walk. Dee, thank you so much for this acting opportunity. I can tell it is going to be a glorious performance. Those guys are full of shit, Artemis. There's not 50 people here.
 Focus, Dee, focus!
 But that's the reason why we're here.
 Those guys said there would be a big crowd.
 We'll draw them in. All right. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, please gather around. You're about to see an original street performance. Take yourselves to the foggy streets of London. The year is 1888. There's a killer on the loose. His name, Jack the Ripper. Two women walking alone home from a holiday cotillion. I say Get out of here! Get out of here!
 If you come to this bar, you're gonna get cancer and die!
 What are you doing? We're protesting the bar! Attica! Attica! Attica, man! Attica, man!
 Attica, man! Attica!
 What are you doing?
 Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, man! What are you doing?
 Tying off. No! No! No! Go tie off somewhere else!
 I thought we could do whatever we want.
 Give me the hose. Give me the little rubber hose. Whoa, he's got a knife! Okay, great. He's got a knife. Of course he does! Why not? You know what? Keep the little rubber hose! Good luck with that. Good life decision, man. Mac, I think we gave people too much freedom. Yeah, you're right, man. I'll call the cops. No, no, no, no, no. We can't call the cops. That's admitting failure. Dennis, we gave people too much freedom. That's the problem!
 All they do is exploit it!
 It's becomes anarchy. That is not what America is all about.
 No.
 I mean, America is Oh, my God! Yeah. Come on, Dee! Don't quit! Come on. We just rocked out there, Dee!
 Oh, we did? Yeah, we did.
 Don't be a quitter. Okay? I don't care. I don't want to act anymore. I quit. I want to drink.
 That's what I would like to do for the rest of my life.
 Don't give up.
 Why don't you leave me alone?
 Can you imagine an America where everyone just gives up?
 I don't care.
 Okay, great. Let's just give up!
 All right, Charlie.
 Have you come to gloat and shove it in my face?
 No.
 No, it's okay. You can. You know why?
 'Cause I give up. I'm living in give-up America now.
 What are you talking about?
 Will you shut up?
 Look at this! I'm gonna be a smoker too.
 You don't have to smoke, Charlie.
 No, we can. You know why? 'Cause we give up. We live in give-up America. I live in give-up America. We're living in America Hey, Ryan. How are you doing? Look, man, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but if you're not too busy showering in your brother's urine or plotting your revenge against me you mind lighting my cigarette? Thanks, bro. Hey, Liam. I'm sorry I sent you to jail, man. But any time you wanna stab me, it'd be really great for me.
 That's what you get, Charlie!
 Whoa, hey! Get the hell out of here!
 You get fork stabbed!
 Get out!
 Fork stabbed!
 Get out!
 And don't try to mess with us 'cause now we're even!
 Get out of here! Nobody messes with the McPoyles! Oh, you had to make a scene, Charlie! You had to run your mouth in front of psychopaths, didn't you?
 I just got stabbed with a fork!
 Whose fault is that, Captain America?
 Way to go!
 It's Dee's fault for quitting on me.
 Oh, it's Dee's fault!
 How is it Maybe it's your fault for being horrible at everything!
 Here we go with this again.
 Everybody pass the buck! Pass the blame! Dennis, we have to admit, it's over. It's done. We gotta get all of these assholes out of here right now. Dee, you get everybody out of the bar. Charlie, you're a disappointment. Come on. Let's go get everybody out of the basement. God only knows what's going on down there. I'll call the cops. Frank!                       Mac, you gotta see this movie, dude. Really? I thought it was boring. Boring? It's about the end of the world, Dee. Inconvenient Truth is not about the end of the world. It is about how if we don't stop global warming, we are going to destroy this environment. I think it sounds cool. I'll check it out. It is. It's awesome. Dude, come on. What the hell is that? What? Are you kidding me? What is the big deal, Dennis? What is the big deal? Are you nuts? It's like you see a movie, and now you're crazy about the environment. Oh, I'm sorry. Maybe I would actually like to do some good in this world, make a difference. You wanna do good? Yes. You can't do good. You're not good at that. I can do good. No. I am capable of doing good. No, you just screw people over for your own benefit. You guys are gonna be so angry when you look back and you see that the world looks at Dennis Reynolds and says, "Dennis, you are a good person. You are making a di" Holy shit. What? There's a baby in this Dumpster. What the hell is it doing? We gotta call somebody. Who? The police? The mother? I mean, think, Dee. Somebody threw this baby in the trash. We can't just put it back into the system. It is a terrible system. It's a horrible system. We live in a throwaway culture where everyone's just lookin' for the easy way out. You don't wanna carry your Big Gulp anymore? Throw it in the street. Don't wanna take care of your baby? Throw it in a Dumpster. I just can't take it. Charlie, you're harpin' on it. Well, I'm sorry. I'd like to know whether or not I share a bed with my father. I'm tellin' you, I am not your father. Then take a stupid blood test. I'm not takin' no blood test. It's so easy. It's a little prick Look, I've had enough of this. I'm not even gonna talk What the hell is that? It's a baby we found in the trash. Well, put it back. It doesn't belong to you. We're not gonna put it back. Well, give it to the cops. Get it outta here. It's bad for business. Oh, that's great, Frank. Pass the buck. Just passin' Everybody passin' the buck. You know, it's time we started taking responsibility for the refuse we're creating. Oh, my God, dude. Are you still harpin' on that stupid global heating movie you saw? "Global warming," Charlie. Yeah. Right. Like the earth is magically getting hotter. All right, stop! Clearly this is not the right environment for a child. I will take care of the Dumpster baby until we figure out what to do with it. Dee, you're helping me. What? No, I'm not. You see what's happening here? Do you see this? Family values in this country are going down the toilet, and it's because of people like you. Men and women raising a child together is a proven system a thousand years old. There are parental roles that need to be filled here, right? Otherwise, the kid winds up roaming the streets having unprotected sex with multiple partners Mm-hmm. Sharing needles and contracting the H.I.V. Virus, and it's all your fault. Are you happy, Dee? Is this what you wanted? You just gave this baby full-blown Al DS. What the hell are these scrubs doing, dude? They're activists, Charlie. They're sifting through the trash looking for recyclable materials. Recycling. What a waste. Frank, we are trying to make a difference. You see? He has no problem not callin' me "Dad. " Uh, hey, man. Where can I get one of those recycle bags? Get lost, narc. Excuse me? What we're doing is completely legal, so why don't you just leave us alone? Oh. No, I'm not a cop, man. I just wanna help out. Sure you do. I saw you pull up in that Range Rover. Is everything okay, Sage? Yeah. No, everything's fine. I was just explaining to your friend that I I want to help you guys out. Listen, bro. I know your type: Straightedge, mainline weekend warrior comin' down here in your cashmere sweater with your moussedup, hairsprayed coif. This isn't just a hobby for us. So why don't you take your phony, suburban, halfassed bullshit someplace else? I'll take that, hippie. Ah Hey, Frank Frank Fr-Frank Haha! Dude, do you believe this thing, man? It's a Charlie, Charlie, get down Dude, it's amazing! Look at this. Bro, you can chop a camel right in the hump and drink all its milk right off the tip of this thing, man. That is a find, man! That's spectacular. This is an Ali Baba sword, dude. Come on, you guys. Let's get out of here. Look, Dennis. Look at this. I don't care about that, all right? You guys are makin' me look like an asshole. I'm out here tryin' to make a difference, and you're over here rummagin' around the trash like a couple of narcs, okay? You can't just come down here with your mainline, cashmere, moussecoif hair spray and start bein' like a suburban tool. You can't Are you feeling all right? What are you saying? Did you even look at this? I don't know. I think I just got punked out by a couple of hippies. I gotta do somethin' about this. Goddamn, this Dumpster baby's heavy. No, no, it's good for your back. All right. So we got the diapers and the wipes and the powder. Shit, this raisin' babies is easy, huh? Huh? I think, first things first, the baby smells like trash, right? Throw it in the bath. Already with this? I didn't do it. Already with this? I come home to a crying baby? I didn't do anything. No, I didn't do anything. It's okay. Jesus Christ. You know what? I'm just gonna kick back, grab a beer and watch the Sixers, all right? You're not gonna help? You wanted me to do this with you. Would it kill you to go shopping once in a while? We're outta beer. Oh, we are? No, we're not out of anything, Mac, 'cause you don't live here. Wait One left. Nice. Great. Hey, if we're gonna raise this baby together I think it's important we at least try to make it work, so when you're done with the bath, why don't you go out and get some beer and, um, a pack of smokes would be good. We're not gonna raise anything together. I said I would help hang on to this Dumpster baby for a couple of days until we figure what to do with it. Really? Yes. You're gonna raise your voice to me right now? I'm not raising my voice. Well, I'm tryin' to have a rational conversation. I feel like you're berating me for absolutely no reason. So you know what? What? For the sake of the baby, we need some space. I'm gonna go with the guys, blow off steam. What? You're just gonna dump this thing on me and leave? You gonna guilt me into staying? Okay, I guess I have to stay for the sake of Dumpster Baby. But I will tell you what. I'm not gonna stand here and be berated. I'm going to bed. My God, I can't Charlie would you just please lay there and go to sleep? I can't sleep, dude. It's impossible. My mind's goin', like, a mile a minute. Well, stop thinkin' about it. I'm not your father. Now go to sleep. No. Dude, it's not that. I'm thinkin' about something completely different. It's the trash, isn't it? It's the sweet, sweet trash. I mean, man, we found some amazing shit out there today. The kind of shit I didn't think you could find in the trash, you know? And, uh, I'm just goin' nuts thinkin' about what else is out there. Frank, there's ordinary guys just like you and me goin' through everyone else's trash. They don't appreciate it. Ah, people don't appreciate their trash, Frank. Let's go get the flashlights. So I scale this tree. I mean, this is a big tree too, right? I get to the top of it. I find the nest. This is This is baby bluebirds. They're starving to death. So I regurgitate my lunch and I nourish the entire flock Wow. Like Well, well, well. Check it out, babe. The narc is back. Mmm. Hey, uh, Sage, I thought about what you said, and I think you were right, man. I was halfassing it. But I'm not gonna halfass it anymore. I'm gonna devote myself completely to the cause. Look, bro. Just 'cause you come in here with your Birkenstocks and your Phish T-shirt doesn't mean you're devoted. Means you're a total poser. Wow. Um Well, you know what, man? Uh, I'm just gonna go then, I guess. You know, I'll take my Birkenstocks and my Phish T-shirt and my kind bud with me. What? Did you just say you had kind bud? Kind bu Yeah. I mean, you know, I just have, like this much. Hey, and look at this. It's a little ray gun, like. Oh, that's nice, man. Look at this thing right here, dude. Put this in a plastic bag and, boom, shower radio, buddy. Oh, yeah. Oh, baby. Unbelievable. We're on a roll. Here's Look at this. We wrap stuff in this. Look. We can wrap it all up. All right. Electrics. Electrics! Whoa! A sneaker. What size? Fourteen. Throw it in the pile, baby. Crash in the pile. Ah, Charlie, isn't this great? We go right to the source! Forget about the dump. Yeah. Screw the dump, man. It's right in your backyard, dude. Yeah. This is it. What's that? What's that? What's that? It's another coat, man. Ooh, can I have it? No. Well, you already got one. Frank, use your head. This is the coat that's gonna protect my other coat. Come on, man. Oh, when you're right, you're right. Look at that. Yeah, baby. You'll find one. If you keep diggin', you're gonna find one of these. Oh, you gotta be kiddin' me. Huh? Oh, hello. Look who it is, huh? The girl who ruined my life by fallin' in love with my best friend and havin' sex with this guy right here. How you doin'? Gross. And "gross" to you. And you know what? I don't know what you're doing. I don't want to know. Go and do it in somebody else's Dumpster, okay? Yeah. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on a second. What do you got in those? Coffee cups and food scraps. Yeah, we'll take 'em. Hand 'em over. I don't know why it's cranky, okay? Well, maybe he's hungry. Your thoughts on nursing it? I haven't slept in three days. I don't have thoughts anymore. You know, raising a child is not nearly as fun as I thought it'd be. Well, what if we put it back where we found it? Oh, my God, that is the cutest little baby I've ever seen. What's his name? Uh, his name is It's D B. D.B. Oh, he could be a Gerber Baby. He could be in commercials. I have an idea. I'm three steps ahead of ya. We need to make Dumpster Baby a star. Exactly. This is exactly what I'm talkin' about. We can't put it back into a corrupt system. No. We have an opportunity to give it a real future here. Yes, by making it a star. And who have better lives than child stars? Nobody. Nobody. Rich, famous They have it all. The happiest people on earth. D.B., my main man, you got tossed into the right Dumpster. Brenda, I'm not gonna waste any more of your time than I have to. We've got meetings with agents all over town. Can you make D.B. A star? Well, I'm sorry to say, but in today's commercial world there's just no room for another white baby actor. There's an influx already. White babies don't sell. White babies just aren't selling right now. Question: Who is selling, Brenda? Well, the Latino market is the fastest growing demographic in the country. Great. So Mexicans are selling. Oh, well, D.B. Can play Mexican. Yeah. D.B. Could definitely be a Mexican. We get him some pistols. He fires 'em off like crazy. He does Do the jumpin' thing. He does the Mexican Jumpin' Bean. Watch this. Ayayay! We get him a little thing with chips. He could sell chips. And he can dip the chips into the nacho cheese. It's perfect. It's perfect. It's hilarious. For all we know, he is Mexican. 'Cause here's the thing. Tell 'em the thing. Oh, we've got Ooh, I Look. I can't really get into the specifics of the whole thing but we've got no idea who D.B.'s dad is. We don't know who the dad is. It isn't me. I'm sorry, but your son just does not look Latino. Oh. Well, I mean, that's a bit of a disappointment. That makes me sad. Yeah, because we're truly tryin' to give him a future. Is there anything that we can do? Well, not unless you can change the color of this baby's skin. Let me get this straight. You want to put your baby into a tanning bed. That's correct. I'm sorry. That's against the law. Look, pal, we are well aware of the law, okay? And we don't wanna jam you up here. We just wanna put him in there for a couple of minutes. Just to get a base. We'll sign whatever waivers. Cook him a couple of minutes, and we'll be out of your hair. I am feeling compelled to call the authorities. Oh, are you? Well, then why don't we take our business elsewhere? I sense some judgment in your voice, sir, and I don't appreciate it. You could have helped change this child's life forever. You chose not to. That's on you. I can live with that. Come on, D.B. I guess the road to stardom is paved with hard knocks and orange assholes. Trees are people too Save this tree These developer pigs are gonna tear down this tree. So tonight we will hold a candlelight vigil in protest. Hey, Sage, Asriel, can we commune for a moment? Yeah. What's up? Well, listen. I don't want to be putting out any negative vibrations or anything like that, but I think we're going about this the wrong way. Thanks, but, uh, we got it. Okay, why don't we hear him out, Sage? Thanks, Asriel. Well, listen. While I think lighting a couple of candles and singin' a few sweet jams sounds like a really good time it's not gonna stop a bulldozer. Somebody needs to step up and be a hero here. So I'm thinkin', I would chain myself to that tree and that way, if they wanna kill that tree, they gotta kill me first. That is so brave of you, Dennis. Is it? Wait. If anyone is gonna chain themselves to anything, it's gonna be me. But it was Dennis's idea. No, wait, Asriel. He's right. Maybe it should be him. Right. I'm the one in charge here. Right. You're the one in charge. Right. Right. Right. Mountain, go get some chains. No, wait. Hold off on that, Mountain. I brought some. Charlie, we gotta stop. We gotta stop. No. Two more stops, Frank. Let's keep it moving. Let's drop it off at base camp. No. No base camp. We gotta keep movin', Frank. March! No, it's fallin'. Ho! Do not lose that. Do not lose that. It's just a bottle. All right, I think we gotta stop. We gotta stop at the apartment. No, dude. There's no time for that, man! We gotta drop some stuff off. All right, fine. We'll make it quick. All right. Charlie, maybe we should get rid of some of this shit. What? Yeah. I mean What'd you say, get rid of it? Yeah. Frank, look at this. Huh? Yeah. This This Look at that, bro! Yeah. Yeah. This here's our future, man. People are just throwin' this away. Get rid of it, dude? Frank, we start gettin' rid of this, we're gonna be just like the wasters out there. Look Hey, guess what. Somebody else is gonna find it. Ah, you're right, you're right, you're right. Well, where are we gonna sleep? You sure you still wanna do this? Mountain, this is what it's all about: Me and my girl side-by-side savin' a life, bringin' in the dawn together. I mean, come on! Looks like it's gonna rain. It does look like it's gonna rain. Have you seen Asriel? No. Wonder where she is. Riders on the storm Tonight we cross the plane of reality Into the dimension of no place or time. Open your mouth. Become the journey. Like a dog without a bone What are we doin', man? It's pourin' rain out here! We're actin' like animals. But we gotta stick together, Frank, if we're gonna make it. Yeah, let's stick together. All right. Let's use our heads. What are we gonna do? We gotta get outta this rain. Yeah. Where are we gonna go? We could get in that Dumpster. I'm not above that. Let's go. Asriel! Where are you? Can you give me a bite of that, dude? Mmm. Yeah. I'm starvin', you know. Charlie, I'm really sorry that I banged your girlfriend. Ah, bro, you gotta stop talkin' about that, dude. I'm also sorry that I didn't get the blood test. But I know I'm a hundred percent positive that I am not your dad. Dude, how can you be a hundred percent positive, dude? How do you know? Your mother and I were gonna keep this a secret, but after we made love, she did get pregnant but she had an abortion. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Are you sure she went through with it, dude? 'Cause maybe she didn't tell you. I mean, she probably went right from the clinic and banged some guy and got knocked up because your mother was a giant whore. Ah, you know what, dude? I don't believe you, Frank, all right? It's hard to take. Just Oh, my God. You're a liar, man. Girl, you gotta love your man Where are you goin', Charlie? To find out the truth! Charlie! Make him understand Yeah Frank doesn't know the truth. I knew it. All right. You didn't have an abortion, you just told him you did. I get that. No. I had an abortion. It just didn't take. Wha What does that mean? It means, you survived it. You survived the abortion. What the hell are you talking about, Mom? W We went to one of those clinics one of those underground clinics because Frank didn't want to spend a lot of money Yeah. And I had the procedure, and then they told me you were dead Okay. And then three months later, you popped out, happy as a clam! Sweetie, I had to keep it a secret from Frank. I never wanted the abortion in the first place. But he was married, and I knew, if he found out, he would have forced me to get rid of you once and for all. He would have made me throw you in a Dumpster. Oh, my God. Nope. His skin needs to be darker, Dee. Yeah, I know. We're just gonna paint this bronzing lotion on him. Shoe polish. Shoe polish? Shoe polish. Shoe polish on a baby? You're such an idiot. That's gonna look stupid and smell like shit. We'll see. Where's D. B? My door's open! Did he get kidnapped? Somebody came in and took him? There's a note. There's a note! "Taked' baby. Meet at later bar, night or day sometime." Charlie. Feast your eyes on this! Oh, my God, Charlie. Where did you get a baby? I think you know good and well where I got this baby, now don't you? What the hell are you talking about? I'm talkin' about you and Frank throwin' your love child here in the Dumpster behind Paddy's Pub! What, did you think I wouldn't find out? Well, I did. Yeah. Yeah! What you might not know, though, is that this little baby of yours also happens to be my half brother. Charlie, the incident with Frank happened three months ago. It takes nine months to make a baby, so you can just give me the baby and stop screaming. You know, there was a time where I would've helped you raise this little Dumpster baby brother of mine like a son. But that's gone now, 'cause you ruined it! You threw your babies away! And you threw your swords away! You threw your golf clubs and your tasty treats! And you know what? I found them. And I'm gonna raise all of 'em! Get me the number for Child Services. Hey, Sage, buddy. How are you, man? How are you feelin'? Guh, I I did it. LI saved the tree. You sure did, man. You saved that tree. Wow. I gotta say, man, I'm really impressed. I don't think I could've done what you did here today. Guh, I'm a hero. You are. You're a hero. Yep. Guh Come here. Come here. Come with me. Man, it is a good day to be alive. It's a good day to be alive, isn't it? Okay, guys. She's all yours. You might wanna see this. I banged your girlfriend. What time did he say? Uh, "later bar, night or day sometime. " What does that mean? I don't know. Hey, any of you guys seen that Ali Baba sword Charlie had? What? The little shit dumped me in a Dumpster last night, and I'm takin' all his stuff. It's every man for himself. I gotta find that Ali Baba sword. Pour me a shot there, Dee. I am the man. Why are you so chipper? Well, I got punked out by this peace activist. So what I did is, I infiltrated his organization, I banged his girlfriend, and then I Hey, Frank! You recognize this young man right here? Interrupt me. All right. Or should I say, "Hey, Dad"? Yeah. That's right, everybody. Who would like to hear a mind-blowing story? Nobody. Give us back our baby so we can paint it. Oh, you're gonna paint it, huh? Well, be careful painting it, 'cause you'll be painting my brother. But I guess you already knew that, didn't you, Dad? What the hell are you talkin' about, Charlie? I'm talkin' about you and the waitress dumpin' your baby in a Dumpster! And the abortion that you tried to make my mom have? Well, guess what, Frankie. It didn't take. I'm an abortion survivor, Dad! I survived the abortion, Dad! Charlie! First of all, it takes nine months to have a baby. That is not my baby. Second of all, your mother is feedin' you a line of crap Holy shit. You guys kept the Ali Baba sword? Gimme the sword! That's the sword I want. Back off, man. It's my sword anyway Stop grabbin' it!                       There's no way a mouse could kill a scorpion. Dude, a mouse could kill It's got sharp claws and teeth. A rat could kill a scorpion. No shit, Frank, but we're not talking about a rat. We're talking about a mouse. If we were talking about a rat, it still would lose. A scorpion's this big. A little mouse fighting a scorpion, and that is final! Shut up! Shut up! Oh, my God! I don't care! All we're doing is arguing about the most stupid shit A rat. A scorpion. I don't care, man! When did this start happening? When did we start arguing all the time and fighting? This isn't like us! Look. We're working our asses off in this bar, and we're getting nothing to show for it and so we're starting to snip and pick at each other. And it's bullshit, man. 'Cause guess what. It's a beautiful day outside. Okay? We need to change things up. Let's go outside. Let's get some fresh air. Let's run around a little bit. You know? Let's just do something different. You know what, Charlie? You're right. This is great. Yeah. It's just nice to do something different for a change. Yeah. Enjoy a little blue sky, some fresh air. Yeah. Some, uh, earth beneath our feet. Yeah. See? I told you guys you'd like it. Yeah. It's goddamn bright out here. It's so bright. I can't use my eyes. There's people playing football right next to us. Like there's no room to drink. Tell you what. I would like to go back to the bar. Let's go back to the bar! Are you kidding me? Oh! Oh, look out. Let me see that. Can I get that back? Yeah. Go long. I'll toss you a wicked spiral. Want to just give me the ball, dude? We're trying to practice. What are you practicing for? I'm trying out for the Eagles. Uh, the Philadelphia Eagles? Yeah. They're holding tryouts for the public. Like in that movie, Invincible. Oh! Was that the one where the guy from the New Kids on the Block makes it onto the Eagles? I saw that. Yeah. That's the one. That's a good one. Wait. So they're actually doing that? Yes. Just give me the football. Okay. Well, Dennis, I think you know what we have to do. Dude, did you read this flyer? Donovan McNabb is gonna be giving us a motivational speech. I know, dude. We are actually going to be running on the Linc! Lincoln Field, baby! You guys think you're actually gonna make the team? No. Hell, no, we're not gonna make the team. But we will finally get to prove once and for all who's a better football player. That's right. Trying out for the Eagles is the best way to settle that score. You know what? I would like to join your little competition. No, no, no, no, no. You You You're a woman. Women can't do things like this. You'll get hurt. No. Women aren't allowed to try out for football. That's ridiculous. They should at least be able to try out. Well, there are plenty of other sports that women can try out for. Yeah. Like, uh, cooking and Complaining to your friends about your boyfriends. Yeah. Playing Playing at ballet. Cleaning. Displaying cars at auto shows in tiny bikinis. Yeah. When you get older, you can play bridge together. I don't know. You know what? I am in such better shape than both of you guys. Do you not think the first thing they're gonna do to weed people out is make you run? Oh, good luck. I could get so much further than both of you. You think that's even a possibility? 'Cause that could be very embarrassing for us. Well, we're never gonna have to find out because she can't try out. You can't try out! You're not allowed to try out. That is a rule, right? Check the rules. Okay. Let's double-check. We'll put a layer of beer, then a layer of ice What are you guys doing? Dude, we're gonna tailgate the tryouts. Oh, shit. That's a good idea. Oh, you gonna bust out Green Man, bro? No. No Green Man. What's Green Man? Well, in high school, Charlie was like our school mascot. A mascot nobody wanted. He'd get wasted and dress in this green spandex bodysuit. Spandex? It was really sad. That's it. You gotta bring the Green Man suit. Yeah, no. Done with it. The spandex. Green Man was good. It got me through some hard times. But I'm done with it. Tell you what. You can wear it if you want but I'm just gonna be relaxing, okay? This is gonna be about chilling out for me. No. This is gonna be exactly like Woodstock. Oh, is it? Are you planning on getting yourself locked in the bathroom of your cousin's Winnebago for three days? Shut up about that. I survived on hand soap and toilet water for three days. The memory haunts me. The Linc, dude The Linc Yeah, baby. I am actually gonna be able to look down and literally see how many yards I'm running. This is gonna be awesome, dude. We might actually get further in this little tryout than we thought. Yeah? See how many yahoos are trying out? Oh, yeah. I've seen a lot of people wearing capes. There are, like, 15 guys wearing capes. Why would you wear a cape? What advantage does that give you? Absolutely none. You know what? Have a little respect. We are here with the Philadelphia Eagles and they are opening up their doors to us. This is a boyhood dream. I know. I know. Why even come out here if you're not gonna take this somewhat seriously? I mean You done pissing yet? No. No. I haven't even started pissing because you're standing next to me, you're talking to me. It's making me nervous, and I can't do my thing. All right. Want another beer? Yeah. Give me another beer, for Christ sakes. I'm gonna sit here and not drink another beer? Yeah. Okay. Cabana is assembled. The grill is as sparkling as we're gonna get it. The margarita machine here is open for business. Time to relax. Want to drop some acid with me? What? You're dropping acid? Mmm. Woodstock, baby. Uh, okay. Well, no. Thank you. Uh, I believe that would have the complete opposite effect of relaxation for me. Well, I'm gonna trip balls. No. You messed up. It's too high. It doesn't look right on you. Too high? No, I'm good at it, dude. I did a good job on you. That's 'cause I have good cheekbones. You have good cheekbones? Yeah. That's 'cause you put foundation all over, bro. I put a light base on just to Hey, guys. What's up? What the hell is this? How's it hangin'? This is a joke, right? You think anyone's gonna buy that? Whatever, bro. You're gonna get crushed. Dee, the second any part of your body touches that field, it's gonna shatter like glass. You got bones like glass. I don't have bones like glass. You spent half your life in a back brace. Your body's, like, 90% scoliosis, Dee. Move it, fellas. Let's get on the bus. Bus? What the hell are you talking about? The bus that takes you to the field. Wait. I thought we were gonna be playing on the Linc. You think you dipshits are gonna play on the same field that champions play on? Where are we going? "Where are we going?" We're going to a shitty high school in Bucks County. Now get your ass on the bus. If I say it one more time If I say it one more time If I say it one more time Sprint to the bus. Sprint to the bus.

Half the reason I wanted to do this in the first place was to be out on that field. Hey, man. Stop smoking, will ya? Some of us are trying to make the team. Are you kidding me, bro? No. Guy, if you think you're actually going to make the Philadelphia Eagles, then you're pathetic. You're pathetic. No, you're pathetic, sport. No, you are You're pathetic! You're pathetic! You're the one who is pathetic! Whatever, man When I'm done with this tryout you'll go back to your sad, pitiful life and I'll be on the Eagles.

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Somebody get me outta here! Man, my brother just leveled your boy out there. He's gonna make the Eagles. Yeah, your boy's a pansy. But Doyle's a big strong guy. It's probably 'cause he eats all that fish. Is he just gonna talk at me? I am gonna lose my shit. What is going on with his head? It's too small or tight or something. Yeah, that's it.

A beautiful, beautiful gazelle person. My body is achieving a perfect symmetry right now. It's that long, lean muscle I've worked so hard to achieve. Hmm, I should've popped my shirt off. Goddamn it. Really should've popped that shirt off. I wonder if any women are watching from the sidelines. All right, Dee. You can do this. You can kick a football. You're better at sports than Mac and Dennis. Holy shit! The other coaches gotta hear about this. Well, well, look who's a natural. Guess I'll be getting further than you after all. Maybe it was a lucky kick. No. No. Those storklike legs they act like pendulums. And on the bottoms of those pendulums, feet like wrecking balls. We gotta do something about this, dude. Let's go talk to Frank. Come on. I got an idea. Somebody! Somebody help! Goddamn it! Goddamn it! Not again! Frank. Hey, Frank. Who said that? I'm Artemis. I'm Dee's friend. I'm trapped. I know. But I can help. Crawl into my mouth.

Can you give us a second, please? Whatever. I'm getting tired of watching him anyway. All right. Frank, listen. Did you bring your gun today? Great. Walk me through the plan. Awesome. The plan is, I get close to Dee. When she goes to punt the ball, I'll fire the gun. It'll startle her. She'll blow the kick. That's a great plan. Wait a second! How long have we been standing right here? Like two seconds. Seriously? Yeah. Frank, give me the gun. We're in a hurry. Where is it? It's in your hand. Wait, wait, wait, wait! When the hell did I put Green Man on? I don't know. That lizard talks! Where? Where? I don't like lizards! We don't have time for this. Frank, just give us the gun! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

Hey, guys. Could somebody please take me to the hospital, because I'm pretty sure I broke every single bone in my foot punting that football. Really? Yeah. I didn't make the Eagles, but I would like to go to the emergency room now, please. So your bones are made out of glass. Yes! Nice. No, my bones aren't Know what?

All our triumphs and our tales and We need to preserve our legacy. That's what I'm saying, bro! Our legacy! Our whole legacy here! So let's go out and make some friends, right? Okay, let's do that. But first Who wants to burn through a quick chapter of this diary? How's the ponytail look? It's ridiculous. Why I don't understand why you're wearing this whole getup. Bruce has never even seen you. Deandra, if we're gonna pull this thing off I gotta turn into a liberal yahoo just like Bruce. Now, when he gets here, I want you to hold my hand through the whole thing. I won't do that. Look. You've gotta stop thinking of me as your dad and start thinking of me as your fiancé, Seamus. Gross. Could we please try and think of a less creepy angle? But this is a grift. I mean, that's the way it is. You gotta stay in character all the time. As soon as you break character, you blow the grift. Hand, hand. No, I don't wanna touch you. Holding hands. Ah, damn it. Deandra. Ah, my little girl. How are you doing? Are you okay? Well, no, no. I'm I'm very broken up inside. Bruce, this is Seamus, my fiancé. I am also broken up. Mm-hmm.

She gave it to you. Weird, right? Yeah. Good news is it's all gonna go to help the less fortunate. Every penny. Oh, well, that is good news. It's a done deal.

Isn't that wonderful that we'll need to use our fortune that my mother gave you to shove at these kids! You know what I think? Huh? I think I know exactly what you and Seamus need. Can you sit tight? You just sit tight. Sit tight. I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Okay? Okay. Okay. Yeah. Is he gone? Yeah, he's gone. Burn these clothes. Tracy, cancel all my appointments. L It's time for my daughter and that idiot who raised her to learn a lesson. Guys, I don't know if I'm feeling this flyer idea. Really? It's perfect, dude. How else are three guys in their late 20s supposed to make friends? There's no system in place. A flyer does all the work. It does the work for us, man. All right, read back what we got so far because I don't Okay. "What up? We're three cool guys looking for other cool guys who wanna hang out in our party mansion. " It sounds a little gay. Yeah. It does sound gay. Right? You know what? Write, um, "nothing sexual. " Good. Okay. "We're three cool guys looking for other cool guys who wanna hang out in our party mansion. " "Nothing sexual. " Good, good. And add, "Fighters welcome. " 'Cause, you know, we want some tough dudes and some big dudes. I don't want a bunch of tough guys in here wanting to fight me. No, I didn't mean that. But it would be good to have extra protection. Yeah. Extra protection and All right. Well, uh, put "fitness encouraged. " Beautiful. That sounds confusing. Do you think so? I'll put, "Dudes in good shape. " Oh, there you go! That solves it. Nice. I like dudes in good shape. There we go. Okay. But we also need a guy who's funny and fat. We need a funny fat guy. We need a funny fat guy. Because every crew has a funny fat guy. Well, no. I'm the funny fat guy. So don't worry about that. You're not fat, dude. Yeah. You're also not funny. I want somebody who does observational humor. Oh, you know what? That would be good. Observational humor is cool. You know what, guys? I'm just gonna put "nothing sexual" again just to reiterate. Underline that. Please, please. Okay, clarity. Smart. Be very clear with that. And I'm thinking that the flyer should be in the shape of a beer mug. Hmm Too complicated. I don't like that. Yeah. Uh What about a bicep? Bicep. Yeah! A bicep. Bicep's good. A bicep would really do it. All right, let's go with a bicep. Okay. Yeah, what do we got? Here we go. "What up? We're three cool guys looking for other cool guys "who wanna hang out in our party mansion. "Nothing sexual. Dudes in good shape encouraged. "If you're fat, you should be able to find humor in the little things. Again, nothing sexual. " Underlined. Underlined. Okay. Great. I have no problem with that. No. Let's go meet some men. Lookin' good, bro. Lookin' very good. I'm sorry? Oh, your pants. Nice cut. You know, that vertical line on the side gives your body good length. Do you work here? What Nah. I'm just looking to meet some some new guys. I saw you from across the way. And I thought, yeah. This guy's got a good sense of style. He's about the same age. Got a nice crop of blond hair. We could definitely use a blond in the crew. Mix things up a little bit. Here. Why don't you just, uh take a look at that flyer there. Is this a penis? A penis? No. It's a It's a bicep. Oh. Yeah, yeah. Oh, right. "Party mansion. " Exactly. Yeah. Cool. Yeah, I'll swing by. You'll swing by? Yeah, sure. Okay, yeah. Just come by the address. We'll be there partying. Sure. Yeah, at the party mansion. You're gonna be perfect, man. Yeah. Nice. See ya there. I should give him more for his friends. Yeah. Oh, son of a bitch! Penis? No. It's a a bicep. Bro. I just had the most perfect blond guy slip right through my fingers. I mean, I had him in the palm of my hand, and then he was gone. You know what I mean? I mean, this guy would've been perfect for you. What's up with this beefcake? Is he coming to the party or what? Big time. Great. Nah, he didn't read the flyer. No, I read the flyer. He didn't understand it. I understood it perfectly. Oh! Okay. Okay, we need to take a second look at this flyer. Uh, yeah, dude. Guys! Check out who I just met buying a crossbow. This dude is the shit. I shall use this crossbow to pierce my broken heart. Yeah. All right, dude. Dude, isn't that guy awesome or what? He's like a poet. That guy's not awesome. No. Dude, do you know how hard it is to find a passionate guy like that these days they don't make 'em anymore. You should've seen how passionate he got when I showed him the dick flyer. You knew? You knew that it was a dick? Well, yeah. I thought we changed it. I thought you guys were changing it. It was always It was always meant to be a bicep. It was a bicep, bro. Well, then why did you cut it like 'Cause it looks totally like a dick. I thought, all right, let's go with the dick thing. It's more masculine anyway. Good point. I mean, shit If you want it to be a bicep, it needs more veins. I can't wear this. I gotta go home and get another costume. Come on. There's no time. Just sit down and shut up. And wait for Bruce to get back with the money. All right. But I can't promise that I'm not gonna go berserk if he tries to give me Al DS again. He wasn't trying to give you Al DS. Jesus Christ! You're the one who's goin' on and on about staying in character. Yeah, you're right. You're right. Look, we can do this, okay? We just have to go along with whatever he throws at us. We're so close to that money. Yeah. Yeah? I'm not gonna blow the cover. Good. Pull your shit together, Seamus. All right. Surprise! These are some of my adopted children. Go ahead, guys. This is your new home. Ooh, Mac. Here come our guests. Come on. Okay. Okay. How did you get these guys again? Oh, they're college kids. I just went down to Penn. I reeled them in with a couple of white lies. Put your game face on, buddy. We got a legacy to preserve. Okay. Here we go. Welcome to the party mansion, bitches! Get your asses in here! Look at that shit, huh? Yeah! Where is everybody? Where are all the chicks? Guess what. It's just you and us. That's right! We got the party mansion to ourselves! There ain't no rules in the party mansion! That's right. Check this out, bitches! Whoo! Oh, yeah, baby! Nice one! Let's stop being pussies, and let's funnel some beers! Let's funnel some beers! I don't really drink. Wrong answer, bitch! You're a drinker tonight! That's right. You guys are gonna be telling stories for the rest of your lives about how crazy we are! Oh, yeah. You're gonna tell everybody how we're like those guys from Jackass. How we like to smash stuff and shove shit up our asses. That's right! You are gonna get so much shit shoved up your ass tonight, four eyes! Yeah! You're gonna be talking about this night for the rest of your lives! "Dear Diary, the dance was a total disaster. "I cried myself to sleep again last night. Oh! "Mom forced me to wear the back brace. And all the school chanted "aluminum monster!"' Oh Oh, man! "Aluminum monster. " That is hilarious. No! Oh, it's not hilarious! I share this little girl's pain. Have you ever been scorned, Charlie? Uh, like all day, every day, dude. Then you should think of this little girl as your soul mate of pain. Oh, shit, bro. Babysitting a bunch of orphans was not part of our grift. Yeah. Well, it's either that or digging up Mom which, for the record, I am still very into. But I'm willing to do whatever we need to do to get this money, Frank. Okay? If we need to adopt a couple of orphans, fine. We'll get the money, and we'll take them back. Oh Can you do that? Is that possible? I don't know. I'm sure they have some kind of a return exchange policy. That sounds good. Great. Now this one's sad. Give Give her some money. What? Frank, give her some money. I'm not giving her shit! What are you talking about? May I speak to you two in the kitchen? Oh. Yeah. Yeah. You two have such a great vibe! I'm ready to write a check right now. But I just want to make sure that I'm helping you to have, like, the best relationship that you can so that these kids have a loving, stable home. And I know that this may sound a little weird. But I have a lot of training in family therapy. And I think for me to help you I need to observe you at your most intimate. I need to observe you two making love. Uh Uh How long's your boy been passed out, bro? I don't know. A couple of minutes. I'm just worried he's gonna wake up before we throw him down those stairs. You kidding me? Look at him. He's gone. Man, he's out. You're kidding, right? You're not really gonna throw him down the stairs. Oh! We should throw him off the roof! Right? Great idea, dude. I'm the thrower. That's fine. Why are you guys doing this? That's what friends do to each other, bro. No, it isn't! Guy, his mom just died. Can you have a little compassion? My mom just died, all right? The least you could do is let us throw your buddy off the roof! "I'm totally gonna tell Eric how much I like him tonight. "Even though Danielle "was like all over him today in school. "Mother said, "Don't bother. He wants a pretty girl instead. "' I can't stop crying, Ernesto. Hey, me neither, Charlie. Oh, but don't fight it, Charlie! No! It is all part of the healing process. So tell me, how do you two usually begin your lovemaking sessions? That's hard to say, you know? Because we start it in so many ways. Seamus, perhaps perhaps you should start by, uh, kissing her neck lightly. Uh, no. No, because, uh, we don't kiss. We don't kiss. At all. No kissing. Mmmmm. That's unusual, but okay. Okay. Just tell me w Just tell me what you are into. I like to watch. So I'm gonna bounce off the bed and observe. Okay. Okay. See You see what just happened, Dee? Seamus has just communicated what turns him on in a healthy way. Heh. So Yeah. Perhaps now would be a good time for you to pleasure yourself for him. Hmm. Then eventually Seamus will mount you. Okay. You know what? I'm gonna have to stop this. Really? Uh, yeah. Yeah? I'm gonna come clean here because we've been lying to you. Deandra Deandra, just No. Think about what you're doing. No. You know what? I'm sorry. We've been lying. And the reason is Think we haven't had sex yet because we're waiting until we get married. We're waiting. We're saving ourselves. We're saving ourselves! Saving ourselves. It's so important to me and to him Yeah, we couldn't do it. To do that. Yeah. Right. And I And I And I think that maybe that's what the tension is that you're feeling. It's all sexual. Oh, it's so sexual. You know, I'm also a licensed minister. So why don't we just do a wedding? Like do it tomorrow? Hmm! Because I've been thinking about it. And I should never give the money to an unmarried couple anyway. Okay. Okay. Family and friends, we're gathered here to to share in the declaration of a lifelong commitment between this man and this woman. Deandra, do you take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband? I do. Seamus do you take this woman to be your wedded wife? You bet ya. Well, then by the authority of God and the laws of the great state of Pennsylvania I now pronounce you man and wife. Congratulations, Deandra! You made me so happy. Yeah. And you just married your daughter, Frank. You know who I am? Of course I know who you are. You're the little asswipe who raised my children and turned them into animals, into monsters who who lie and steal and take advantage of people and contribute absolutely nothing to society. Make sure you're getting this. Yeah, yeah. I can't believe Ernesto's missing this! He's gotta see it. Go get him. If you knew who he was, then why did you do the whole ceremony? I was just trying to push you two to your limit. But apparently you you have none. So I I hate to interrupt. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Uh, Bruce? Can you Can you just pronounce them man and wife again? I wanna get that in a close-up. Again? You wanna Do the thing where you're like, "And, yes, of course I know who you are. " And you were getting so angry, Bruce. Oh, yeah! Bruce, can you make 'em kiss this time, though? Yes. Uh, sure. May I May I see the camera for just a second from this side maybe? Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh I'm gonna take this and give it to the lawyer, and you're gonna lose the house because, uh, you violated the conditions of the will. Frank was not to set foot in the house! Bruce, come on, man. D Dad, be cool, man. Like, let that slide. You are acting like a real bastard, Bruce. That's ridiculous. You're the most horrible people alive. Oh, come on. Oh, that's a little bit going overboard. That's a lot. That's a lot to say. Come on. Don't be like that. Now I'm gonna lose the party mansion. Thanks a lot, Frank! Whoa, guys! Guys, where you going? Whoa, whoa! Hey! How did they get free? Oh, come on! We were just having a little fun! You guys still wanna be in our crew? I don't think so. I don't think they're gonna go off and tell about our great adventures and our glorious triumphs. It doesn't seem like it. No. Well, at least we still have Ernesto. Yeah, whoops. No, no. He robbed your house. Oh, son of a bitch. Yeah. Ah, I'm sorry that the grift didn't work out, sweetie. We could still go get Mom's jewelry. I'll get the shovel.                     Gimme the walkie. I'm having a hard time understanding what we're doing. Just gimme the walkie-talkie. All right. Why did you hide your will in the ceiling? I didn't do it. Charlie did it. Well, why did Charlie hide your will in the ceiling? Because I didn't wanna crawl around these goddamn vents. Gimme my gun. Oh, right. Yeah! I don't think you should be carryin' this thing anymore. It always gets you into trouble. Recently, it has occurred to me that Dennis and Deandra stand to lose a lot of money because they're not my kids. They're gonna rub me out. I feel like you're being very paranoid about this. If you just go to a lawyer, you can draft up a new will, no big deal. Don't over think this. Trust me. Give me the goddamn gun. Here. Now, you think you can make sense of Charlie's map? Because it's dark as a well digger's ass up here. Frank, no one understands the subtleties of Charlie's retardation better than me. I can guide you right to it. Then you will be handsomely rewarded. I like that. Shit! Seal me up! Seal me up! That's them. Get away. Get in. Just get in! What I say is the law. I'm the boss of both of you now. What are you talking about, man? Why are you standing like that? 'Cause I'm your big brother, dude, and I'm the boss of you. Where is this coming from, man? You are not our big brother. Yes, I am. So get me a beer, little bro, before I give you a serious noogie. Dude, I swear to God, if you try and give me a noogie I will yank your underwear over your head so hard, your asshole will rip in half. Heyoh! What's up, bitches? Mac, can an asshole rip in half? Like tissue paper. They behind us? No! Lock the way out! Whoa, whoa, whoa! What the hell are you guys doin'? Whoa! Okay. Okay, don't shoot, okay? Just take whatever you want. Take the cash register. Take the girl. "Take the girl"? Don't argue with them. Just go. You better go with them. But they're not trying to take me anywhere! Don't try to be a hero. Do what they say! They're not saying anything. Well, what's the sense? If you keep arguing with them, then we're all gonna die! We don't want the girl! Then take the cash. We don't want the cash! Well, then what the hell do you want? We're takin' you bitches hostage. That's right. And we need a gassed-up boat, and we need 100,000 clams in a briefcase. And a And a Planet Hollywood jacket. A leather one. Reversible. And we need a-a reversible Planet Hollywood jacket too. Can't believe this is happening. Taken hostage by the McPoyles. We should just bum-rush 'em. Hey, I'm the one making the demands here, pig! If they're not met in one hour I'm gonna kill one of the hostages! In one hour, we're gonna have Margaret shoot one of you in the face. And if any of you try to escape, we'll massacre you in a blaze of glory then play with your bodies. Especially Dennis. Let's secure the perimeter. You hear? I think he means it. There's no way they're gonna get those demands. They can't get a Planet Hollywood jacket. Those places don't even exist anymore. They don't make those jackets. They'd have to call Stallone, and he's not gonna give his up. Maybe Aykroyd. Shut up! We need to focus, okay? This is serious. We could get Stockholm syndrome. Oh, my God. What is that? Does that start with a sore throat? Because I think I might be getting it. No, you're not getting it. Are you a doctor? You're qualified to tell me I'm coming down with Stockholm syndrome? Stockholm syndrome, it it messes with your mind. You start to empathize and then side with your captors. We could turn against each other. Dee is right. Now look, we need to watch out for each other, okay? The only way we're gonna get through this is if we stick together. Nobody has to die. Somebody has to die. Oh, yeah. Doesn't have to be one of us. No. Mac or Charlie, right? I mean, what do they have to live for? Not one thing. So, we need to form a pact. No matter what happens, you and I have to stick together. You and I will form an alliance. We'll form an alliance. Dennis is gonna try and have you killed. I can't say that surprises me. No, he's gonna sell us all down the river. Okay, should we kill him first? Look, I don't want anybody to have to die but if somebody does, there's no reason it shouldn't be Dennis. It should be Dennis, right? He had a great life. Yeah. Sure. He had a full, full, good ride. Oh, a fantastic ride. I had a terrible ride. Charlie, you had the worst ride. You deserve another shot at the ride. I want a better ride. Oh, you oughta ride and ride. So listen. Here's what we do. You and I No matter what, we gotta stick together. We gotta stick together. We should get to Mac, though, before Dennis does. Oh, Mac will be with us. Mac will be with us. Frank, Frank. Come in, Frank. McPoyles have taken us hostage. They're threatening to kill us. It's too late for the guys, but there's plenty of time to save me. So come down here and get me out of here. Where the hell have you been? I've been lookin' for you for 20 minutes. I'm lost as shit up here. The McPoyles have taken over the bar, and they're threatening to kill one of us. Come save me! Holy crap. Forget about the rest of them, Frank. They're all gonna perish. It's just me. There's still time to save me. Get down here! Not until I get that will. Once that will is safe and secure, I'll come and help you. Will? There's plenty of time to do that. We can do that some other time, dude. No. This is all the more reason to get that document. Who the hell knows how it's gonna shake out down there? Everybody gather round! I gotta go. I'll call you back. Ow! Son of a All right. There's absolutely no way they're gonna meet all our demands, so you guys are gonna dig a hole straight through the wall to the next building. We're gonna go to the roof and escape by helicopter. Here's how it's gonna work: Two of you are gonna dig while two of you rest, and then you switch. I volunteer to rest first. Bullshit. You can't volunteer to rest. You can be on my team if you want, but my team rests first. I called it. Right, great. It's settled. I'm on your team. We'll rest first. Charlie and Mac, you dig. You're gonna be on Dee's team? Some loyalty, bro. You don't wanna be on my team? Easy. I never said that. I feel like the syndrome's making you all paranoid. It's making me crazy, dude. Hold on. Oh, my God. He's burning up. Sit down. You gotta sit down. Oh, God. I'm getting sick. Guys, clearly Charlie's comin' down with a nasty case of Stockholm syndrome. The last thing you need is a roomful of sick hostages. So, guys, do you mind if I grab a couple of beers? I feel we would be a lot more relaxed if we had some beers. Oh, and a cooler! Get a cooler. We're gonna want to keep the beers cold. Good idea, Charlie. Uhuh. What the hell? The cooler's gonna keep the beer cold. How are we gonna do that without a cooler? I would appreciate a cold beer. We should probably all have a cold beer inside of a cooler. Who drinks warm beer? Let's take a vote. All in favor of beer and coolers Great. Then it's settled. Charlie, go get a cooler. Don't move, Charlie! No beer. No cooler. Margaret, put your hand down. But your sister agrees with us. She's on our side. She's a deaf-mute. The only reason she raised her hand is 'cause you guys did. Really? Let's try that again, right? That's awesome. Hey, I wonder what else we could get her to do? Uh, let's blink really fast. Oh, come on. That's awesome. All right! Put your hands down and stop blinking! Leave Margaret alone. You two, in the bathroom. You two, grab some shovel. Ryan, crank up the heat! We're gonna get this place hot and clammy Just like the McPoyles like it. Ah, here we go. Charlie, what are you tryin' to tell me? "If here by now "then bad place be. "Trouble time for you when heat comes. " Jesus Christ, the kid's an idiot. Wha Wha-What? Oh, shit! What, uh What's Damn, man, they're really crankin' that heat, huh? Yeah, man, maybe that's why she dressed in that. Oh, of course, that's why. They're gonna stay all nice and cool while we get all hot and steamy. Why are you covering your mouth? So she can't read my lips, dude. I don't want her reading lips. Her? She can't read lips. You don't think? No way. Here, check this out. Do you understand what I'm saying? No? Can you understand the words I am saying? Do you know what I am saying? You can't read lips, can you? Right. All right, Charlie What was that? There's something I gotta talk to you about. Yeah. Help me out with this map. Whoa! What are you doing with my map, dude? Frank gave it to me. He's up in the vents. He's gonna try and retrieve his will. If I guide it to him successfully, he's gonna give me a very large percentage of that. He thinks that Dennis and Dee What are you doing? It's boring. I'm getting bored. You should be paying attention, Charlie, because this could be very good for you. Come on, come on. You're losin' me. Oh, my God. With Frank dead, the will gone, Charlie gets all the money. I get all the money? What money? The inheritance money. Okay! Go! Good! Good! Do you understand what's happening? Kinda. Do you understand what's going on with this map? Yes. Okay! Now walk me through it. We'll go through numbers later. It's a fake map. It's a decoy. Really? Yep. Where's the real map? The real map is tattooed on my body. Get outta here. Where? Right here. You can't be serious. Oh, I'm dead serious. This is impossible. It's very possible. Dude, I'm not looking in your butt. You have to, dude. That's the only way to find the will. All right, but you gotta swear not to tell anybody. I swear. I can't see anything. Look closer. What do you see? Nothing. What do you smell? Oh, my God! Really? You fart in my face? What do you think? Are you kidding me? Why would you do something like that? Why? 'Cause you stole my map, and Frank's in the vents! You're lyin', we could die, and I never got to fart in your face before! We don't have time for this! Where is the real map? That's the real map. There's no fake map, idiot. Jesus Christ! Are you kidding me? This is just unbelievable. How could anybody like it this hot? I feel woozy. Ah, this is bullshit. A couple of glasses of milk lukewarm, skim for the lady. We don't want your milk, Liam. Then start breakin' bricks, wet nips. You know what? I think you're full of shit. Is that right? That's right. I could walk out, I don't think you'd do anything. I don't think you're serious. You don't think I'm serious? No. Oh, you think I'm bluffin'? You're bluffin'. You think I'm bluffing? You're bluffin'. Then bluff this! Ryan, stab somebody! Oh! What have you done? Give me the milk. Showin' 'em we're not bluffin'. No, you're supposed to stab one of them. You stab one of them! Oh, I gotta take care of this. Owww! Holy shit. My bad. Oh, my Oh, my God. That is one of the most terrifying things I've ever seen. I mean, that must have taken so much heart you know, to stab your brother like that? I mean, that is real dedication. Mm-hmm. What? Whatever, okay? Look, I think we need a real plan here, Sis. The hour is coming upon us. Oh! Look, maybe I can corner one of them and manipulate them. Get inside their head. And have sex with them. Mm-hmm. Have sex with them? No. I was gonna say, pit them against each other. What? I know. What? Well, what did I say? You said No. Oh, God, no. Those guys are disgusting. Dee, I think you're startin' to show signs of Stockholm syndrome. No. I'm fine, all right? Can we just focus here, and just tell me what the plan is? Yeah, let's focus. Okay, here's the plan. All right, look. I know I can get the girl to fall in love with me. Okay. Now I'm not one of the members of her family I got that goin' against me but I do have a secret weapon. Boom. All right? I just need to get alone with her and let the pecs do the talkin'. One thing'll lead to the next. She'll lead me secretly to safety. Mac, what's with the goddamn heat? I'm roastin' like a suckling pig up here. Oh, yeah, man. It's gettin' pretty hot up in this piece, huh? Must be miserable up in those vents, Frank. Charlie, is that you? Yeah, it's me. Hey, are you lost? I warned you never to go up in those vents without me. Uh, yeah, a little bit. Hey, Charlie you think you could give the walkie-talkie over to Mac? I gotta talk to him privately. Yeah, hold on a second. Yo, buddy, I'm here. Mac, go somewhere where you're alone. Okay, Frank, we're alone. Whatever happens, make sure Charlie's the first one to die. What? Why? Because of this will business. He stands to gain the most. That's a very good point. That's an excellent point. All right. Uh, that's a good plan, Frank. I'll get back to you in about 10. All right, get back to me. 10-4. Okay. Well, I think it's pretty clear what we should do. Frank has to die. Gotta kill Frank. Gotta kill him somehow. So once the McPoyles take out Dennis, Dee and Frank Yeah. Then you and I will split the money right down the middle. Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh. That's kind of a lot, don't you think? I'll tell you what. I'll give you 25%. Twenty-five percent? Charlie It's my money, dude! Hey, ball sacks, put those on. Why? It's too obvious who the hostages and who the captors are. We're gonna confuse the cops. All right. Your time is almost up. And we thought we'd spice things up with an immunity challenge. The team who wins will be exempt from the first round of shootings in the face. Oh, well, that's a great idea. Dee, shut up. What the hell is she talking about? She's got Stockholm syndrome. No, I don't. No! I just think it's a good way to decide who to kill first. I'm tryin' to put myself in their position, you know? It's called compassion, dickheads. Maybe if you guys had a little bit of it, you wouldn't be in this mess in the first place and then we wouldn't be standing here tryin' to figure out which one of you we have to kill. But that's where we are. So hand me that shotgun 'Cause I'd like to do this mess myself. Get on your knees, bitches! What are you doing? Now you're on their side? You wanna be a McPoyle, trash bag? Huh? Mmm! If you wanna be a McPoyle, you've gotta earn that the hard way. And you will learn that later on. But for now, the challenge is this: Whoever can destroy more things on the inside of this bar wins. And the teams have changed. It's now Dee and Charlie versus Mac and Dennis. You have one minute to plan your strategy starting now. Whoop. Come on. Come here, come here, come here! I think I got a plan to get us out of this. But I need you to do the destroying thing. Can you? I'm a great destroyer. Are you kidding me, dude? You're a born smasher. Yes! I'm a born smasher. I'm gonna work a different angle with the girl. Work those pecs. Yeah, exactly. Bump it. All right. Dennis. What? I love you. Go! Go! Go! Okay, okay. I got a plan actually, okay? Okay. I'm gonna start by wrecking the back office. The back office? Charlie, I feel like there's a lot more stuff Hey! Listen to me, okay? I don't blame you for that betrayal, but you're acting nuts. All right, listen. I'm sorry about that whole thing Shut up, okay? I'm tryin' to save your life here, Dee. Listen, I'm gonna save your life by wreckin' that back office. We gotta stick together, okay? You got it? Yes, I got it, Charlie. Time's up, assholes. Start smashing! Mm. Mmm. I love you. Decided to come in here and take a break from all the excitement. It's got me all sweaty. So sweaty. Do you mind? Margaret, you like sweat, don't you? It is "Margaret," isn't it? Of course, it is. You know, your eyebrow It drives me crazy. It's so thick. It's so dark and so very connected. You're a stone cold fox, Margaret. You're a stone cold fox, and I want you. I gotta have you. I need you. I want you inside me. But you know that don't you, Margaret? Yeah. Look at yourself, Dee. You've turned into a monster. Huh? Not my fault. I'm sick. I know, Dee. I know. You're the one that first told us about Stockholm syndrome. But I feel like, if you just snap out it there's a chance that we could survive this, if we just stick together. Whoa! All right! Time's up. Looks like Mac and Dennis take it. Nice! Blast away, boys. No! No, wait. Wait, because Charlie Charlie destroyed the office! Go by and look. Charlie saved my life! No. No, blast her! Charlie, we did it! Blast her! Damn it. We did it! Goddamn it, Charlie. Frank, Frank. Come in, Frank. Oh, when we get outta this I am gonna shove my fist right into your ass, hard and fast not in a sexual way in a "I am pissed off at you" way for turnin' off your walkie-talkie and leavin' me in this shit hole! Listen to me very carefully, Frank. Charlie has escaped. Repeat, Charlie has escaped. I think he's gonna come after you, man. Don't worry about it. I can take care of myself. Ah! God! I just stepped in glass! There's broken bottles all over the place. Broken bottles everywhere? Oh, shit, dude. I think you're in Charlie's "bad room. " What the hell is that? It's where he goes to be alone and break bottles. Dude, you gotta be real careful. He's gonna find you. I can take care of myself. Hello, Frank. I gotta call you back. Be careful. Be careful. H-Hi, Charlie. Lookin' for your will, Pop? That's exactly what I'm lookin' for. You know, it's funny what kind of men we turn into in circumstances like this. I heard who you wanted to have killed. But that goddamn Mac, he Then tell me, Frank. What do you think about this? I like that very much. That's exactly why I came up here. No, it's the Oh, yeah. I guess it is. Now let's get the hell outta here. No, I don't think so, Frank! You see, I don't need you anymore, now do I? What are you talkin' about? What are you doin'? Put your hands down. Yeah. Yeah. Charlie, put your hands down. Charlie, don't Bye, Dad! Oh, my God. Do you carry that everywhere now, dude? That's ridiculous. Lead me the hell outta here. All right. Fine. How? This way. That way? Put the gun I was gonna go that way. That would've been wrong. All right. That was, uh nice. That was very hot and sweaty and passionate milky. Now let's get outta here. Let's sneak outta here, you know, and start a life together. Let's get outta this crazy place together. Come on. Let's go. Sneak me out. What? Wha No. No-no-no-no-no. No. We're done with the kissing part, okay? That' part's over. We're in love now, and you can sneak me out of here. We're at that part now, all right? No. No-no-no. Oh, God. Please tell me you understand what I'm saying. Do you understand me? You don't understand, do you? This has all been for nothing. What the hell is goin' on here? Uh, nothing. Doesn't look like nothing. But for the record, I'm into it. Everybody to the roof. It's time to pay the piper. A couple of hundred more yards and we're outta here. A couple of hundred more yards? That's it. Push! Go! We're, like, in a tomb, Charlie. I'm one of you guys, though. I'm I'm a McPoyle now, so you wouldn't kill me, right? No! She's got Stockholm syndrome. Don't listen to her, okay? She'll betray you. I'm the one that won the immunity challenge the one that should live. Actually, we both won 'cause we were on the same team. So we're both safe. No, I did all the work. You were in the bathroom getting laid. I I love inbreeding! I like men in tight, white underpants. Uh Get on your knees! Goddamn it! We're free, dude! We're free! Frank and Charlie! Frank and Charlie came to save us! They're gonna save us! Right? Uh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, okay. We came to save you. Yeah. Yeah, we came here to, uh, save you guys. Yeah. That's exactly it, why we came. No, we came to, uh, save you, so here we are. Frank. Liam. What a delicious surprise. Looks like we got ourselves into a bit of a pickle here. Get over with your friends. I don't think so. Really? Really. Yippie-kayyay, Mr. Fuckin' Brother! God! Ah! Ah! I love you! God, I love you! Hang on! Ow! Don't let go! I got you! I got you, brother. Oh, no, you don't! Whoa! What are you doing? Ow! Stop! Why are you doin' that? Nooo! Are you all right? Yeah. Think I might get a bruise on my heel. That's not bad. No. It's not really bad at all. It's pretty fun. It's like, ah! Why don't you guys climb down that ladder? All right. Later, bitches. "Later, bitches"? What? Wait. So they're just leaving? Why are they leaving? What is happening here? This gun is rubber. Rubber gun! It's rubber? She's right. It's rubber. There's no police! There's no police down there, dude! What the hell is happening? What is going on here? Are they just screwin' with us? Where are the cops? Haha! Revenge! We got you, suckers! Nobody messes with the McPoyles! Whoo! Haha! Eat it, douche bags! Whoo! Whoo! McPoyles! Goddamn it!                       That's a good shirt, Charlie. I like it. You should buy that. You like it? Yeah. Okay, stand a little to your left, please. Why? Dee, just a little bit to your left? Why, Charlie? So I can steal it. No, you're not gonna steal it. Just buy the shirt. Dee, it's fine. It doesn't even have, like, the exploding ink thing on it. We're good. Oh, great news. I'm not getting arrested with you. So buy it. What is the point? The point is that you have, like, four articles of clothing. And that's it for years and years and years now. So buy something new. All right, first of all, this place is a rip-off, okay? Secondly, someone should teach these people how to do a decent hem, don't you think? Oh, are you unsatisfied with that hem? Very unsatisfied with the hem. What do you know about hems, Charlie? I've been sewing my clothes back together for, like, almost my entire life. I know a thing or two about a hem, Dee, all right? Well, that's just sad. Well, it's not sad. It's a very valuable skill set. So, you know Just try the shirt on and buy it. All right. Shut up! Shut up! Dee Reynolds? Yeah. Ingrid! Nelson. From high school. Ingrid Nelson? Yeah. You look so different. What happened to all of the fat parts? I lost 'em! I lost a ton of weight! Wow! And look at you. You look so beautiful. Aw. You don't have that hideously ugly, disgusting back brace anymore. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, God! We were such losers in high school! Mmm. Do you remember what people used to call us? Uh, I don't remember. The Aluminum Monster and Fatty Magoo! Yeah, that was it. Remember? Yeah. Yes. You were the Aluminum Monster! I was Fatty Magoo! Mm-hmm. Yes. Yes. Hey, do you remember how you used to say that you were gonna be famous and have your own clothing line? Did I say that? Oh, my God. Every day. Every day, it was "famous actress this" and "famous model that. " And all the kids did was laugh at you. That is a good memory. Well, no. I mean, it inspired me. I thought to myself, "If the Aluminum Monster can do it, then so can I." Oh! Dee, you're in my store! This is your store? Yes! Wow! All this, yours? Yeah. Gosh! Hey, so, did you ever do any of the Are you a model now? Are you Did you Well, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah? Not-Not-Not Yeah. Not right now because I'm shopping. Did you go to law school? Oh, my God, I did! You did? Yeah, for a little while. I loved it. God, you must be so busy. I'm so busy. So busy that I have to go. But it was really excellent to see you. Oh, it was so good to see you too. Oh, and congratulations. I would love to hang out. Hang out? We're gonna hang out! We're gonna do that! We're gonna do all of that! Okay. Charlie. You're not gonna believe this. Hmm? I just ran into the biggest loser from my high school. And she owns this store! Really? I used to say all this stuff about how I was gonna be big and famous to keep her down. Oh, yeah. But it did the opposite. It, like, inspired her or something, which is terrible. I'll tell you what. Calm down. Here's what you do, all right? Pop on a couple things, slip 'em on, we'll walk right out of here. No. No, that's not good enough. I gotta beat her at her own game. Charlie? Mm-hmm? I got a fatty to take down. Dee, how's your design coming along? I can't believe you stole that shirt. Come on. I steal lots of things. You don't have to get all huffy about it. Let me take a look. No. It's not ready for looking. Let me take a look-see. I'll tell you if I like it or not. Charlie, I'm not ready. What are you guys working on over there? Dee's designing a dress to put her old nerd friend back in her place. Oh, which nerd friend? Um, the fat one. Ingrid Nelson. Ingrid Oh, Fatty Magoo? That's right. Oh, your old sidekick. What's she been up to? Well, she owns her own, like, clothing store now, right? So Dee's making a dress. I'm gonna help her sew it. Because according to Dee, I'm a loser too. Did you know this? But, Sweet Dee, being a winner's not something that you can become. It's something that you're kind of born with. Like me. Like us. Like me. All right, let me take a look at this. No, hold on. Let's just peek at it. I feel like you're gonna make fun of it. It's not done yet. Dee, when did What is this? Is it a boat? Oh, no. No, it's It's a boat with a triangle in it. It's not a boat. No, there's a cup and a straw. Oh, it's a It's a cocktail dress. That's a strap. Is it a raincoat? It's not a raincoat! Oh, no. That's a plug. It's a light bulb. Well, in my head, it's very It's elegant. It I'm having a hard time putting it out onto paper Yeah. Through your hands? Have your hands been smashed with hammers? What is wrong with you? Smashed with hammers? You're definitely not gonna be putting anybody in their place with a drawing like this. Let me give it a shot. Dennis, take a stab at it. I'm gonna start with the breasts. Oh, naturally. Come on! Oh, those are beautiful. Bountiful. Gorgeous, right? I would say so. Oh, yeah! You see? Okay? That is some good Then we move on to the waist. Yes. Delicate, precise. Damn, dude, you can draw. I'm getting kind of, like, a little flustered here. Yeah, well, that's understandable. She's a nice looking lady. I'll tell you what, dude. How about I take this sketch, right? And then I talk to Frank about, you know, a really good sewing machine. And then I whip up a prototype Oh, of my designs? What? You dick! Charlie, come on! I thought we were a team! Relax. I'm still gonna help you make your raincoat with the straw on it. It's not a raincoat! What is this? This woman doesn't even have a rib cage. Doesn't matter, Dee. Because winners always win. You're not a winner. You're not a winner because you used to be popular in high school. But I think you peaked. Peaked? Peaked, Dee? Mmm. Let me tell you something. I haven't even begun to peak. And when I do peak, you'll know. Because I'm gonna peak so hard that everybody in Philadelphia's gonna feel it. I'm in my prime. And I bet you that I could sell these dresses to Fatty Magoo just based on these sketches alone. And your loser friend is gonna buy 'em because she's a fatty. And that's just the way of the world. All I have to do is turn on my winning charm and Fatty Magoo will be putty in my hands. 'Cause us winners always win. He wasn't talking about you. I think he was. It's too streaky. Where? Everywhere. Fix it. Well, I'm trying, Frank! I've never spray-painted a chair before, okay? Why are you covering your mouth? Because that lead paint is extremely toxic. What? Is that why I'm feeling so dizzy? Hey, all I'm hearing is excuses. And I still have a blotchy chair. Wait a second. Wait a second! What am I saying? What am I doing here? You're making my chair look like it was dipped in gold. Now get back to work. Nobody is stupid enough to think that your chair was dipped in gold, Frank. Why am I helping you? Because I'm manipulating you. That's the way I get people to do things for me. Really? Yeah. Shit, that's awesome. How did you do that? Yeah. If you make my chair look really nice, I will tell you. Deal! I got you. Oh, great. Oh, good, good. Excellent. I need to use your business connections to see if I can get a really cheap sewing machine. Why? Dennis and I are gonna make a dress, see if we can sell it. You're gonna go in the garment business? No, dude. I'm not going into the garment business, okay? I'm just gonna make one single dress with Dennis. Who's gonna run the operation? It's not an operation, dude. Look, I just want your help getting a sewing machine. Whoa. Wait. Has that chair been dipped in gold? So we would cinch it up nice and tight through the waist giving a nice, subtle lift to the top of the dress and keeping those fat tummies in check. Gorgeous. Okay, Dennis, I'm confused. Why's that? These are just pictures of women with giant breasts. Yeah. And in some of these sketches, the women aren't even wearing clothes. Yes. Well, why? Listen, let me level with you. You're an attractive enough girl. I mean, certainly you've got some potential. All right? There's no reason for you to be so nervous around me. Why don't you just order a couple of my dresses and maybe if you're lucky, I'll even make one special just for you. And if you look good enough in it, hell I might even consider having sex with you. How does that sound? Terrible. All right. Let's just calm down. You're having a reaction. That's understandable. It's the nerd in you talking. Why don't we start over? How many of my dresses would you like to order? None. Not one. I'm not gonna take "no" for an answer because I just refuse to do that because I'm a winner. And winners, we don't listen to words like "no," or "don't," or "stop. " Those words are just not in our vocabulary. I know what you need. You need to see my dress on a model. I'll tell you what. I'm gonna come back tomorrow with a model. Please don't do that. Save your breath, Ingrid. Those words have never worked on me. I'll see you tomorrow. Look, I am so confused. Why does she have light bulbs growing out of her neck? Light bulbs? What? Those are shoulder pads. What? Yeah. You know what? I'll walk you through it. No. I don't even want to Why don't you just help me make Dennis's designs? Because Dennis's designs are terrible. I enjoy them. I know you do. I walked in and saw you enjoying them very much this morning in the bar. This again. I told you I was scratching myself, Dee! You were scratching hard and very vigorously. So No. 'Cause that's the only way I can It must've really itched. All right. All right, fine. What is this thing? That is Dennis's prototype. Be careful with that. No, I know it's the prototype. But I don't get how it works. You're asking a million questions! All right, look. I'm just gonna have to walk you through it, all right? So pay attention. Yes. Thank you. The pretty lady gets naked, of course. And I help her into the prototype. My hands sort of guiding along her body, making sure that it fits properly. Now the dress is starting to look fantastic, you know? And she feels very excited. She feels very sensual. And I feel very sensual about her because she looks so good. And then, you know, we chitchat a little bit. No big deal. But she asks me back to her place. Where did that come from? I accept, you know? And then, you know, we chitchat at her place. It's no big deal. But eventually she says, you know, "Do you want to make love, Charlie?" Oh, God. And I say, "Are you serious? Because yes, I do. " And then just, boom, we're into it. And it's hot and it's passionate. Charlie? Then it's just me and you, babe, all night long. Oh, my God. Charlie? And I satisfy her so many times, she starts screaming my name. Charlie? Charlie! "Charlie," she says. "Charlie," she says. Charlie! Jesus! Dee! What are you I thought you had walked back over No, I've been standing here the whole time! I was in the middle Are you gonna help me with this or not? No, I'm trying to What are you doing? 'Cause you're looking pretty Oh, Jesus. I'm gonna do it myself. I gotta say, Frank, I'm really happy about this partition. I can't tell you how many memories this brings back. Yeah? This is exactly the way I ran my sweatshops. Is it? Yes. You have to separate them from us. Right. They need to be trained. Right. Okay, yeah. I got an idea. Trained. I got an idea, okay? I want to play music in there. Yes? 'Cause I think it'll keep them happy and motivated. And they'll work harder. No, no, no, no, no. Mac, you gotta break 'em. You gotta break 'em like dogs! Break 'em! Yeah! Break 'em like dogs! You want to learn about manipulation? Yes, yes. This is it. All right, here. Your first rule of manipulation is you gotta show them who is boss! You gotta rant and rave and yell at people! Then they find their place. That's it. Everyone gather around. I have an announcement to make! Dennis has an announcement! Go. Now's your chance. Now's my chance. Rant and rave. Gather around. Everybody, gather around, please! We're all standing here. Is this everybody? Is this everybody! What are you doing? Dennis has an announcement! Yeah, I heard that. I'm wondering what it is. It's an announcement! What's up, Dennis? I have an announcement. Oh, my God! What is it? Quiet on the floor, please! Dennis, your announcement? Thank you. I think everyone will be pleased to learn that we have just received our first order. That's amazing! Hooo! I can't believe they placed an order before they saw the prototype. Believe it, Charlie, 'cause that's what just happened. What the hell did Fatty Magoo like about your sketches? Shut up! How many did they order? Twenty-five. Twenty-five? That's right. Charlie, do you have my prototype? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, do you have any more of those sketches? Maybe like one where the lady's, like, looking right at you? Stop talking to me. All right, everyone. I want those dresses. Now I don't care how you do it. Just make it work. You heard the man. Make it work! You heard our designer! Ladies and gentlemen, back to your stations! Let's make it work! No! No, I'm not going to make it work! I'm designing my own clothes! I'm supposed to be the one who's beating Fatty Magoo! Mac, take care of this. Okay. Dee, can I talk to you for a second? Look, I know what you're trying to do. You want to show this girl what's what. I get that. And I think if you just buckle down and join the team Mac, I'm gonna stop you right there. First of all your breath smells like an old lady fart passing through an onion. Secondly, I know you're trying to manipulate me. And it's not going to work. Get your hand off my shoulder because I've got a fatty to burn. She's gonna be here any minute. Can we get this thing tighter? Or can we lift these up a little bit? Oh, my God! Are you sure this is the right size? The dress is the right size. I wish we could say the same thing about your body? My God. What did you eat? The entire kitchen cupboard today? What's wrong with my body? So many things. I mean, your breasts, they're tiny. Your gut is huge. I wear a "D" cup! Well, you're just lying about that. All right now, take this gut and suck it in. What gut? Suck the gut in before I scream. How did you get into my office? Ah. Well, how does anyone get in anywhere, Ingrid? A little hard work and persistence. Did you kick in my door? I intend to kick down a lot of doors today, Ingrid. Now, you're gonna have to use your imagination a little bit because my model is a little on the side. But tell me what you see. Well, I see a man committing a felony by breaking into my office and destroying my property. I also see a very confused and uncomfortable model who seems to be stuffed into an ill-fitting garbage bag. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, mum, mum. I see what you're saying, yes. You're saying that you love the dress but you hate this model. She hates the dress, you freak! Silence your mouth! She cannot properly see the dress because your disgusting body is ruining it! I can't believe I let you see me naked. Well, that was part of the All right. I'm calling the police. No. No, no, Ingrid. There's no need to call the police, okay? Because the only crime that's being committed today is the crime of ugliness. And sadly, you can't press charges for that. You know what? I'm just gonna have to come back next time with a model with a perfect body. You've been a disappointment. Shame on you. No, no, no. Shit. Look at this. Beyond our wildest dreams. Everything working out, huh, Mac? This is brilliant, Frank. It's going smooth. How you doing with Charlie? Did you break him like a dog yet? Almost. I've changed his diet to only dry food. And he's no longer allowed on any of the furniture. Good. What about Deandra? Hmm, not so good. She's still causing problems. Hmm. You're gonna have to take care of this right away. Oh, goddamn. Dee! Come on! Just go straight! Dee, come on! I feel like it's broken or something. It's not broken! You're just messing with it. I'm not messing with it. You're punching in and you're Don't stomp on the pedal like that! How do these people Who are these women? And what are they They're Eastern European women! I have no idea where Frank got them. They're very good sewers. You should ask them how to sew. Okay? They smell like sausage. They do smell like sausage. It's terrible. Charlie, shh! Dee, I need a word. Get outta here. What are you working on? It's my dress. You know that. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Did we not have a conversation about this, Deandra? The dress does not fit the prototype. I don't give a shit. Come on, Dee. Don't rock the boat here. Charlie, I can handle this. I'm on your side here, man. I'm just trying to say she Charlie, sit. Don't tell me to sit, dude. You want a treat? I think I got some jerky here I do have some jerky in my pocket. Do you want some? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah? You sure? You want some? Yeah. Wait for it. Sit. Shake. Speak. I would like some jerky, please. Good boy! He caught it. He catches it every time. You want a piece of jerky? No. You're supposed to be a goddamn modeling agency and this is the best you've got? I mean, I ask you to send me models who are attractive. You send pictures of girls that have bodies like Oompa-Loompas and hippopotamuses! I can't talk to you people. I can't How hard is it to find an attractive model in the city of Philadelphia? I mean Heyoh! Guess what, buddy. We did it! We filled the order! What order? The dresses, dude Yeah. Just, uh, put 'em by the door or something. Okay. Hey, you want me to help you bring 'em to the store? No! No, I don't want you to ever go to the store ever! Why not? Something wrong? No. Everything is great. Everything is perfect. Then why don't you want me to go to the store? 'Cause you're busy. I'm not busy. I actually have a pretty clear docket for the next couple of No, you're so busy. Because we just got another order. We did? For how many? Uh, a hundred. A hundred? We got an order for a hundred dresses? Oh, my gosh! That's fantastic! Ooh. Mmm! We gotta kick it up a notch. Dee, come here! Where the hell have you been? It's only 9:00 in the morning. Oh, my God. I've been here since 5:00. What? Dee, things have changed around here. They're running this place like a concentration camp. We shouldn't even be talking right now! I think you better sit down and get to work. It's bad. The situation is bad! Oh, my God! They're watching us, Dee. They're always watching us. What do you think they're saying out there, Frank? I don't know, but I don't like it. The German war propaganda was a nice idea. Wait till you hear the steam whistle. Charlie, where's my dress? Charlie, I left it right here! Where is it? Please don't do this. Did you do something with my dress? What did you do? Where is it? Just go back to work. Tell me where it is, you son of a bitch! I'm not supposed to say! You want to lose your hand, Charlie? I'm not supposed to say! Tell me where it is! Tell me! Is that a steam whistle? What the hell's going on over there? Everything's fine. What happened to my dress? It was destroyed and the materials were distributed amongst the workers. What? You guys! How could you do that to me? I worked forever on that dress! The dress did not fit the prototype! It didn't fit the prototype! Screw the prototype! What are you talking about? Now I have to start all over! I'm afraid not, Deandra. We're gonna have to let her go. You heard the man, Dee! Get off the floor! Oh, my God. Off the floor now, Dee! You know what? Ladies! We're outta here! No. We don't need this! Let's go! We got a whole box of knockwurst up there. A big pot of it! Deandra, what are you doing? I'm staging a strike. Let's go! I'm pulling it again! No, no I'm pulling it again! Back to work! You can do it, Dennis, because you're a winner. You haven't peaked. You haven't even begun to peak. But you're gonna peak today. Oh, you're gonna peak all over everybody. Make it work, Dennis. Together forever and never to part Together forever we two Make it work. And don't you know I would move There she is! Dee, what what are you doing? I'm having you arrested for slave labor. Slave labor? Yes. What the hell are you talking about? You bought some dresses from my brother, Dennis that were made in a sweatshop in the basement of our bar. Do not listen to a word this woman says! She is stark-raving mad! She's a goddamn lunatic, okay? Those dresses were made by voluntary laborers who work for us on their own free will to feed their starving families in their home countries! In a sweatshop! In a sweatshop! Not a sweatshop. It is a sweatshop. No, a working factory! Which makes you the biggest loser, Fatty Magoo. I didn't buy anything from your insane brother. Really? What? Really. So let me get this straight. Dennis has been lying to us the whole time? I don't know and I don't care. Wait a second. Fatty Magoo. Are you Ingrid Nelson? Yes. No shit! I'm Mark Dunlap. I knew you in high school. Wow! You look terrific. Thanks. And that would make you the Aluminum Monster. Oh, man! You were all jacked up, huh? I don't remember. Remember that? With the back brace. And all that metal. And you were like You were like an aluminum monster. Thank you. That really was the best name for it. The only name for it. You were so cute. Oh, thanks. It was a lot of metal, man. Hey, hey, I used to know your brother. Now, he was a pretty cool guy. Whatever happened to him? Behold a winner in all his Oh, shit. What are you guys doing here? Together forever and never to part Together forever we two And don't you know I would move heaven and earth To be together forever with you Together forever and never to part Together forever we two And don't you know I would move heaven and earth To be together forever with                       You're definitely gonna get this on. You ready? Uh, yeah. I guess. Okay. He knew that if the gooks were to get their hands on the watch, they would take it. So he shoved it up his ass! I have no idea what you're doing. Why, it's Christopher Walken! It sounded like Rosie Perez or something. Come on! That was a perfect Walken and it's gonna win me the talent show. What talent show? The one I throw for the pub crawl. Are you doing that again? Mm-hmm. Yeah, well, it's not really a talent show anyway. She just gets the most untalented people in Philly to enter the competition so she can win it, and then she never wins it anyway. No. Last year she got smoked by this chick who ate, like, 50 hot dogs in three seconds. That was amazing! That was not talent. Guys, guys, guys! I got some news! Some terrible news! We got a huge problem. Can we stop for a second and talk about this? What? What's with that jacket? I was gonna wait on that. I think we should go over the jacket now. No, let's hear about it now. First of all, it's not a jacket. It's a duster. It's like a jacket only it's longer, thicker and far more badass. I look like Lorenzo Lamas, and women find it irresistible. Well, that part's just simply not true. Either way, I like it. I bought it with the money I was gonna make at the pub crawl. Here's the problem. You know that Korean barbecue joint down the street? Mr. Kim's? They just signed up for the pub crawl. Which means now they're the last stop! They can't be the last stop. We're always the last stop! That's the only time of year we make any money! They're also experimenting with a secret microbrew. Word on the street is that it's delicious and powerful! Bullshit! Yep. We're the microbrew guys! They can't take that! Wait. You guys have a microbrew? Yes! We make a delicious, amazing microbrew! Really? Oh, it's amazing. They-They throw all the skunk beer into a trash can. And then they sell it for $10 a glass. The point is we cannot let these Koreans steal our thunder! They wanna make a top secret microbrew We gotta make ours more powerful! Right! We'll make it so strong that people will pass out and vomit and vomit in their own pass out. They'll never leave and go to Kim's in the first place! Yeah. I will make this year's talent show the best talent show ever. Let the men talk, Dee! Let the men talk! What are you saying? We're in the middle of an emergency here! Guys, we gotta move on this. It's the damn North Koreans! Damn North Koreans. Wait. Wait a second. What makes you guys think they're North Koreans? That's the bad Korea. They're the sneaky, bad Korea, man. The ones on the top and they sneak down and they eat everybody's pets. I can't stand it! It's un-American! All right, goddamn it. That's it. They're gonna take our way of life from us. It's bullshit. Okay, gang. Let's solve this North Korea situation once and for all. All right, that's enough. No, no, no, no. That's enough moonshine, Frank! No, no, no, no! Look, we don't want people to go blind! You can never have enough moonshine. Goddamn it. Trust me on this. I know what I'm talking about. How's it taste? We gotta lace it with somethin' sweeter. We gotta add a little sweetening. Oh, Deandra. Could you be a darling and run down and get Daddy some antifreeze? No. We don't want to kill people. You're not getting this. I can't help you guys. I have a very busy day. I'm auditioning people all day. And also, you're not my dad. Winning a talent show that you throw for yourself is just about the saddest thing you've ever done, Dee. Listen. If this is all about boosting your self-confidence why don't you go out and bang a bunch of random dudes like you did in the good old days? This talent show's very important to me. All right? And I'm not gonna let you guys steamroll me like you always do. Why don't you get Charlie and Dennis to help you? Well, Dennis and Charlie are out collecting intelligence, okay? Oh! You're playing spies now? Intel is the name of the game, Dee. It's all about the intelligence! Then you picked the wrong two people. Maybe so. But we do have a secret weapon. That would've been a lot better if I was wearing the duster, dude. Come on, dude. It doesn't fit you. It's too big for you. That's why it's so awesome on me. It's like, "Why's that guy in a giant jacket? Why do you take this away from me? What is he hiding, dude?" I just wish you'd let me do it. Can we just snoop around a little bit? We can snoop around. But I just I should be wearing the duster. That's the bottom line. No, I'm wearing the duster. That's the end of it. Fine. We should drink a couple of these microbrews. Let's get some microbrews. That's what people on the pub crawl are gonna do. Yeah, I know. Two microbrews, please. All right. What is this? "Pub Crawl Karaoke Contest"? Uhoh. Bro, "Prize $500"? That's not good. Aw, shit. Look at that bracket. Do you think that's That's what that's for? Oh, that's for the karaoke contest, bro. Oh, my God, dude. There's a lot of names on there. That's huge, man. That's gonna Bracketing is a very intricate and difficult thing to do, man. They got it down. I gotta get this intel back to Mac. Well, don't Hold on that because we want to try the What? The microbeers? Yes. Here we go. Thank you. Thank you. Mmm! Oh, shit. Goddamn it. That's good. That is really good. That's That is Mmm! Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Son of a bitch, that's good. They're putting somethin' in that 'cause you can't just make beer like that. What do you mean? Like they're enriching it? Are they enriching the You cannot They're enriching the beers, Charlie. They're enriching their beer. That's definitely enriched beer. That's an enriched beer, dude. That's not conven I've only tried enriched beer like once, I think. They're not allowed to have the capabilities to enrich beer here. Where are they enriching What is going on in this place? Look at all these people, man. They're like, uh Oh, there's like brainwash They're being brainwashed. Notice how they're all happy and smiling 'cause they're drinking enrich How old was that bartender? Was she 16 or 60? You can't tell. You have no Idea. They're timeless. They're endless and timeless. Oh, God. Damn it, dude. We are in big trouble here, man. Oh, shit! Look at that door, dude. See that door right there? The one marked "pirate"? You think a pirate lives in there? I see a door marked "private. " Is that the Is that the door you were talkin' about? No, I was talking a Yeah. I didn't say No, you s What did you hear? I heard you say you saw a door marked "pirate. " And "Is there a pirate living in there?" Yes, that's why you thought No. See, that's Why would there be a pirate living in a Korean restaurant? Are we gonna talk about pirates all day? Or we gonna find out who lives in there? You're the one that All right. Jesus Christ, man. Here we go. What's wrong? Come on, open it. It's locked. All right I'm gonna try this out. What What is that? Your apartment key? Yeah. I'm gonna see if it's gonna work here. That's not gonna work! Why not? We're not at your apartment, shithead! How many possible lock combinations can there be? Oh, so many, dude! Like hundreds of millions. Well, eventually they're gonna overlap. They're not ever gonna over You know what? You're right. It's not working. Oh, no shit. No shit. It was worth a try. It was not worth a try. Well Move over. I'm gonna, like, kick the door or some shit. You're gonna kick it? Really? Damn, dude. This thing is like What? Enriched in its own way. All right.

I'm gonna call Mac and give him the intel. Yeah. Holy shit! All right, see what else you can find out, and call me back. Good work. Forget the microbrew. What's the intel? They're having a karaoke contest. Oh! I'm elevating us to threat level yellow. It's time. Yellow? Yeah. It's time. What were we before? Orange, of course. Orange is much more threatening than yellow! No, that's an old system. It doesn't work anymore. Clearly yellow You go from yellow to orange to red! Yellow is more threatening than orange! Frank, this is orange! Have you seen this? Yellow, orange, red! This is yellow! See this? Red, red! Is this more threatening? Yellow, orange, red! It's backwards going to yellow. Wow. Elevate Color fight. Listen. I need you monkeys outta here 'cause my contestants are waiting. That's a no can do, and I'll tell you why. The Koreans have escalated the conflict. So I've upgraded us to yellow. I don't know what that means. It means we're taking over the talent show. What? No, you're not! It's already done. Go on. I knew it. I told you. You're trying to steamroll me. It's not gonna work. Go on. I'm gonna win this competition. There's nothing you guys can do about it. You're not even gonna be in it, Dee. You have to face facts. You have no talent. You're talentless, sweetie.

Charlie? Mm-hmm? He smell like dog fart. Eww! She says you smell like a dog fart. Oh, yeah? All right, take It off. Take It off for us. Dog fart, huh? Am I in America? Ladies. Nice turnout, huh? Yeah. But I'm getting a little nervous here, Frank. I've heard some rumblings about Mr. Kim's, okay? We gotta keep these people here. Don't worry, Mac. I got a plan. Mac, I got problems, man. I can see that. Why are you wearing the duster with no shirt? I'm trying to get my mojo back. Charlie and I have been competing over the same Korean chick, and he's like totally winning. Why are you wearing my duster with no shirt? This is the perfect combination. Do I really have to explain this to you, bro? Yes! Explain it to me. Are you kidding me? Black leather duster tough, muscular dude underneath it, inside of it. Very sexual. Check this out. Check this out. What's with the hose? Hang on. I'm gonna spray it on the women's tops. We get a better look at their talents if their shirts are wet. Wet T-shirt contest. I like that. Wait, Frank. Frank. How are we gonna have a wet T-shirt contest without girls? We never got any contestants. We can use the girls that are here. They don't even know they're contestants. You can't just blast people with a hose in a bar. They will leave. Lock the door. No, that's not gonna work. Frank, go get your gun. Perfect. Go over to Mr. Kim. Convince him to close for the day. I can do that. Oh, excuse us! Excuse us, please. Excuse us! Heyoh! Heyoh! I love when you say it! We are so happy. And do you know why? We just got engaged. Yes! You guys just got engaged? Yes! Yes. Now we're engaged. All right, do you want to have some champagne? Yes. We're gonna have some champagne to celebrate this. Come on. Champagne! Did you guys happen to catch what Sun-Li was wearing? White tank top. A white tank top. Exactly. I was thinking we could talk Charlie into having her enter the wet T-shirt contest. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll tell him it's all a part of Dee's talent show. Right. When she jumps up on the stage, we'll blast her with the water. The crowd will go crazy. The other girls are gonna want to join in. And we will save the bar. And then she'll break up with Charlie ruining any hopes for happiness that that son of a bitch ever had. I agree with the first part. But the second part seems incredibly harsh. That's the best goddamn part! Look, you guys deal with that. I'm gonna go take care of Mr. Kim. Yeah, what do you want Boom! What the hell is this? Oh, only Mr. Kim's secret microbrew recipe. Hmm. It's in Korean. What am I supposed to do with this? Maybe I can get Sun-Li to translate it for us. Sun-Li? Hi. Could you read this for us, please? Okay. "Bony American is dirty, dirty whore. She bring much shame to herself and country. " Great. Good work, Dee. Yeah. You really topped yourself this year, Sis. Charlie, can we talk to you for a sec? You whore? Mm-hmm. Good. What you want? I'm gonna have to ask you to shut this place down. I am shut down. Look around, you jerk! No one here. Yeah, I was kinda wondering about that. What's up? My daughter, Sun-Li she is missing! Korean broad? You seen her? Uh, no. Oh, she no come home last night! Well, I'm sure she's gonna come back. She probably just met some guy. What you talking about? You sick freak! Sun-Li only 12 years old! What? She just 12-year-old girl! Oh, shit! Attention, everybody. Hey, attention. Our first contestant halls from North Korea. That's right, North Korea, everybody. She's gonna be doing something or other. And then we're gonna blast her with water from a hose. It's gonna be great, right? You're gonna want to stick around for this. And listen, ladies, if you wanna get in on this action, please do not hesitate to do so. Okay, take it away. All set. Uh, wait a second. You're gonna blast my fiancée with water, exposing her breasts to this entire crowd? Yeah, man. Is that cool? That's very cool. Awesome. All right, Sun-Li, hit it! Oh, Great Leader we come to enjoy you You make sun and moon In the sky The earth is spinning because of your laughter All right, she's bombing. Blast her. All righty. All right, everybody! Three, two One! Oh, God! Come on, Frank! What are you doing, Frank? Son of a bitch! The wet T-shirt contest is off! Why? She's only 12 years old! What? You're just 12? Twelve, Charlie! Oh, shit. That actually explains a lot. Wait. Where are you guys going? You guys don't have to leave! No, stay, drink! We didn't know she was 12. Goddamn it! Well, there goes the pub crawl. Oh, son of a bitch. Well, I feel better about myself. Why? Uh, all I did was sleep with a toothless, oily busboy for a recipe. Charlie banged a 12 year old. No, I didn't. What? Yeah. I didn't even kiss that girl. Like, nothing happened. Really? Yeah, absolutely. I can't believe you banged a toothless busboy. Those goddamn North Koreans. They are some sneaky bastards. Yeah. Yep.                     Oh, my God, dude! There is definitely a helicopter pad on the roof of this building. No, there isn't, Charlie. Yes, there is. Every single one of these corporate buildings has a helipad on the roof. Charlie is right. There's always some big boss man fat cat that needs to be able to escape by helicopter. What is he escaping from? Secret tunnels then. Secrets tunnels? There are no Secret tunnels, a monorail system and a helipad. Guys! Can we stop arguing? There are two systems. I don't wanna talk to this corporate drone any longer than we have to. We're split on the helicopters. We'll come back to the secret tunnels. That was an excellent idea. I think we'd better. But we can all agree we should at least hear this guy out. I guess. Yeah, sure. Let's hear the guy out. Okay, we'll hear him out. We're agreed. Sir, please continue. O Okay. Right. Um As I was saying, when I went down to your bar the other day nobody appeared to be working there. There were people there, but they were just customers who seemed to be serving themselves. We're out and about a lot, bro. Get to the point. Well, we here at Media Restaurant Group really think that the location of your bar would be a perfect spot for one of our Oldies Rock Cafés. Shit, dude, how do I explain this to you? I don't know. This bar it's who we are. All right? It's all we've got. It's our life. You wouldn't understand that. You corporate pigs think you can just buy everything. You can't buy everything. We know your kind. You big businesses going all over town swallowing up all the small guys. Well, guess what, pal Paddy's Pub can't be bought. Okay. Well, if you would just please take a look at our offer. Yeah, man. We'll take a look at it, but Sold! There is no way I'm selling the bar. It's time for a life of leisure, buddy. It's time to retire and collect that pension. Think of all the money we're gonna get. What are you talking about? The money from selling the bar. We could retire to an island. We'll all get fat and tan. Dee, you're not gonna get shit. No. We're the shareholders. You own nothing. Are you serious? I have been with you guys since the very beginning. I would think of Paddy's as an Enron-type situation. We're gonna cut and run, and we're gonna leave you out there broke and jobless. It's nothing personal. It's just business. It's a business thing. It does not matter one bit, because I'm not selling the bar anyway. Just take a look. What is that? That's the offer. Let's sell this piece-of-shit bar. Really? Really? Just like that? See ya later, piece of shit! Wait just one second. We have to milk this cow for all she's worth. We need to be wooed. Yeah, I could go for being wooed. Oh. I'd love to be wooed. I could go for some wood. Uh, no. We're saying "wooed. " Yeah. We'll get some wood. We'll build something cool. Then we'll go get the money. That doesn't have anything to do with what we're talking about. We're talking about being wooed by this corporate guy. Dennis, just It's a waste of time? How are you gonna be wood? Let's just Let's just go and sell this bar for everything we can get. Let's do it, boys. Let's go! Wait a second. What the hell am I supposed to do? Don't give a shit. Hi. I need to apply for a job. Right. Just fill out this application and I'll put it in the stack with the others. Dee? Hey. Hi. Are you applying for a job here? Here? Yeah. What, are you crazy? Gross. No, I would never work here. I'm working here. Hmm. Yeah. I'm assistant managing. I thought you worked at the coffee shop. I do still, but a Starbucks moved in across the street and they're stealing all our business. Right across the street? Well, that is good to know. I love Starbucks. Oh. That's why I'm working here. Do you think you can get me a job? Here? I thought you weren't applying. No, that was a lie. Oh. Um Here's my application. Okay. Uh, you didn't fill it out yet. I Know. You do it. I don't mind. I'm gonna grab a beer while you're doing that. Come get me and give me all my stuff, and I'll start. I don't Thank you so much. This is awesome. Did you go to high school or So, you guys ready to sell? Whoa, whoa, whoa, pal. Listen. We have terms. Okay. What are your terms? We'd like a plaque. Of us to be hung in the new restaurant to pay tribute and preserve our legacy. Now, it could also be a statue, okay? Something real classy though. Something like where those American soldiers are raising that flag up in that one war. The war where we saved Japan. Oh, correct. Hiroshima. Actually, Charlie, it wasn't Hiroshima. I'm pretty sure Hiroshima's in Japan. We dropped a nuclear bomb on Japan. Why the hell did we drop a nuclear bomb on Japan? They make all our cars. They're our friends. Not my car. I buy American. American cars are pieces of shit. Everybody knows it. You're making a big mistake. Japan makes the best cars. And Germany. The problem with Germany is they don't make enough hybrids. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me! What? Put some Is that it? Not even close. It's the tip of the iceberg. We also wanna be the ones to blow up the bar. I'm sorry? Don't worry. We've already worked out everyone's part. Mac, he's gonna hold the spool. Charlie's gonna do the countdown. Frank and I, we're gonna push the handle down kablowie. And I want the chopper. No! No! No! No! Excuse me, sir. I would like a helicopter flyby. I don't need to be in it. I just want your corporate chopper to fly by my apartment window real low and fast. Okay. Okay, you know what, here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna pull the deal off the table. Fine. Then we'll go with the original offer. No. Well, something a little less than the original offer. Less money? We would accept something substantially less. I'm gonna go ahead and offer you nothing. You promised that you would not bring up the helicopter. You're not the boss of me, so quit Technically, Charlie, I am the boss of you because I own half your shares. Since when? You sold me half your shares of the bar for goods and services. Wait a second. You've definitely given me half your shares too. Maybe I gave you guys a couple shares when my back was against the wall and I needed a little breathing room. You gave me a shitload of shares for a half a sandwich. What are you guys doing? Is this a hose job where you're hosing me down? You hosed yourself down. You hosed yourself up and down, Charlie. What do you want me to do? I don't care. Get a job. Oh, get a job? Just get a job? Why don't I strap on my job helmet and squeeze down into a job cannon and fire off into job land where jobs grow on jobbies? Now we're wasting time. Will you get outta here? You know what I'm walking. I can't stand you guys. Whew. Now that we got rid of that dead weight, let's come up with a strategy. What's your plan? I'm thinking, if this fat cat is not gonna woo us then we gotta woo him. Yeah, uhhuh I thought you guys were taking me to dinner. Come on. Who doesn't like to watch a naked woman swing 'round on a pole? Gay man, for one. Huh? I'm gay. No. You're so big and tough. You do not come across as gay. You don't look like a gay guy. That's 'cause he's a bear. Huh? He's a bear. Some gay guys are twinks, and others are bears. This gay guy's a bear. By the way, we're totally cool with that. To each his own. Wait. I'm a little confused here. What's a twink? A twink is small and slender like Mac. No. I'm too muscular. I would be a bear. Don't think so. Not hairy enough. Smooth. I would be a bear. See, I don't think you'd be a bear either. I don't know what you would be. You're definitely not a twink. I'd be a top. That's for sure. Maybe. Can a twink be a top, or is that reserved for bears? I'm sure there's a great deal of switching back and forth but I think more often than not bears are tops. Unless they happen to be power bottoms. What's a power bottom? A power bottom is a bottom that is capable of receiving an enormous amount of power. Actually, you got it backwards. A power bottom's generating all the power by doing most of the work. Does the power have to do with the size or the strength of the bottom? Dennis, I've heard that speed has something to do with it. Speed has everything to do with it. The speed of the bottom informs the top how much pressure he's supposed to apply. Speed's the name of the game. Right, buddy? Goddamn it. Now that you have your silverware all set out you're gonna need to refill all the ketchup bottles in your sections. Ooh. That sounds like a whole thing. Know what I'll do if they start to get empty, I'll just grab some from other tables. No, because then someone else is doing your work for you. Yeah, which makes my job easier. That's not how we do it here. You actually have to follow the rules. We're very strict. Which means you probably shouldn't be drinking beer while You probably should get used to it because I'm gonna do it anyway. Dee. Perfect. There you are. Look, I need a Hello. This is a surprising turn. Hello, Charlie. How you doin'? This is good. You working here or Wow. Look at you. You cracked the case. Why are you here then? Kinda hit rock bottom. Need a job. Dee, can you hook me up with a job here? I've been here for, like, two hours. Talk to the manager. Oh, you're the manager now. Good for you. Thanks. Not an easy accomplishment. So, job? I don't think so, Charlie. You're pretty weird, you make me feel uncomfortable, and you smell really bad. You say that, but I don't I don't see it. Look, when I'm at work, I am all about work. Right, Dee? Really does clean a mean toilet. I'll sparkle it. Fine. Okay, fine. I will give you a job. You can be the assistant sanitation apprentice. Oho! Nice. What does that guy do? Hey! That guy is gonna clean up vomit and shit and put out grease fires. Sold. Dee, get me a beer. You can't drink beer on the job. You can get your own beer. I gotta get a beer take the edge off and then I'll get started doin' the fires or whatever you want me to start. What was it? Hey. You need to talk to me? Dee, yeah. One of the bills that you dropped on one of your tables was actually the wrong one. No. I doubledropped it. I used to do it at Paddy's all the time. I use the same bill for two tables, and I pocket the cash for the other one. That's stealing. I know. We're sticking it to those corporate bastards, aren't we? We're not doing anything. Okay. That's rude. If they find out that I know that you're doing this, I'm gonna lose my job. You know what? I'm not asking you to do much. Just turn a blind eye while I rob this place stupid. No. I need this job. Wow. Fine. Fine. Okay. I do. Okay. I have no idea why Dennis thinks you're so cool. Did you say that Dennis thinks I'm cool? What's that? Did you say that Dennis thinks I'm cool? He thinks you're really cool. But he's my brother, so we recap the day with each other. When I tell him about this, I feel like he's gonna be You don't need to tell him that this happened. No? Because if you tell him that I'm cool, then maybe we can forget that this whole thing ever happened. Deal. Deal. Knock, knock. Sorry to interrupt. Dee, let's talk sugars for one quick second. You got a sugar crisis on your tables. Those little sugarholder things they don't refill themselves. We're doing all the work for you, and you're making your manager look bad. Thanks, Charlie. No sweat. It's a team effort out there, right? You gotta pick up your slack. Otherwise, we're doing all the work for you. You're getting a little close. I think I was just stretching out, and maybe you leaned in. I don't think so, but let's not let that happen again. Didn't mean to do anything inappropriate. I was just trying to help out. Okay, you know what? Back to work, everyone. Back to work, everybody. Back to work. Back to work. Will you please drop the act? She is not into you, and you're making me look bad. You're making yourself look bad. Your tables are pathetic, Dee. You're not gonna impress her. We'll see. Yeah. Oh! He's still got it. What is going on here, Frank? Who are these guys? These are the Yellow Jacket boys my old street gang from the '50s. What exactly are your old, pathetic friends doing here, Frank? The corporate guy decided to buy the bookstore down the block. So me and the boys thought we'd do a little loitering. That's dumb. That is a dumb, stupid, dumb idea. Dumb. No, Dennis, it's not that dumb of an idea. If we can establish that there's a seedy element outside of that bookstore maybe the offer comes back to us. Exactly. You guys do whatever you want. I'm gonna go back to that Oldies Rock Café and get Charlie and Dee back. If we're not gonna sell the bar we at least need them here cleaning our toilets and serving us our beer. Great. Frank, please tell me that you have another one of those jackets. Not for you, bitch. What the hell are you doing here? We want you guys to come back because they pulled out of the sale. So you screw me over to sell the bar, and then you blow it. Now you want me to come back just to serve you drinks and not pay me anything. Is that a yes or What is that? That's a no, dick. I am very happy here. I will have you know I am taking this place up the butt with a little scheme I like to call Dee's Double Drop. You're doing the double drop here too? You know about this? Oh, yeah. We always used to take the difference out of your purse. What? Are there always this many chicks here? Yeah. College crowd. Oh, college chicks. I like that. Tell you what. Why don't you get me a job as a bartender here? No. Screw you. I'm not helping you. Why wouldn't you help me? What are you talking about? How is it not obvious? It's not obvious to me at all. You are stupid. You are straight up stupid. Why the hell am I talking to you about this anyway? You're just an underling. Let me talk to a manager. I think that's a very good idea. Why don't you take this application and go to the back office? I'll send the manager right in to you. Okay, all right. Back here? Back there. You son of a bitch. Hey. Sorry for keeping you waiting. It's busy out there tonight. So, Charlie Kelly. Nice to meet you. Uh, I understand you're looking for a bartending position. What the hell you doin'? You're the manager here now? Things move very quickly here at the Oldies Rock Café. May I? I need to look over your forms here. I think I'll just Can I just take a quick peek at that? Thank you. Let's take a little look-see here. Okay. Good. Good, good. This all looks good. So, uh, tell me about Paddy's Pub. Are you kidding me? I think I need to know what your duties were. I'm not gonna answer any of your Did you do anything there? I am not gonna answer any of your questions. Just give me a job. Really. Well, does not respond well to authority. Noted. Goddamn it. Goddamn you. Language is a bit of an issue here at the Oldies Rock Café. Charlie! What are you doing in my office? A little research. Are you Dennis. Hey. Hi. Wow, look at you. You look Lookin' good. Okay. Are you the manager? Yes. First of all, let me just apologize to you for never calling you back, ever. And secondly, I'm here because I'm looking for a bartending job. Oh, well, maybe I should then I'll go and just get your uniform. Get me a uniform? Is that what you were gonna say? We said the same thing earlier. Off you go. Okay. Okay. What is her name again? I hate you. That was a knock, man. This isn't very intimidating, Frank. Don't worry. We're sending out a strong message, Mac. Hey, look, kids. It's a '50s doowop group. What? No, we're not a '50s doowop group. Would you sing us a song? We don't sing, guy. Oh, yeah, we do. We'll sing. We'll sing for you. Right, boys? You guys sing? Of course we sing. We're a gang. No, no! Gangsters don't sing! What are you talking about? Ever hear of gangster rap? We are not gonna intimidate anybody if we're entertaining the whole goddamn neighborhood. Are you kidding me? Listen to this. One, two, three. Bom, bom bom Those darn Yellow Jacket boys Buzz, buzz, bumble They don't pay for soda pop 'cause they really rumble Buzz, buzz, buzz Bzz, bzz, bzz! Goddamn it! Goddamn it! Oohooh Yeah Bumba, babababa, oombaoom Lick 'em and stick 'em, ladies! Whoo! Excuse me. Wow. You know what? You are not allowed to drink on the job. What are you doing? I'm a bartender. All I do is drink. That's against the rules. We're not actually following the rules, are we? Hey, Cocktail, can I get those drinks before my shift ends? I'm sorry. I've been so busy getting so many phone numbers. Yeah, what's that all about? While you've been picking up bar whores I have been doubledropping like a bastard out there. You're doubledropping again? I never stopped doubledropping. That is unbelievable. What are you on about? I thought we were sticking it to the man. I am not sticking it to anyone. This is my job. I have to report you two. Wow. This tattletale business is very ugly, isn't it, Dennis? Yeah. You know what, Dennis. I took a chance giving you a job here, and you're screwing me over. Why are you being so needy? Do you realize how unattractive that is to me? Don't you wanna be attractive to me? Come on. All right, ladies. Who wants to do a shot off my abs? What's goin' on over there? Are you all right? I'm not all right. Dennis and Dee are being complete assfaces. I gave them a chance to work here. They're stealing from the restaurant, and I'm gonna get fired. What? They're stealing? Yes. I will take care of Dennis and Dee for you, all right? I will rid you of those two jerks. Really? Yes. Thanks, Charlie. That's really nice of you. Hey, how about a hug to cheer you up? Well, a quick one. Oh, for real? Oh, man. Okay. That's good. Doesn't this feel right? That felt good. No. Thank you. Wow. Why are you so sweaty? It's really hot in here. It's not hot. It's freezing. It is freezing, isn't it? They're blazing that A.C. All right, listen, Yellow Jackets. Just let me do the talking. I'm gonna let my blade do the talkin'. Jesus Christ, Frank! No blades. Okay? We're just sending him a message. If he doesn't buy the bar, then there's gonna be trouble. You bet. What are you people doing at my house? Well, actually, sir, we are here just to talk. I'm not buying your bar. Look, pal, you'd better not mess with us. You see Hawky over here? Uhhuh. He's crazy. I'm not sure what he's capable of. Is that right? You got something to say, old man? Good night. Guess what. I just topped myself for most phone numbers in one day nine. Nine? Come on. What do you think? Six strawberry margaritas, please. You got it, babe. You know what? Don't make 'em, 'cause you won't have your jobs much longer. Corporate's on their way down here right now to fire your asses. What? You told on us? Babe, don't do that to me. I feel like we were getting so close, sweet baby. He doesn't even know your name. Yes, I do. What's my name? What is it? Beautiful. Oh, my God. You're a dick. I called you Beautiful all the time. Would you not want to be called beautiful? One of you guys the one who called me? Right here. These are the two that were stealing. Wait a minute. I know you. And you. You're the guys who own that dive bar down the street. You're the corporate dude with the helicopter. Right. Here's the thing. I had a really strange night last night. Your friends and their doowop group they showed up at my house and attacked me. One of them died on my doorstep, and it sort of put me in a funk. So I'm gonna clean house, and you're all fired. What? Yeah. You guys are all fired. I'm not fired. I'm not fired, right? Did you hire these people? She sure did. She hired me. Then clearly you're an idiot, because these people are psychopaths. But, no, you're not fired. I'm just kidding. You are. Everybody, get the hell out of my restaurant. Psychotic. Come on. Goddamn it. Goddamn it, Charlie! Really? How am I gonna pay for my rent next month? Don't worry about it. Come live with me. Go to hell! Whoa. She is strung up supertight. You guys wanna do some farewell shots? Absolutely, buddy. Here we go. Hawky lived a fast, hard life. Some stars shine so bright that they burn out before their time. We're gonna miss you, Hawky. Okay. You ready, boys? Yeah. Boom, boom, boom, boom Hawky never spoke much But he had his doo-doo-doowop Now you're buzzing around that hive in the sky Yellow Jacket Hawky Oh, yeah We bid you goodbye Buzz                       Goddamn, I'm bored! Come on. Let's do something. We're a little busy here, Frank. What the hell are you reading? In Touch. In Touch? Why would you read that crap? We are trying to stay "in touch" with what's happening in the world. I'm sorry if we like to keep ourselves informed. You want to be informed? Read a newspaper. Dude! Nobody gets their news from a newspaper anymore. Ah, no, no, no. But, Dennis, look. "Plutonium smuggled into Syria. " That's gonna change my life drastically. That's gonna change everyone's lives! No one can go to Syria anymore for vacation! Don't you guys get tired of doing nothin' except sitting around drinking? What does that mean? Is that a joke? How could you get tired of that? Heyoh! What's up, bitches? What is up? Turn the TV on right now, dude! This is huge! Turn the TV on! I'm gonna be on the news! Oh, my God. There was an accident today. Then the news talker asked Mac what happened. And he totally went off! I went off for 20 minutes. It was amazing. I totally popped. Here it is! Oh, you popped. You're gonna be famous. Shut up! Shut up! This is Ken Jacobs coming to you from Market Street where two buses collided just minutes ago. We talked to one local resident who had this to say. It was absolutely crazy. Police are currently investigating the cause of the accident. Back to you, Jim. What the hell was that? Yeah, you really popped. I think you're gonna be a star. You're gonna be a big star. Be in a magazine. No, no, no. I talked for, like, 20 minutes about how the traffic system sucks. And the lights And that we should only have yellow lights because then we can be very cautious but not get stuck in traffic. It was great. That sounds incredibly dangerous and stupid. The point is that that newscaster that bastard newscaster just went in there and cut it all up Cut you all up, dude! Just to make his corporate bosses happy, which is bullshit. Nobody's getting the real news anymore! That's not real news. Remember when we made the news show for eighth grade? For social studies? Now, see, that was real news. We didn't distort facts! We told it like it was. Yes! Yeah, I remember that video. You guys were burning G.I. Joes and throwing rocks at cats. That was what was happening! That's what was going on in the world, man! That was the truth. We'd been throwing rocks at cats for years, Dennis. We had been! And that's what we were reporting on. What was happening in the world! We can make better news. We could, Charlie. You want me to grab my camera? Yes. Just like the old days. Let's go out there. Let's make some news. I want in on this action because I am bored to death sitting here. No, that's a bad idea. Usually when you get involved, somebody gets hurt. That's ridiculous. I'm just palling around with the guys. How's anybody gonna get hurt? How much more tape? I just don't want it to jiggle around. I don't want to put any more tape on it. I'm the one who's carrying it. What are you guys doing? I've put a light on the front of the camera. What this does is it makes the news talker look brighter. It always looked fine when we did it. Frank's got a good idea here. We're gonna put this stuff on public access TV. Anybody can get on that! Yeah. What? Nobody watches that shit! Dude, there's all sorts of great stuff on public access. Oh, is there? Well, let's see what kind of quality programming we have here. What is this? This is public access. God, that Is so strange. Ew. Should I turn It off? No! Well, don't jump to We'll just keep it on for a little bit. Let's watch it for a little while. Let's find out what Do It. Get after it, huh? Yeah, yeah. All right, let's turn It off! Turn It off! Shut It off! Okay. We're gonna go down to the power plant and talk about how it's giving the whole city cancer. Holy shit, dude! I didn't know that! He's making it up, Charlie. Why would you do that? That's a great story! It scares the shit out of everybody. Yeah. Everybody will be terrified. We don't want to just scare people. We want to blow the lid off of real scandals. Expose real crime and corruption. What? People don't care about that shit. They want glitz and glamour, celebrities. They want to read about shit that's gonna help them forget how miserable their lives are. And pretend like they know what it's like to be famous 'cause that's what everybody wants. Of course everybody wants to be famous 'cause celebrities get everything. Easiest job in the world. You don't even have to do anything anymore to be famous. No. Look at Paris Hilton. She's just a dirty, drunken whore. You could be famous for being a dirty, drunk whore. You're a dirty, drunk whore already. I'm not. But I could be famous if I just got drunk, went out to a club let people shoot some video with their fancy camera phones. Right. Get a couple of up skirts, a couple nip slips. Boom. You'd be famous like that. I think I'd like to avoid the nip slips and up skirts. I see where you're going with this. I'll talk you into it at some point. And I could be famous just by being friends with you. Absolutely. Great. Good luck with that. Frank, Charlie and I are gonna go to where the real action is. Boom! Why'd you drag us to a place like this? It smells like the bottom of a birdcage. Lots of shady shit goes down in nursing homes, Frank, okay? These places are like prisons. Like people getting assraped? What? Oh, my God, dude. No, not like people getting assraped. People don't want to be here because they feel like They're getting assraped. Nobody's getting assraped, Frank! God, man. Stop saying "assraped. " We're locked and loaded here, man. I'm ready to shoot this thing. Let's talk to this woman. Yeah, let's go. Come on. Let's move. Okay, here we go. I'm gonna do, like, a catchphrase thing. Ready? In, three, two, one. Here we go. Good afternoon, Philadelphia. This is Mac coming to you live from the Malvin Retirement Home. Go, go, go, go. Hello, miss. What's your name? Irvene Simon. Hello, Irvene. Why don't you tell us what's really going on here? Cool face. Hold It. Hold It. Well, I get up around 5:00. Then I eat breakfast. I like to have fruit. She steals the grapes! I do not! Check her purse! I think we've covered breakfast. Let's move past it. Good save. Then after breakfast I like to sit and read recipes. I don't even know how to cook. Is there anything that you want to tell the world, Irvene? My grandson's birthday's on Friday. No, no. Is there anything about this place that you don't like? The blacks. Cut! Cut! Cut that! What are you cutting for? That was just starting to get good. It was not good, okay? It was the ramblings of a crazy, old racist. Is it hot in here? I meant to bring this up. How are you sweating so much? It's freezing! It's freezing! Yeah. They try to keep them alive. Because meat spoils slower in a fridge. So they keep it cold. That interview was terrible. It was terrible. We need a more exciting truth. We do. Yeah. Let's set this place on fire. Let's burn it to the ground! Now you're talking. We're not setting a nursing home on fire! Those curtains would go up like a snap. No, we need to find a more exciting part of the city. Wait a second. I know just the place. The shit's always going down in Chinatown, boys! Okay, okay. Quick conference, guys. Everyone keep their eyes peeled for drifting. All right? People here, they love to Look. Look at this guy. He's definitely a drifter. He's going to his car and he's gonna slide it sideways. Oh, my God. And you know what happens with Tokyo drifting? It leads to bickering. They always bicker. Which, of course, leads to karate. Which eventually will lead to dudes flying from window to window and treetop to treetop. Shooting lightning bolts out of their fingers. Yeah! There's the guy that shoots the lightning bolts out of his hands! He wears the big, straw hat. And he does that. We're on the same page. His eyes go all white and shit. Let's do It. And Kurt Russell fights him. Oh, my God, dude. The smell is overwhelming. What the hell are these guys doing? They're just trading fish for other fish is what it looks like. They're not even bickering. This isn't gonna lead to karate. I think what we gotta do is find one sick guy and do a story about a new pandemic. No one cares about those kinda things, Frank. This guy looks sick. That's the same fish they just passed to each other. Like bird flu, fish flu. We gotta get 'em to fight. They just passed that same fish head back and forth. You think we could get 'em to fight? Whoa. Here we go. What's that, huh? Oh, that looks exciting. Ooh. Let's go. That's a bunch of people. Let's go. Come on. Charlie, fire up that camera. I'm doing it. Can you see sweat? Because I'm sweating a little bit. So much. Yeah? It's a lot? Okay. What if I do That's better. Go. Okay. Good afternoon, Philadelphia. We're here in Chinatown where a large crowd has gathered for what can only be a martial arts showdown. You look scared. I'm not. I'm sorry. I'm just sweating. It's very hot. Martial arts. Okay. Martial arts expo Just go in. Go in. Goddamn it! Love 30. Whoa. A pandemic. Bird flu! Bird flu! I think he's choking, guys. What? He is choking! Frank, give him the Heimlich! I'm not gonna touch him. I don't know what he's got. Do you know the Heimlich? I don't know the Heimlich! Punch him in the stomach or something. Okay. Oh, baby! I did it? You okay? I did it! I saved your life! I saved your life, bitch! Whoo! Yeah! That is exactly the kind of stuff we should be filming. I'm a hero! You got that, right, Charlie? Yeah. Yeah. I did and I didn't, Frank. What? I did and I didn't. You were pointing the camera at him, right? You got it, right? The punch and everything, right? No, I did I did point the camera at it. But you know what? I did not put a tape in here. What? What are you talking about? The problem was that I got the flashlight on. And I taped the whole deal up. I realized I'd have to cut all the tape off to get the tape in. I didn't have much more duct tape. So I figured, stick with the flashlight while we got it. So you never put a tape in? While we were out there taping the guys with the fish! Oh, my God! See what's happening here? We're getting a yelling Yeah, we're gonna get yelling! Oh, I'm sorry! I forgot to put a tape in! I forgot to put a tape in! All right, all right, all right! All right. Here's what we do. We recreate your heroic moment. That's it. We do it again. We just recreate it? Yes! This time we put a tape in Tape in this time, yes. Take the light off of it maybe. Yeah, maybe we don't sweat so much. Maybe we'll wear more makeup. Don't blame it on my sweat glands. That's not fair. We'll just recreate the whole thing. All right, let's And you know, you can And this time I could I could look a little bit more heroic. You could look a lot more heroic, bro. We'll put enough makeup on you. You'll look like the shit. All right. Let's just make some news, please. All right. Ooh! I feel like we've been standing in this line forever! For like our lifetimes! I don't know if we're ever gonna get inside of this place. Dee, it's a club. You have to wait in a line. I gotta be honest with you. I feel like I'm just a little bit too drunk to stand up. You were supposed to wait and get drunk inside the club, not outside the club. Nobody gives a shit about a stupid, drunk whore outside of a club. That's a lot of talking you're doing. I gotta lay down. Lie down? What are you talking about? What are you doing? Dee? Oh! Now you're just some stupid, drunk chick lying in garbage. Night-night. "Night-night"? Night-night. Great. You want to come in with us? Uh, yeah. Here, take this. What is this? You'll see. Oh! Oh, my God! Holy shit, it's bright out here! Dee, get up. Get up! Come on! What? Where am I? I'm crashing pretty hard. I need to go home and get some sleep. What happened last night? Don't make me into the bad guy. I'm going out of my way to make us both famous. It's not my fault if you're not living up to your end. Okay. Well, why don't you take my picture now? Dee, that's not gonna work, okay? You're not famous yet. You're just some stupid, drunk chick who slept in her own puke. Really? We'll come back tonight. Come on. Ride's leaving. Can No, come on. I'm not gonna stand in this big line again. We don't have to wait in line. Famous, drunk whores, they don't wait in line. They shove their way to the front and they take a shit all over the bouncer. That's what you're gonna do. Don't know if I feel comfortable taking a shit on that bouncer. You just gotta talk down to him a little bit. Make him feel like he's beneath you. That way, he'd be too afraid not to let you in. Right? Really? The guy doesn't want to lose his job. I don't know. Dee, do you want to be famous or not? All right? Take a shit on this guy. Okay. Shove your way. Go. Shove, shove. I can shit on him, I think. Hey, look out. Jesus, you're in my way! Move it! Move it! Hey! Okay. Good start. Short stuff, out of my way. Yeah, you saw me. Hi, there. What's your name? Dee Reynolds. You on the list? List? I don't need to be on that list, you idiot. You piece of dirt. Who are you? I step on you. I clean you off of my shoes at night. I step on you, and then I throw away the shoe. That shoe that I just threw away, that's worth more than your worthless life, mister. And I am pissed because I loved that shoe. You dirt. You piece of subhuman shit. Whoa, whoa. Dee, take it easy, all right? I'm not gonna take it easy because this talking dump of a bouncer is starting to get on my nerves. I'm gonna have you fired, dick hole. Do you know who I am? Do you have any idea? Or is your brain too tiny to have ideas? Is there any kind of thought roaming around in that thick, shit skull of yours? You with her? No! Nope. What? And what is your name? Dennis Reynolds. Dennis Reynolds? Well, what do you know, Dennis Reynolds? You're on the list. No, no Oh, wow. That's awesome. What? But you're not gonna go in without me, right? Uh Dancing Guy! Oh, I love your show, man. Wow, Dancing Guy! Stop pressing so hard. Dude, I have to press hard. You get so nervous, you sweat through it every time. Just make sure that it's even. I'm gonna make it even, man! You need to just start calming down and relaxing a little bit more, man. I'm very stressed out, Charlie. It's a very stressful situation. Then relax, dude. Calm yourself a little bit. Hey, hey, hey. I'm sorry. I just No, come on, dude. Shh. That's not such a Well, it's Okay? Come on, dude. Hey, who's that sexy news guy It's Mac Yes, it's Mac It's Mac. And he's on the channel whatever we make it on news Right? We're gonna make it on the TV All right, here it is. You go into the building. You go into the building. You run out. And get the kitties. With the little box of cats, right? A box of cats. And you save them. You save them! I save them from what? Uh Are you gonna set the building on fire? No! Charlie, are you gonna set the building on fire? Yes. Goddamn it! You want the show to be a hit or what? I am not running into a burning building! It's gotta be exciting! That's what the news talkers Come on, dude. Well, I quit. 'Cause I can't seem to get into any of the clubs. And if I can't get into any of the clubs, then how the hell am I supposed to get famous? Three, two, action. Good evening, Philadelphia. We've just received word that a litter of adorable kittens is stranded somewhere inside this building that could erupt into flames at any moment! Who will save them? Good, good. Now shoot the building now. What? Okay. Who will save them? Move, dude! I know, but I'm saying If I could get into the Go. Calm down, calm down, calm down, dude! So I just go grab the box of kittens and run out? Yeah. That's all there is to it. You'll be famous. Everybody loves a hero. Okay. Sounds easy enough. Get to it. It smells overwhelmingly like kerosene in here! Uhhuh. I cannot believe you guys. I could've been killed! Somebody had to save those kittens. They were trapped inside a burning building, Deandra. You set me on fire! We set the building on fire. You just happened to catch on fire. Barely. Yeah, we put you out. That's right. I'm on fire! I'm on fire! Well, I do look really heroic. No, you do not look heroic! You threw the box of kittens. How do you figure? I was on fire! We gotta shoot this shit again. Yeah, like fire hurts. All right. Hey, Dancing Guy! That's the man. Now this is entertainment. Oh. I can't believe It doesn't make any sense, man. It's, like, what is he What's the time? Diaper Time! Whoa! What? That is weird. They're really stepping up the insanity here. Where do they find these people? Look at these people. Do you not find this sad and embarrassing for them? Those people are pieces of shit. But I want to watch it. So much and so often I want to watch it. I think we should throw parties and just sort of watch it together. Because this is television at its best. Definitely. People love well stories. Really? Yes! I feel like well stories are played out. Who gets stuck in a well anymore? Kittens do. Kittens? You guys put those kitties in there? What else were we supposed to put down there, Dee? Oh, man! All right, fine. I'll do it. But don't set it on fire, okay? I feel like this is dangerous enough. Deandra, use your head. How are we gonna set a well on fire? It's filled with water. Huh? Get in the well! I'm going! Save the kittens! Save the day! Give me the matches. Yep. I found the kittens! Oh, come on! Okay, it's all good through here. Hey! There you go. She throws the kittens in every take. Oh, she loves to ruin and ruin and ruin and ruin. Do you guys mind keeping it down a little bit? It's 5:00 in the afternoon. What the hell? I was at the club all night. What? Are you turning into a club kid now? Oh, man. You guys should've been there, man. Everybody was there. It was so awesome. We've been trying to turn Dee into a hero by, like, getting her to rescue kittens in compromising situations. But she messes up every time! Hey, what if we set up, like, a conveyor belt situation, right? Put the cats on that. And then at the end of it, a chopping mechanism. Oh, yeah! Let's chop cats! Hey! This is good! No. Let's chop cats! We don't actually chop the cats. Dee grabs them before they get chopped. We'll chop a couple cats so that you know it's real. No. I don't think anybody's really gonna give a shit about a nobody saving a bunch of kittens. But a celebrity saving cats Then you got a story. So what are you suggesting? I'm building up quite a reputation around town. Especially in the club scene. With my connections I could probably finally get Dee into some of those clubs. Once she's in those clubs, I can turn her into a celebrity. And once she's a celebrity, you guys got a story. You think she's gonna go for that? She's pissed at you, bro, for ditching her there. I don't think Dee's that desperate to get famous. I mean, nobody's that pathetic. I can't believe how famous I'm about to be! Run off to the bathroom and cram a couple fingers down your throat. Bulimia's really big with this crowd. I just tried, but I've been throwing up all day long. I don't think I have any food left inside of me. Well, try harder. Because it's really important, all right? Yeah. Okay. If only just for show. Dennis! Hey! Hey! These are the girls. Don't screw this up. These girls can make or break you in this town. Hey. You look gorgeous. Hey, listen, ladies. This is my sister. Notice how disgustingly skinny she is. Isn't it weird? Oh, my God! You are like crack skinny! Oh! Okay! That's a compliment. She throws up all the time. Oh, my God. I just got done. I'm sorry if my breath stinks. Hey, Dennis, want one? Maybe not tonight, ladies. I'm kinda working on something. Oh, come on. Don't be a loser. Yeah! Well, uh, all right. Yeah, maybe just one. Do you have one for my sister too? Sure. What is it? You'll see. Chop, chop, chop. Good! Good! The cat's dead. I don't see any problems with that other than the fact that the camera might see my hand killing the cat. We're gonna pull the cat out of there before it gets to the chopper. But if Sweet Dee doesn't make it in time, you're gonna see me chop the cat. Just don't drop the cat. I can't make that promise. Come on. Whoa! Where have you guys been? You look like shit. I don't want to talk about that. Did you become celebrities yet? We're not doing the celebrity thing anymore. We're done with that. No. We need you guys. 'Cause we got this great chopping mechanism. It's for the news show. There is no news show, Charlie! Yes, there is a news show, Dennis! We're gonna put it on public access! Nobody watches public access. I don't want to be on public access. What? Hey! Hey, Dancing Guy's on! No, no, no, no! Turn that off! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Dancing Guy's a great show. Charlie. No, Charlie. Turn it off, man. Turn it off! What's the time? Diaper Time! What's the time? Diaper Time! Congratulations, guys. You're famous.                     Dee's bringing another boyfriend? She won't shut up about this one. He's a local rapper. He's like some hotshot rapper. What's his name? Lil' Jeff. Lil' Joe. It's was, like, Jonathan, Little Michael. Lil' Kev? Little Lil' Kev. Shit. I've heard about him. He's a local celebrity. He's supposed to be the next Eminem. What is he? Like a small guy or little guy? No, probably not. I think it's just a rapper thing. Lil' Kim. Yeah, it's like You never know though. He could have, like, a little hand or a little foot or something. I doubt he'd want to call attention to that by calling himself Lil' Kev. That could be his thing. Biggie Smalls was fat. Yeah. He was big and small. You know, and, like Right. I guess his head was small, but his body was big. So this guy could have, like, a little hand and a giant body. What's up, hos? I'd like you to meet somebody. Kevin, these are the clowns I work with. Oh, this your crew, baby? Mm-hmm. Girl, you silly. They ain't no clowns. What up, fellas? What's up, man? Hey, man. How's it going? I gots to get back to the studio, but I'll holler at you later, okay, pooh bear? Mm-hmm. Yo, later, fellas. See ya, man. Yeah. Boom. Yep, you're seein' it. Hey, Dee, does that guy have, like, a like, a little hand? Charlie, I was gonna say his foot looks small. Nah. Well, dude, it's possible. The shoes were the same size, but his hand was like He doesn't have a little hand or a little foot. Wait. Did that guy go to Waldron? I don't know. Is his name Kevin Gallagher? Yes. Holy shit. No, that guy's retarded. Well, you're retarded. No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying he is an actual retarded person. We went to elementary school together. He used to take classes in a trailer outside school. He rode the short bus. Whatever. You think I wouldn't know if the guy I'm dating is retarded? There is no way I am dating a retarded person. But he's so tough and popular and famous. I mean, he's a successful musician. Jesus, sweetie. The guy might be retarded. Yeah, but he might not be. Plus, he gives me things. Did you guys see this necklace? It's got diamonds in it. L I gotta think about this. Come take a look at my elementary school yearbook sometime, Dee. He's retarded. Uh, guys, I'm getting an idea. Charlie, follow me on this one for a second. Okay. Retarded or not I mean, clearly there's something off about that guy. Oh, no. That guy's very messed up. Yeah. No, he's I'm saying he's retarded. Yeah, whatever. But he's an up-and-coming musician. I mean, he's, like really building a following in this city. He's like the next Eminem. Right. He's supposed to be big. Okay. So, if he can do it, why can't we? I can't argue that logic, man. What are you suggesting? I'm thinking we start a band. Holy shit. Yeah! Yeah? We're in a band! Yeah! Let's do it! I've always wanted to be a rock god. If he's getting chicks Ooh! Ooh, ooh. Why are you "ooh, oohing" me? Why are you You're not in it. Why am I not in it? I have a great voice. You do have a great voice. You have an excellent voice. But the problem is you're into all that early '80s glam rock fem shit and it's just not the artistic direction I want to take the band in. Artistic direction? You guys don't even play instruments. Well, no Okay, well, that doesn't matter, does it? Because it's all about rocking and looking cool and kicking ass. Yeah, I think he's right. It's all about image and marketing. I mean, there's no bands out there with any musical ability. Frank, I like the way you think. You're in the band. Oh! Wow. Dude, don't overreact about it, man. See you, buddy. Frank, get out that checkbook. You're gonna buy us some instruments. Yeah, brother. That's a hot guitar. You got, uh, graphite reinforced neck, 35 inch scale, two humbuckers. Yeah, guy, move over six inches. Oh, yeah. Um, yeah, so I was saying Yeah, that's it. Shut up. Soak it in. Uh, so I was saying, uh, graphite reinforced neck Boom. Yeah. Shh. That's the one. Check this thing out, man. It's like a weapon. Cool, bro. Holy shit. Where did you learn how to play like that? Oh, man, keyboards just make sense to me, man. I get 'em, you know? Charlie, you're amazing. Hey, man, you're gonna be our ace in the hole. You know what though? Can I talk to you for a second about this? Sure. Any way that I can be in the back of the stage or, like, behind some kind of curtain? Why? Well, can I bare my soul to you for a second, man? Of course, buddy. This is huge for me. I've always wanted to do this. Mm-hmm. It's, like, this is a big deal. I've just always been afraid that people are gonna boo me or they're gonna hate me. It's why I've never pursued my dreams, man. So, I mean, if that happens it's gonna crush me, I'm gonna crumble, I'm gonna fall to pieces, I'm gonna scream. You're not listening to what I'm saying, are you? Totally. Dude, I think we should do, like, a Sex Pistols thing, right? Where I'm Sid Vicious and you're Johnny Rotten. No, no. I'm Simon and you're Garfunkel, if anything. No. You're Axl. I'm Slash. No. I'm Holland Oates. You're, like, Peter Gabriel. Hall and Oates is two separate people. No. Holland is his first name and Oates is his last name, dude. Whatever, dude. I just wanna kick ass. Hey. You with that bald guy? Yeah. Yeah, well, get him out of here, or I'm calling the cops. I'm taking these. There he is. Good old Special K. He is drooling on himself. Well, so what? He's, like, seven in this yearbook. Okay, if I'm gonna break up with this guy, I need some proof. Well, look, Dee, you're free to date whoever you want, okay? I just think you should know whether or not you're gold-digging a retarded guy. Okay, number one, I'm not gold-digging anybody, okay? I really like this guy. And second of all, this doesn't prove that he's retarded. You want proof? I want proof. When are you seeing him next? I'm picking him up in, like, an hour. You're picking him up? He doesn't drive. Ooh. Uh, that's funny 'cause people who aren't retarded usually drive. Retarded one. Normal zero. Not bad, Dennis. Nice neighborhood. Owns his own house. Three stories. Looks like it's retarded one, normal one. Yes? Oh, hi. I think we have the wrong address. Are you Dee? Yeah. Who are you? I'm Kevin's mom. Come on in. Oh, lives with his mom. I think I'll be taking that point back. Kevin's in his room. Go on up if you like. Oh, thank you, Mrs. Gallagher. You must be very, very proud of your son. I mean, he has overcome some pretty difficult odds. Yes, he has. Well, you're talking about the rapping. Excuse me? Those odds you're referring to, you're talking about his rapping career. I guess. Mrs. Gallagher would you describe your son as a "special" guy? No, you can't do that. Why can't I do that? What's wrong Because he's her son. Of course he's special. That's an easy yes. You think he's special, right? Well, yes. Yeah, that means nothing to me. That means a whole lot. Retarded three, normal zero. Hold on. Hang on. How come you got that point? That was my point. What That was my point. Retarded two, normal one. She practically came out and told us he was retarded. Retarded four, normal zero. Whoa! Hold on a second. Where'd four come from? It's definitely not four. Let's see. There's the driving, the drooling in the yearbook the overcoming the odds, the living with the mom and now the special thing. You know what? It's not four. It's five. Yeah? Are you the point king? You pick up points left and right? It's retarded three, normal one. Oh, come on. There's so much more retarded stuff that What's up? Hey! Oh, you brought your crew, baby. This is my brother, Dennis, and he's gonna give us a ride. Oh, snap! What up, son? Hey. I didn't know we were doing all that. Yo, I gotta grab a couple of things. Be ready to "rizzoll." Man, that's retard strength if I've ever seen it. You know what I mean? Shut your mouth. Go! Go! Go! All right, stop! Stop! Why are you not singing? Well, uh, it doesn't sound very good. Well, then huff some glue, bro. Oh, I've been huffing glue, guys. Then growl into the microphone, Charlie. No. This is I don't even wanna growl. I'm not a growler. Wait. Band meeting! Band meeting! Yeah, band meeting! We need to have a band meeting! Hold on a minute! We're sittin' around here practicin' like a bunch of pansies! We should be out gettin' wasted and breakin' shit! Frank's absolutely right. How can we be rock stars if we're not living like rock stars? Well, okay. If we live like rock stars, the music will come! Okay. Okay. Okay. The music will come, Charlie! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Stop, dude! What are you doing? That's my good chair. That's your good chair? Yeah. It's covered in bird shit. No. That's toothpaste, man. That's clearly bird shit. No, it's not. It's toothpaste. Do you even own a toothbrush? I, uh Look, don't break my chair. Oh, my God! No! Wait, wait, wait. Wait a minute. Charlie is right. We should not be breaking our own shit. We should be out there breaking other people's shit. That's rock and roll. Yeah! That's what I'm talking about! You feeling better, Charlie? Whoo! Yeah! Whoo! Keep smashing things, guys! It's a ripple effect! Hey, how'd you guys get a hotel room without putting a credit card down? We did use a credit card, man. I took it out of your wallet. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. My credit card number's down at the desk? Yeah. You mean we're smashing up a hotel room with my credit card down at the desk! Why-Why-Why would you do that? Uh, they don't let you book a hotel room without putting down a credit card, Frank. What year do you think it is? Well, we gotta put this stuff back together again. What? Get the glue. Charlie, you gotta get the glue. What? Glue is for huffing, dude. Get me the glue! Get me the glue! It's a part of his process. This is not rock and roll! Oh, this shit is funny! You like this movie? Your shirt's on backwards. What? Oh, snap! It is. Oh, look! We need to break up. Yes, sir. Yes, sir! Hey. Where's your suit? I'm not wearing the suit, Frank, because it's lame, and you look like a pussy. That-That defeats the whole purpose. I mean, the idea is to trick the moms into letting the kids bop with us. It's not the '50s anymore, Frank. The kids aren't bopping anymore. They're banging each other and doing meth before they hit grade school. Well, can I at least pick the name of the band? What do you got? The Pecan Sandies. Isn't that a cookie? Yeah, it's a cookie, but it's got another meaning. What's the other meaning? What? Other than a cookie, what's the other meaning? It's a, you know It's a It's a sexual meaning. No, we are not the Pecan Sandies, all right? We are Chemical Toilet.

He tried to convince me that you were retarded. Uh, what? Yo, what? That's bananas, girl. I know. You're not retarded, are you? All right, Paddy's! You ready to rock? Yeah! No? Yeah! What up, Paddy's? Make some noise! Get off. Get off the stage, idiot. Come on, idiot. Come on. Let's go. Come on. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Bust a little freestyle for you. This one's for my girl, Dee. This one's for you, baby. Word! Yo! Let me tell y'all a story 'bout a girl I knew A brokeass bitch with a gayass crew She said that I was cute She said that I was funny But the honey couldn't stop lookin' at my money Busted old lady with a flat tiny ass Her body like a skeleton in science class Face beat up by the school of hard knocks Hair so fried and bleached by Clorox It's like she's skinny but fat in all the wrong places Mothers gotta cover their babies' faces When she walks by people think she's Godzilla Straight out of Compton No, y'all, straight outta "Thriller" Looking like a zombie Walking like a chicken Mouth full of shit That's why her breath be stinkin' Just one question, Dee before you take your bow This gravy train's leavin' so who's retarded now Hey. Ladies. Later, bitch. I don't think he's retarded. Mmmmm. Hmm.                     Would you describe these pieces more savory or succulent. It's definitely way too over cooked to be succulent, but it's still pretty delicious. It's still savory, right? Now, what if we insert it in beer? Do you think that would help like regain it's succulence.
 Like a beer-rub.
 hu-hum. That's actually really smart. Mac, grab us some beers. Bite my bird. What are you eating? Oh, dude, Dee and I cooked up a great steak. Frank's got, like, this whole fridge full of these delicious meats that I've been stealing. You guys wanna try some of this? Someone who sweats as much as you should not work with food. Charlie? You son of a bitch! I told you stay away from my meat!
 Spit it out.
 Come on. Spit it! Spit it out! Now! You too. Spit! Come on. Right there. Why you're being such a selfish jerk? Hey! I killed the dear, I should get to eat it. That's the natural order. Wait, you shot a dear? That's right. 10 point buck Ping! Right between the sorrowful little eyes. Since when do you, bro? Since always. I'm a great hunter. How does hunting a defenseless creature make you a good hunter? Yeah, you should go after something that could at least defend itself. You know, a really great hunter would go after something that can hunt him back.
 Like a man!
 Hell yeah, dude, a man? Don't even joke about hunting a man. Who's joking? I'm not joking. I think that hunting a man would be the only true test of a good hunter. Yeah? I was hunted once. I just came back from Nam. I was hitching through Oregon and some cop started harassing me. Next thing you know, I had a whole army of cops chasing me through the woods. I had to take 'em all out. It was a bloodbath. That's Rambo, dude. What? You just described the plot of Rambo. Yeah, that's the first from the first one. Yeah, I think you gave us the life of the Rambo. That's not the first time you've described your life in the way of John Rambo's like. Yeah, you know what? It's actually making me think I can get on board with man-hunt. Really?
 Me, too, dude.
 I'm just throw that out there. No. You do not go on a man-hunt.
 Screw ya.
 Yeah. It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia 1st Aired: 9/18/2008 (FX) Try that one.
 This one?
 hu-hum.
 Good, a little bit of sauce with.
 We don't have any slice left.
 It was just the The Natural Juice of two by the way.
 Oh, so good! It's not actual sauce. Oh, my god, good job! I can't believe that dick horrible put the lock on the refrigerator.
 What a sonofabitch.
 That wasn't cool. You know what though? At least he forgot about this piece. What a dump ass. Did you do something different thought? 'cause it's sooo good this time.
 I barely cooked it.
 Really? I'm talking like not at all.
 No kiddin'.
 hu hum. What I did, I slopped through the radiator for minute.
 That's pretty bogus.
 not warmed it. No, but it's cleaned up. It's so good though. I don't care. Okay, good. But here's a good side. Well, well, well~ What have we here. Looks like you two're up and enjoying my meat! Yes, we have a new fashious meat hug. Yeah, hey, Franky. Sharing it. It's a rule now~ Well, I'm glad you enjoyed yourselves. Maybe we should open up a bottle of desert wine. A nice port, that would compliment what you have just eaten. By the way, you know what you've just eaten, right? Was it venison? You wish it was venison. Was it a horse? Horse? That, which you have just eaten, that, which your teeth have just torn apart. Your taste buds have savored, that was human meat.
 Yeah, ok.
 So stupid.
 You're so stupid!
 Well, thank you for the human meat, Frank. Thank you for our human meat.
 No, you're welcome.
 It was delicious.
 I knew you're gonna steal from me again.
 You're stupid.
 That's why I put a lock on the fridge.
 Yeah.
 And only left one piece of meat out.
 I get it.
 Human meat
 Alright. Where'd you get the human meat from, Frank?
 I got a guy.
 You got a guy? Oh, you got a human meat guy?
 I got a guide for everything, Charlie.
 You're so full of shit.
 Yeah, ok, right.
 Oh, yeah, Deandra, you think I'm full of shit?
 hu hum
 Well, you enjoy yourselves, now.
 Thank you.
 I am glad you had a good time eating human meat.
 Thank you.
 That wasn't human meat though, right?
 No~~~! Hey yo. Dennis, I did it. It took me all day, but I finally finished a list of ten people that would be perfect to hunt. Great, and I totally respect your opinion, but I've already made a decision. That's the complete opposite of respecting my opinion. Hey, don't I know it. Check it out, bro. Hey! Dennis, are you sure Dee is coming? Yeah, yeah, she's coming. She wants to look great for your big date.
 Do I get that right? Are you serious?
 Yeah, man, he's perfect. You don't believe? Check it out. Hey, Cricket, will you, come out here for few second please. Yeah. just stand before us here. Now, check out his legs. See how they're almost tierd? They're like pretty much back to perfect. Yeah. And check out his cane. Looks like he's whittled it into some sort of defensive tool. Wow. But, that makes you quite formidable, huh? Ok, what's going on here, huh?
 Where is Dee?
 Admit it, Mac.
 He's perfect.
 Yeah. Yeah, he'll do just fine. Oh, god, oh, god. I know you're up to something. You're gonna harvest my organs, aren't you?
 Yeah,
 Hey, relax.
 You're gonna rope me and you're gonna harvest my organs.
 Relax, Cricket, relax, relax, take it easy. You don't wanna be all nervous and sweaty when Dee gets here. It's ture she's coming? Ok, ok. Yeah, for second there, I thought you guys're gonna do something terrible to me. Yeah, we are. Stack on 'em. No, we're gonna hunt you. What? We are going to hunt you, Cricket. Why? Uh.. I'll spend a lot less time asking questions, more time running. Yeah. What, what happens if.. if I get caught?
 Wu, don't get caught.
 Don't get caught. There he goes and hunt begins! Indeed, indeed.
This gonna be fun.
 Yeah. What do you suppose gonna happen when we do catch him?
 Well, I suppose we do some tea-bag related.
 hum Dee! You're home, thank god. Ok, let's talk. Let's have a quick conversation, huh? What do you think?
 I couldn't sleep last night, could you?
 Nope. And I'll tell you why.
 Yesterday.
 Yesterday. What's going on? Oh my god, Charlie. I didn't wanna say anything, but I'm thinking there's some strange going on with this meat, such a wish. Yes, ok, now, I know it's crazy. The idea Frank feeding us human meat.
 Yes!
 But, I'm trying to disapprove it.
 I absolutely can.
 You can't do it, can you? Let's talk to taste.
 The taste!
 the taste, Charlie, I tried everything.
 I can't get the taste out of my mouth!
 You can't get it out, right?
 Absolutely not.
 And if you try all source of other meats,
 Yes!
 like daily meats and sandwich meats.
 Absolutely! And then did you go crazy? Just looking everything in your apartment, like your shoe, item with a catch fanny, like nothing's working, right? Maybe, it's a trick. Ok? Maybe, he went and got some weird, exotic meat that we wouldn't thank to try.
 Ok, it's not like regular grocery store kind of meat.
 No, not meat from a grocery store. He got it from some weird place. Ok, let's, let's think here. Let's put our heads together. Where could Frank go to get mysterious meat?
 This is the place, huh?
 This is where I can find. Just start grabbing as much stuff as you can. Ok, we'll take, um, that big brown mound and the curly stuff and then this thing looks like a blanket.
 Try some of that.
 Definitely. Oh, oh, what about a monkey? Monkeys are like nature's humans. I doubt they have monkey, Charlie. People eat monkey, Dee. They're eating type of doom. Have you ever see that? Hey. We got monkey. Oh. Well, we'll look at that. Great! Uh, one monkey also then, please. Yeah, baby. This hunt is gonna be so awesome, dude. Yeah, bud. This is what it must feel like, before you go to battle. Oh my god, I know man. I'm so exited, feel my nips.
 Holy smokes!
 They're, like, super hard, right?
 You can cut glass with these bad boys.
 I know, right? What the hell are you doing?
 I'm feeling his nips, Frank.
 Yeah, man, I'm so exited for this hunt
 and my nips are doing stuff they've never done before. Feel 'em.
 Look at these. What hunt? We're gonna hunt Cricket. I thought we went over this already. You do not hunt a man. Come on, man. Don't bring it down, not right now. Not when my nips are like this. You know you hunt a man, he can snap like a toig. Next thing you know, he's up at night, he's burning down a village of Nam, he's killing everything that moves, everything that lives! You're talking about Rambo again. Oh, no. That happened to me. Yeah, you're thinking about John Rambo's life, every time. No, I'm not. This happened to me.
 That never happened to you, Frank.
 It happened to me, Mac. Yeah, you're confused your life with Rambo again. No. No, Charlie. This is not right. I still have the crazy. I have, too.  I have even worse than before I take.
 There's something really weirdoes happening to me.
 I'll tell you what's going on. Frank bet it's human meat, and we got the hunger.
 The hunger?
 hu hum. That's how you become a cannibal, Dee. Like, you get one taste of delicious, delicious human meat, none of these stuff ever satisfies you, ever again for the rest of your life.
 Now, I just think that you're overreacting, okay?
 Oh, really? Yeah, that's stupid. Is that stupid? Oh, I'm sorry, Dee. Well, then I guess Jaws IV is stupid, ok? 'cause that's exact same plot. Ok, alright. Calm down. Before you start accusing us of becoming cannibals or sharks or whatever is you're trying to say, I think we need to find out if what we ate was actually human. Oh, shit. That's what we've been doing.
 I ate a fu** monkey, Dee.
 Charlie? You don't understand me. I think we need to try a piece of human flesh. Oh, god. just to make sure. That's the only way.
 Right?
 Ok. How're we gonna do this? The morgue? Hear me out.
 It's a dead body
 Sold. You don't even have to tell me, man. That's where you find a dead body, right?
 Great idea, right?
 We'll have a tiny little bit.
 They won't even know.
 We'll be off the hook.
 Well, no for sure.
 I got a hot plate. I wanna get some beers. Any sight of him? No, but uh, word on the street is he's out of here begging must Saturdays. He'll be here. Don't worry about it. God, hunting is awesome, Dennis.
 Yeah.
 You get to wear sweet clothes and get wasted all day. It's just like our normal lives, except at the end of it we get to put our nuts in some dude's mouth. ah yeah, actually I wanted to talk to you about that aspect of it. What's up? You're not happy with the plan? No, now look, we'd been tea-bagging Cricket since high school, you know? I feel like we need to make some progress. I think we should give him a gorilla mask. What's a gorilla mask? You put some sticky over his face, and then sprinkle it with shaved pubes. umm, no, I don't like it. What? What's not to like? Cricket with a face full of pubes? Hilarious! Yeah, but where're we supposed to get that many pubes, man?
 We shave!
 Now, that's gonna be a problem, I laser. It's like a turtle shell down there. What? Yeah, look man. The classic surculose for reason, ok?
 Why going nuts with that?
 It's called progress, Dennis. Well, I wanna make progress. So, I'm sticking with the tea-bagging. But tea-bagging doesn't even leave a mark! Well, fine, I'll dip my nuts in ink or something and then put it in his mouth, that make you happy? Well Yeah, actually, I think that's a pretty good idea. Yeah, because it leaves a mark all over it, and..
 Holy shit, let me just hunt.
 It's an excellent idea.
 It's like we can dunk him down and, like hooo~
 Cheers, man, let me went through that.
 See?  We're free thinking outside hot.
 I like it. Cricket! Get him. Get, get, get, get! Ok, how did his legs just do that?
 I'm not doing that, Dennis.
 No, that was incredibly dangerous.
 Let's go pow chop in that case.
 Did not know what he was capable of.
 Hi.
 Hey. Sorry to bug you here. How are you? I'm good. We're two friends of one of the dead people that you have in there. Close friends.
 And we wanted to..
 spent some time..
 We wanted to say good-bye.
 Say good-bye to her and or..
 to him I think
 He had a
 had long life that was good and..
 What's the hot plate for?
 The hot plate..
 The hot plate is.. because..
 our friend was a..
 He was a chef.
 a chef
 of small..
 who puts small..
 plates of 
 many small items on hot plate.
 Of course, he just heated it up. And we thought maybe if he saw or he's near to hot plate one more time Right, right, right. Look, I respect the act. I'll give you guys the same deal like I gave every else. alone with the bodies.
 What?
 What're you talking about? I must say thought, I've never seen a guy and a girl bang one of these taste at the same time.
 Are you kidding me, guy?
 Ok.
 You've got the wrong idea. That's really gross.
 Wow, you got a wrong idea about us.
 We were gonna have, we were just gonna come and have a bite a bit, I mean..
 I don't.. Wait, I don't judge you guys. It's cool.
 I like yogurt up my ass and a popsicle stick in my mouth, that's all.
 Oh my god, man.
 You know what? Let's just give this guy 15 bucks.
 I don't even know what to say. What up, man? You're the one with the hot plate.
 No, that is much worse.
 Weirdo. Ok, I'm a weirdo, says the guy, who yogurt up his ass.
 Holy shit.
 Holy shit. These are dead bodies. two dead, two dead guys. It's the real deal here. I don't think I can eat this guy. No, I don't think I can, right? What is that? I don't, I don't know.
 It's not because he's black, though, right?
 What?
 Ok, I..
 No! What, no! I still think so, no!
 It's because he's dead, right?
 It's because he's dead, that's why not. Good, good, good. Now, I got a question for you. We're racist if we don't eat this guy? Oh, shit, Charlie. Now it is. I'm sorry, Dee. I just thought white guy over here looks better than him for some reason. He looks so much better, doesn't he? What is that? I don't know, you know what it is? I generally, I don't eat dark meat. No, I've preferred the white meat. I always have.
 Yeah, so it's not that guy.
 No, it has nothing to do with that. The problem is I'm gonna have a really hard time for both cannibals and racist.
 We're not, Dee.
 I wanna just make sure. Cannibalism? Racism, Dee? That's not for us. You know, those are the decisions that're best left to the suits on Washington. Ok? We're just here to eat some dude. Well, I'm, you lost me with Washington, but the rest I agree with, so let's eat a piece of this white guy. Let's get him. I don't think I can do it.
 No, me neither.
 No. Hey, the good news is that means we're not racist.
 Yeah, I guess so.
 Ok, ok, ok. I made it. I'm fastest, I finished this lane. I beat you, bitches. Hey, shreep rat.
 Don't move!
 Hey, hey, hey! I'm not here to kill you. I'm here to help you turn the tables on Mac and Dennis. What do you mean? I wanna show those bastards today, it ain't ok to hunt humans. Yeah? They drew first blood, not you. They what? They drew first blood! What is that? Is that a Is that Rambo?
 No, I made that up.
 No, no, no.
 That's Rambo.
 You want me to help you or not? Yes, yes. Well, come on. Let's go. Get up. Tag! You're it! Holy shit! Holy shit, dude. Holy shit! Tag, you're it? And a knife? What the hell is this, man? Why are you laughing? Stop laughing, dude. This is serious shit!
 Yeah? Huh?
 What? Oh my god. Are you kidding me? You gorilla masked me? Yes! Bro, you gotta admit. I had so much more awesome than tea-bagging. Oh, yeah? Take a look at your mouth, you tell me. You put your balls in my mouth while I was sleeping?
 Yeah, man, twice.
 That's rape.
 Yeah, I know.
 That is borderline rape. Yeah, bro, you got a lot of people care.
 Not anymore. Yeah, I guess not. Jesus, man. What's with the note? I mean what's with the our tricks. No, I didn't leave it. I thought you left it. So it was Cricket. Oh, shit! Ok, Cricket got to us. He got to us. Oh, damn! He got to us, Dennis. Ok, the good news is the gorilla mask, the purple tea-bag both totally viable options, right? Ok, the bad news is.. it looks like Cricket finally snapped. We may have pushed him to far, Dennis. What do you think he's gonna do? We need to get to him first. We need to set a trap. Yeah. Then how do you catch a cricket? With a giant bird. Dee, would you calm down? You're eating that cheese steak like a some kind of giant bird, you know? I can't help it, Charlie.
 You know, I got an insatiable hunger.
 Oh, I know what that hunger is, you know?
 Stop telling me about the hunger, Ok? I'm feeling a good.
 Is it? Now, let's just go back to the morgue, ok?. This is shit. No, that place is terrible.
 Oh, none of those were terrible.
 Don't think about that. Look, Dee. We're cannibals now.
 although it's pretty obvious to me.
 I started to look that, but isn't it? That's a fact, Dee. That's what it is. Look, if we don't feed the hunger, we can die for that. It's not our fault. It's nature. That's nature! That's what happens, people die from the hunger. Oh my god. All the time that happens. We don't want that to happen. Oh my god, that happened to me. It won't happen to you? No, I want it happen to me, but I'm not going back to that morgue. Oh, we gotta do something about it. Oh, Charlie, oh, I wanted to eat that lady so bad. I did, too. I did, too.
 We're gonna have to do it.
 No, no!
 We're gonna have to find a living human being.
 No, no, you know why? I'll tell you why. Because it's dead meat, and dead meat is bad meat. No, not the morgue. I'm with you on this. on this thing.
 I never wanted that before, I wanna know.
 I know, but I wanna know. We gotta find a guy. We gotta kill that guy, and we gotta eat it. Somebody, little rotten maybe.
 Somebody..
 that nobody will start asking questions about, if he's missing.
 I mean, when we do that, we don't want any gushers.
 I don't wanna get caught.
 Someone no in the world could ever care about.
 Small change? Hungry Please help. Aho. I can't do this. They're not coming off, seriously. Oh, no, they're not going to. I used airplane glue, bro. That's gonna be your look for a while. Now, run me through how we're gonna do this with Dee. I'll talk her to it. Don't. Dee, ah, great. We need to use you as bait for our Cricket. Screw up.
 What in the hell is going on here?
 Who is this?
 No, no, we don't wanna know his name.
 Go away! No, wait, wait, Dee. What? Oh my god no.
 What are we doing?
 What? You know what kid? You gotta get out of here, man. You gotta get out of here. It's not safe here.
 We can't do this.
 No. Charlie, listen to me, listen to me good. If we don't eat this kid, we're gonna die. You know it. Oh my god, I wanna eat him as much as you wanna eat him,
 but it's wrong to do it.
 No, it's a..
 It's wrong that, going back to the street!
 Damn it! Damn it! So, you're gonna eat that kid. No, you don't know. You don't have the hunger. You know? We don't give a shit about any of these. Dee? Cricket trap bait? You? What? Hello?
 Hey, Frank.
 Hooray. Speaker, yeah, hold on. Is Dennis with you? Uh.. yeah. Good, back in Dennis, prepare to be burned alive. This is the point where I normally burn you alive, but I just did it to prove a point that I think I made my point.
 Hey, Frank. Hey, Frank.
 Hey, man.
 Hey, Franky.
 Good to see you. Good to see you, man. Hey, look.
 Can you get us more like human meat?
 Bodies, please. Are you still going on about the meat? I didn't feed you human meat. It was a raccoon.
 What?
 What? You ate raccoon meat. I told you it was people, because I wanted to freak you out, because you're stealing my food.
 No! No, no
 No, no. Then why am I always hungry? And stomach pains? And nothing satisfies the hunger? You probably got a tapeworm. Raccoon meat is lousy with parasites. Ok, are we done here? Because we're bored of shit. No, no, no, no, no. Not yet. Get ready, for a mouthful-- of strawberry blond haired, covered balls.
 Frank? Grab 'em
 We're not doing that. What do you mean? What do you mean we're not doing it.
 I lied.
 What? What, what is it with you people? I mean, you guys are always touching each other's nipples, putting your balls in each other's mouths.
 Yeah, it's fun.
 It's funny. I just don't understand your generation. Raccoon meat!
 Ball shit!
 What? That was human meat, I know it. Look, I don't give you a shit what you think.
 Oh, really?
 Yeah. I gotta chop off that pieces of that fellow calf muscle of yours, Frank. And I'm gonna eat it.
 Oh, yes. Oh, yes, Charlie.
 We're gonna put it on the hot plate, right?
 Get him!
 Oh, you can't run way from me!
 Well, I guess the hunt is all once bagan.
 Indeed, it is.
 Oh, they're gonna have so much fun, man.
 Oh, those two are gonna have blast, huh? So, I guess the only thing that's left is to figure out what to do with Mr. Cricket. Yeah, oh. What to do, what to do. Guess it's just us. It's just you and us, and a.. couple pairs of sour sweaty balls.                     How are we supposed to scale back our energy costs when you're filling this generator with gasoline? Yeah, gross. Since when did you start running the bar on a gas generator?
 About a week ago. I've been doing it for about a week.
 Why would you do that? Well, because, you know, electricity's so expensive, man. So I figured let's get a generator and, you know, run the bar on it. Are you kidding me? Gasoline's, like, a thousand times more expensive than electricity. And you know what, Charlie? You shouldn't be making these decisions anyway, okay?
 You're not the decision-making type.
 Exactly. As the brains of this organization, I should've made this decision.
 I'm sorry but when did you become the brains?
 I'm sorry I've always been the brains. What are your talking about? I thought I was the brains. What the hell am I?
 You're the looks.
 Hey of course I'm the looks, but I was seeing myself as the brains and the looks. No, you're the looks, I'm the brains, Charlie's the wild card. Oh! That's awesome. Yeah! Yeah, that's the classic setup. You know this? No? Look, every great crew in history has followed that basic dynamic, right? Looks, brains, wild card. Think about it. The A-Team did it. Scooby Doo did it.
 The Ghost busters did it.
 Oh, shit!
 Yes! Right?
 Yeah. Our problem is that we don't stick to that basic format, and it gets us into trouble. So what you're saying is that by breaking from that format, we're actually limiting our ability to be as successful as those organizations.
 Totally right, dude.
 Great. On to the matter at hand. We're getting plowed in the ass by the oil companies and the gas companies with their ten-gallon hats and their rotten, ass-plowing hearts. So, as the brains of this organization,
 I came up with a plan
 Lay it on us, bud. It involves pulling up our bootstraps, oiling up a couple of asses and doing a little plowing of our own. Pow!
 Not gay sex.
 Okay. Okay, 'cause that's what it sounded like. What did you mean?
 We're going to solve the gas crisis.
 Oh, good. Its always sunny in philadelphia 402 "The Gang Solves the Gas Crisis" Charlie, the plan is simple, okay?
 Is it?
 Yes. We go to a bank, we talk to a loan officer. We get a hefty loan to buy a bunch of gasoline. We take that gasoline, we store it in the basement, we wait a few months. When the gas prices skyrocket, we sell it, make a huge profit. Yeah, man, if the guy doesn't seem like he's going for it, I'll show him this, uh, big-breasted women chart
 and that'll win him over.
 Yeah, I'm sure it will. I mean, 'cause that's great and the plan's actually pretty great. The problem I'm having with it is that I don't have anything to do. No, you do have something to do. You're the wild card. You sit there looking crazy and capable of anything. Yeah. Yeah, you set the tone for the whole meeting. So if I'm, like, there while you guys are talking and I'm just, like, like That's terrible. That was my that was my wild card face, all right What message are you trying to send with that? Really? Was that not a good one? Well, so what if it's more like, like And you want him to think that you're going to take a dump or?
 Seriously, that's what that looks like?
 I just don't know what
 message you're trying to
 Oh, man, you're forcing it.
 Oh, my God. You know what?
 Yeah, you're really forcing it. I'd better look in a mirror 'cause I don't know what I'm doing and what it looks like feel like two different things. The Brains, I'm going to supervise 'cause there is
 no way he should be making this decision.
 Well, walk me through it, dude,
 'cause I just don't see what you're talking about.
 It's not a rape van. It's a spy van. It looks very much like a rape van to me but whatever.
 Dennis, you gotta look at this.
 What is this? Bruce Mathis is about to give away all of Mom's money. What are you talking about? In two days, some Muslim Cultural Center is about to get a giant check made out of our cash, and we've got to get that back. Listen, this jamoke is giving our money to terrorists, and we've got to prove it. Dee, Mom gave all of our money to Bruce. You were never going to get it anyway. Oh, no-no-no, I was. See, I had a plan. I was going to eliminate everybody else and be the only surviving heir, so help. So when you say "eliminate," you mean you were going to kill me? I don't know. No, yes, maybe I was going to; maybe I wasn't. The point is moot now. So can you please help me out here? So you were planning on killing me? Stop arguing. Are you going to help us out? We got no time here. Pass.
 "Pass"?
 Yeah, pass.
 Super-pass, berpass
 How do you super-pass on something like this I pass! I pass! Because you were planning on killing me. Oh, my God, I feel like you're really focused on one tiny part of what I'm trying to talk about here.
 It's a very big part of your
 It's just a couple of words.
 Go away. I'm trying to draw breasts and pretty women.
 Focus on the words "money" and "Bruce" and "me" and "help." All right, and what is the reason you're requesting a loan today? Wait for it
 Gasoline.
 Excuse me.
 Don't rush me.
 Don't rush him. Thank you, I feel rushed. Look, here's the plan. You give us a shitload of money. We buy a shitload of gasoline. We wait 12 months, we sell the gasoline and make a shitload of profit. Gentlemen, we tend to give loans to businesses, not
 She's not getting it. Get the graph.
 Oh, yeah, the graph.
 We have a graph.
 Yeah, check this out. Now these are the gas prices last year. These are the gas prices this year. And this is what the gas prices will be. And what are those? These are gorgeous women with heaving breasts. Yeah. Why? Well, to be perfectly honest, we sort of thought we'd
 be speaking to a man today, so
 Yeah, is there any way that we can talk to your boss because I think he would understand more better? My boss is a woman.
 Really?
 Your boss is a woman? Now, this is a strange bank. Okay, well, I am definitely rejecting your request for $300,000 to buy gasoline.
 Dennis, you're on.
 Yeah. You know I just had a crazy thought. How's about I take you in the back and "change" your mind? Or how about we all go in the back and have great sex?
 What are you doing, hmm?
 I'm pulling a wild card here, man, so No, dude, just let Dennis do his thing, okay? I can be very sensual with a woman, all right? You will enjoy it. Now is not the right time to pull the wild card, okay? Let me do my thing. Let me do the seducing.
 Let Dennis bang her so we can get our loan.
 Well, here's a scenario. What if she wanted to bang me or you for that matter? You can't pull the wild card when I already have my shirt off, that should be a rule. Can that be a rule?
 Yes, that's a rule.
 Oh, yeah?! Oh, yeah?! Back off!
 Come on, man, let me do it. This is my job!
 Wild card, baby!
 Dude, I feel like I can do it then, too.
 What are you doing?!
 Goddamn it, look, okay, so
 Why don't you decide?
 Yeah.
 Which one of us do you want to take you in the back and bang you? My intel tells me that Bruce moved into this crappy apartment complex.
 Where'd you get your intel?
 I water boarded some guy.
 Told me everything.
 You tortured somebody? Oh, yeah. Big time. What do you see? I can't see shit. Why would you tint the inside of the windows?
 I don't want anybody to see in.
 We can't see out, Frank!
 I might've overdone it a little bit.
 You think so?
 That's Bruce!
 This guy? That's the guy, walking there! Walking there!
 Start the car. Let's go! Let's follow him!
 Are you sure that's him? Gonna take some pictures. I got it working.
 Go! Go!
 All right, there's
 the gas pedal's stuck or something.
 Well, wobble it.
 "Wobble it"?
 Yeah, wobble it back and forth.
 Wiggle it. Wiggle it. That's it. That's it.
 All right.
 Now, hit it. Oh, God
 What are you trying to do? Give me whiplash? You're blinding me. Will you calm down? Hold on. Son of a bitch! Hey, assholes. Hey, what the hell was that about?! I can't believe Dee keeps her life savings in her sock drawer. That's a dumb place to hide it. She's an investor now. She'll thank us later. You know what, guys? I'm sorry. I got to bring something up. Can I bring something up? 'Cause if it don't, it's going to stew up inside me.
 It's going to drive me crazy.
 What's up, man? I kind of can't believe that you guys took your shirts off back there, man. I mean, I feel like you really sold me down the river. The Ghostbusters would never do something like that to each other.
 I can't believe you guys did it, man.
 What are you doing? No trash cans, only cars. Whoa, cool your jets, guy. We paid for this gas. It's going to be a while, so Stop now. You can't do this.
 Come on, man.
 Only cars. Oh, geez. All right, Wild Card, do your thing. So help me God, I'll blow this place to kingdom come.
 Not that, not that. Jesus Christ, Charlie.
 Come on, man. No, we just got to figure out a way to get this gas back to
 the bar without using the barrels.
 Well, how the hell we gonna do that? All right, barrel number six is done, dudes.
 This doesn't seem to be the best
 No. Guys, this is not working, okay? We're actually losing money driving back and forth from that
 gas station all day long.
 You're burning up our product. Plus I have swallowed a good deal of it. It's just a damn waste. Yeah, and gas has gone up seven cents since this morning. He puts a new thing on the sign every time we pull in there.
 We're screwing ourselves here, guys.
 Hold on, let's not freak out.
 Let's not freak out.
 The plan's not working though, man. We just need to adjust our business model to meet the needs
 of a changing market place. That's all.
 That's money talk. Let's talk money. We got to make some money in the short term. Well, how the hell are we going to do that? I got a plan.
 We'd like to return some gas, please.
 Yeah. Don't worry, bro, got receipts. I can't do that. You can't do it or you won't do it? Both. Not yet, buddy. Okay, bro, want to play hard ball, fine. You're about to experience the hard knocks of a free market, bitch. Get ready to feel it where it hurts.
 Your dick.
 No, no, not his dick. His wallet.
 Your wallet.
 Yep. Here we are. This is it.
 Are you sure this is the place?
 Yes, yes, yes, my intel says so. Okay, take these box cutters, put them in his bedroom. Take this fertilizer, toss it in the closet. What the hell are we doing that for? 'Cause when I call the cops on him, they'll come and find all this bomb-making shit and they'll arrest his money-stealing ass. We don't want to call the cops. They'll find the bug I'm going to plant. That's a baby monitor, Frank. You're planting a baby monitor? Yeah? A lot of people are bugging their babies these days. I guess babies can't be trusted. What exactly is it you're expecting to find here?
 Lotta shady shit.
 Like what? Like maybe Bruce is banging dudes. Why would that be shady?
 Maybe the dudes are babies.
 What?! Bruce is not banging any baby dudes. Look, we're going back to the original plan, okay? We're going to put the frame on him. We're going to be heroes among the community and I'm going to get all of my money back as a reward.
 All my money.
 Whatever. It was probably going to end up mine eventually, so Okay, there's something I want to talk to you about. Were you planning on offing me and then offing Dennis also? Frank, we are in the middle of something. I don't have time to chitchat with you about stuff. Were you planning on offing me?
 I didn't say that.
 You didn't deny it either. Deny it? Do I have to deny something so craz Give me the baby monitor. I'll hide it for you. Capitalism at work. This ought to show the son of a bitch. All right, buddy, now explain to me how exactly we're going to
 calculate the totals.
 Oh, it's easy, dude. You pour gas into the car using one of these funnels, right? And I count how much gas is going into the car. All right, let me just stop you right there. How exactly are you planning on counting a liquid?
 I know how to count, dude.
 Okay, you do it, you do it,
 Mac, because I can't speak to him.
 Free Market 101, you got to have customers to have a working business, right?
 So we've got to attract attention.
 Yeah. I, for one, suggest me blowing fireballs to get that attention. Fireballs?
 Where is that coming from?
 No, rifling fireballs around No, people will see it from the street and pull in. They'll want to buy the gas. We have ten containers of gasoline.
 Charlie, the lighter, please.
 What the hell No, no, no.
 Let me reiterate my strong opposition to this idea.
 Trust me, Dennis, I know what I'm doing. This is really unsafe, dude. Do not blow that fireball Wow. Okay, wow, I take back everything I just said. That was amazing. Oh, dude, I'm doing one of those, baby.
 You can do it bigger?
 No, Charlie, let me Make sure it's bigger. Wait Goddamn it! You burned my head!
 Oh, I did. I burned him.
 Really? Easy, camper, easy, camper.
 Jesus Christ! How can I relax?
 Relax.
 OK, OK?
 Just stop. Just stop. Do you have anything other than a towel and duct tape? Not really. New plan we're going to a hospital. you know what, bro, actually we're going to be done with your plans for a little while. 'Cause the system you set up, it ain't working. So I got a new system. Me both the brains and the looks. Charlie, you're still going to be the wild card 'cause that fireball you blew was badass. It was great, right? You just kind of got in the way. Mac, check this out though. You're going to be the muscle. No, I I think we've got to stick to the paradigm that we set up.
 The A-Team
 No, no, no!
 Your paragon is failing us, man.
 It's a paradigm, but yeah.
 It wasn't working.
 It's not working. What happened was, we confused your bossiness with braininess, and those two are very different things. That is what happened. So, check it out. Man, I got a new plan.
 This is what we're going to do, okay, baby?
 Yeah. We're going to steal Frank's rape van because driving around with all that gasoline is ruing the interior of my car,
 and I just I won't have it.
 No. Then we're going to take that van, and we're going to offer people something that gas stations just can't offer. What? Gasoline directly to their doorsteps. Door-to-door gasoline salesmen. Oh, my God, that's amazing.
 That's a brilliant plan, right?
 All right, whatever, fine. Then I'll be the muscle. I'll muscle these pricks into buying the gas. Ooh, actually why don't you muscle you way back by the van,
 because you look like a burned-up freak.
 You know what? A look is going to be a big part of this. I'm going to get some disguises. Why would we need disguises, Charlie? So people don't know who we are, you know. They already don't know who we are. You're not letting the wild card do his thing. Is there any reason behind what you're doing? Wild card. Stewart's up on his second shot on the fairway, hole 15. I'd say it's about 195 yards. He has a seven iron. I mean, how has he been sitting there watching golf for three hours?
 I don't know.
 Is that a baby monitor? Oh, cut it off! Goddamn it!
 Now he's suspicious of us!
 Oh, no!
 You are such a bad hider.
 I'm a bad hider? You-you never could hide. I bet you still hide your money in your sock drawer.
 My sock drawer.
 Yeah. Come on. That would be stupid.
 Yeah, you do.
 Just shut up.
 You're lying to me.
 I'm not lying to you.
 I'm getting out of here. This is a setup.
 What? You're setting me up, and I'm getting the hell out. Frank, get back here. You're not gonna do this to me, girl. Get out of here.
 I understand what's going on.
 Damn it. Okay, they're on the move.
 Hey. Son of a bitch.
 I know what's going on. You think I was born yesterday?
 Okay, go, go, go, Mac, go.
 What are you talking about? Yeah, don't-don't lie to me. I have my ways of finding out things. You're being so Oh, my God. Is that a Muslim guy? He's getting in my van. Come on, dude, seriously? All right, well, just let me do the talking. Well, I feel like you got to at least talk with a Southern accent, man. I'm not gonna talk in a Southern accent. It's bad enough that you wore this stupid disguise. But we're oil men. We would have Southern accents. Yeah, but we don't need bolo ties and stupid hats. Yes, you do. She's gonna think, uh Hello, ma'am. Well, what a lovely housedress. Yeah, well, you're looking all sorts of good. Now, you seem like a sweet, sophisticated, nice, busy, young lady, so we're not gonna waste your time today. Nah. We're just a couple oil men in from Dallas, and, well, we're itching like a hound to give you a-something you want. What my associate is trying to say is that we're here to offer your community a much-needed service Hells, yeah! We want to feel you up, if'n you were so inclined as to let us. Please, let me do the talking. Please, let me Now, we ain't gonna take no for an answer now, you hear? Okay? So don't be making me sic my associate on you here, all right? He don't take kindly to "no." So, can I feel you up or what? Yep, you best get to stepping, because Johnny Law's a-coming. You might want to start driving because she called the cops on us. Why's he talking like that? Well, wild card over here decided to lose his mind. I say, I say, that's just damn preposterous, boy. Well, now you're just talking like Foghorn Leghorn! All right, guys, I think it's time we cut our losses and go back
 to the original plan.
 Ah, the generator. No, not the generator.
 Storing the gas and patties.
 All right. Okay? It's too soon to sell this gas anyway, so shut the door.
 Go, go, go, go.
 Okay, okay, okay. All right, admit it, that Muslim guy was gonna rub me out, and that's when you jumped out of the van after I got out! Admit it, come on! Oh, my God, I don't know what you're talking about! Oh, don't lie to me! Come on, admit it! Okay, okay, I admit it!
 What do you admit?!
 I admit anything you want to hear! Now, you admit that Bruce Mathis is a terrorist
 He's a terrorist!
 and that you are working for him! Yes, I work for him. We get our information from the top, the top cave. Don't bullshit me! That's all I got to say! Like what I'm seeing here, Frank. Bring me up to speed. I'm waterboarding your sister because she's
 escalating the plot to kill us.
 Dennis, help me! Why the hell would I help you, Dee? You're still plotting to kill me.
 No! Help!
 Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
 Yeah, shut up.
 Tell me what's going on! Hey, Frank, by the way, we borrowed that pathetic rape van of yours; you got to get that gas pedal fixed, man. Mac rammed into some dude's car, like, five times. It was amazing. You guys took the van? I thought it was some Muslim guy.
 No, not really.
 What is going on in here?
 Frank's waterboarding Dee.
 You guys?! You took the van?!
 Well, hell, yeah.
 Oh, my God, I just realized something. Frank is the muscle. What? The reason that shit hasn't been working out for us is because we are not working with our full crew. I'm the brains, you're the looks, Charlie's the wild card, and Frank is the muscle.
 Well, what's Dee?
 She's the useless chick. Yeah!
 You see? We complete it!
 Yeah! We all complete the team! Now, if we stick together, guys, we can do anything. Now, question: Frank, does that waterboard really work? You bet your ass! I got Dee to admit to things she never did! Well, then it works. All right, then, gentlemen, I got a new plan. Bruce's, we slip in and we grab him. Shouldn't you guys have gotten these barrels out of the
 van before we got in?
 They're really heavy, Dee. We've already had to do it, like, a million times.
 Where'd you get the money for this gas?
 Dee, will you shut up and let me continue? Now, Frank, when we get back to the bar, you waterboard the shit
 out of Bruce and get a confession.
 No problem. Now, Dennis, you take that confession to the police, use your charm and good looks, and get that reward money.
 Done and done.
 Okay, Dee, you continue to be useless. Charlie and I will use that reward money to pay off our electricity bill. Then we'll probably buy some more gasoline 'cause I feel like that's a great plan. Wait. Brakes don't Brakes don't work.
 The gas pedal.
 No, I'm saying, no, the brakes!
 Wiggle the gas pedal.
 Guys, why aren't the brakes working? Because I cut the brakes! Wild card, bitches!
 What?! Charlie!
 Holy shit!
 Oh, God!
 Oh, my God! Oh, God! Jesus Christ, guys, I can't stop this van!
 Seriously?!
 Abort! Abort! Go! Mastersfield steps up to the tee, eight strokes behind the leader. Hole number 17, 338 yards, dogleg left. Oh, goddamn it! What the hell, man?! Ah, my van. Why is someone trying to ruin my life?! I didn't do anything to anybody, man! I love that car! That's, uh, that's not Bruce, is it? No. If there's something strange In your neighborhood Who you gonna call? Ghostbusters!                       you better have a good reason for getting us out of bed this early, jerk. I got a goddamn great reason for getting you out of bed. This bar is hemorrhaging money. You gotta spend money to make money: Economics 101, dude. You're bleeding us to death, especially with that company credit card you got. That is for business expenses, Frank. Everything on there is a business expense. Who spent $500 for laser hair removal? Right over here, slick. Don't want to have hair down there. You know what I'm saying? Who spent $5,000 for a samurai sword? Your head of security. Yeah. Just wait till he saves your life one day with it. $6,000 on a camcorder. Well, I decided what I'm going to do is I'm going to take all those hilarious characters that I've been creating over the past several years, to put them on tape, I'm going to put them on YouTube. That way, I can get discovered by, like, a casting director or a producer, get some kind of a TV development deal. Yeah, right. So the point is, Frank, is that these are all business expenses. I mean, some are definitely more realistic than others.
 Yeah. Not that one.
 No, not at all. But, nonetheless, it was, I believe, bought as a business expense. They're not business expenses. What I bought is a business expense. What I bought is something that's going to save our asses. Okay. Yeah. All right.
 What did you get?
 I bought a billboard. its always.sunny in philly 403 Okay, so I'm thinking we write on the billboard, in nice big letters, "We have two-for-one drink specials on Thursdays." And, on the bottom, you have a hilarious picture of Green Man kicking someone in the nuts. And people will go, "Hey, what's this wacky place?
 Where can I have those drinks?"
 It is really astonishing how bad your idea is.
 How is that a bad idea?
 Go sit down. The adults are working. The adults are working. When we need a child, we'll call you. Dennis, you and I on the same team. Hot chick up on the billboard.
 Sex sells. Boom.
 absolutely. It's Advertising 101: long legs, taut breasts and tight poopers. I'm just going to jump in here real quick and point out that this is the point in the conversation where I would volunteer to be the girl on the billboard, and then you guys would talk about how ugly you think I am, and compare me to
 some sort of giant bird.
 You look so much like a bird.
 Dennis, I was thinking fish recently.
 Really? Yeah. Her eyes are so far apart, they're like they're on Okay, okay, but I don't want to be on your billboard. I'm not going to ask to be because you wouldn't let me be on it anyway. No. That's sensible. You don't even have to ask. There's no way you can be up on that billboard.
 Let me get the point out! The point is
 She's better than you. I don't want to be on your billboard, and I'll tell you why. I'm going to take one of my characters and I'm going to launch a viral video and promote Paddy's myself. A viral video? There's about a billion of those on YouTube. Who gives a shit? you think anyone gives a shit about a billboard? Wake up, donkeys. The Internet is where it's at, and I'm going to be an Internet sensation. You're totally right. If you don't mind, I'm going to come with you. Maybe I can throw Green Man into a couple of your videos, you know, and work it out. That'll get a lot of hits. You can help me out, Charlie, but we're not going to put Green
 Man into anything.
 Well, we'll see about that.
 We'll see about that.
 Well, we will. All right. Later, dudes! "S" you in your "A"s, don't wear "C"s, and "J" all over your "B"s. Why would he not want a "C"? I don't even know what he's talking about half the time, bro, but hey, Frank, I'm glad you're here, bro.
 We're talking billboard ideas.
 Don't waste your time. I know what the billboard's going to look like already: two gorgeous girls up there, giant cans, me in the middle with my thumbs up. Well, that's just simply not going to happen. Actually, maybe Frank has a point, dude. Maybe weshouldput a dude up there, certainly not him. but if we put some hot beefcake up there, maybe it will attract more chicks. That's a good point. Okay, I like that. Let's slapmypicture up there. It's about time I got my modeling career off the ground anyway. Don't flatter yourself. You're not going to be up there because I'm going to be the face
 of Paddy's Bar.
 That's ridiculous, Frank. You're ugly. What? Ugly?
 I'm ugly?
 Yeah. With that anteater nose, you're telling meI'mugly. My nose was chiseled by the gods themselves, Frank. My body was sculpted to the proportions of Michelangelo's David. You, on the other hand, well you're a pit of despair. Frank, you disgust me. You disgust everyone. And you will never, ever be on that billboard. Good morning, Philadelphia! I'm Crazy Paddy, and I'm coming to you from Paddy's Pub, telling you to come on down. We're slashing prices so low you won't need a pot of gold to get sloppy. So come on down to Paddy's. It's insane!
 What is that?
 Did you like that? No. That's not what YouTube videos are like.
 that's a great character.
 No, That's like a bad late-night commercial you'd see, like, on the cable network or something. Maybe you didn't get it. I'm crazy 'cause I'm pricing the beer too low. I think I got it. I think I got it. The beer's too low for what average beer prices are. All right, you know what? Let's just do it again, maybe throw in some more jokes or something, you know?
 Make it funnier.
 You're absolutely right. You can make it funnier. you're a funny girl. You ready? Good morning, Philadelphia. I'm Crazy Paddy. Oh, my God! Why? Now, that was funny. Dee, that's awesome!
 what do you that?
 That's what YouTube video is. That's funny? You ever see those girls mashing the grapes, and then
 slips and she's, like?
 Why did you do that, Charlie?
 That's what people want to see.
 Oh, my God! People getting injured or seriously hurt-- that's funny! Okay? Let's just do this. This is Trust me. This is what gets hits on YouTube.
 All right. Are you ready?
 Yeah. I was ready from Stop talking. I'm crazy Patty Nope. Okay. I'm Crazy Patty What are you doing? You're lunging every time now. I'm sorry. I can't concentrate when I'm about to get blasted in the face with a ball. I'll blast you all over if you flinch again. Let's just do this. Let's just do this. Action! Goddamn!
 Goddamn!
 That is funny. I don't like it, Charlie. I don't think it's funny. It doesn't hurt too bad. Bro, can you believe how many hot chicks showed up for a casting call for a billboard? How have we not done this before? Yeah. Yeah, man. Plus, think about it. Dennis Reynolds, 40 feet tall and shirtless.
 it's going to be so perfect!
 Let's go.
 Just take your places over there.
 Frank, what are you doing?
 We're looking for models, right?
 Yeah. I went on a stud hunt. I came back with beefcake. What are you talking about, Frank? I'm the male model. Rex? Rex? What are these guys for? We don't need Rex. Take your shirt off. Come on, you don't need to take your shirt off. well, okay, if you're looking for that Now, that, that is what you call a stallion. That is a stallion. I didn't know you guys were looking for a stallion. I'm a stallion. Dennis, you think Frank's got a point here? I don't think he has a point. I'm a stallion. All right, this is messy. look, buddy, 2003 Dennis, okay, he was Grade-A prime beefcake. No one is disputing that. He was a stallion. But 2008 Dennis is in decline. Take a look at Rex here. That is a body that just won't quit. I bet if you pop those pants off, you're gonna find a bird that just won't quit either. And I think that'll come in handy in this situation. I think the problem here is that your body quit. Your bird quit. And unfortunately, it's no longer legit. What the hell you talking about, my bird? All right, let's get back to business here. Attention, ladies, I'm gonna need all the A cups to please head for the back door. Charlie, are you ready with the camera? Yeah, I'm trying to set it up. It takes a second, Dee. All right, who the hell's this character you're doing? this one? It's a really great one. Her name's Martina Martinez, and she is a streetwise Puerto Rican girl who's always quick with a sassy comeback.
 Are you serious?
 Yes, it's awesome. Now let's go over what we're doing again. I go up, I talk, you come in with the volleyball, you hit him in the face, and you get out of there. Okay. I'm gonna hit a random person in the face with a volleyball. But don't come in too early 'cause I got some material I want to do and I don't want you to cut me off this time. Saturday Night Live is gonna, I think they're gonna really love this.
 Do you really think that?
 Charlie, Charlie, go, go, go. I'm horrified that he's even here. excuse me. Can I talk to you use? What? Youse a bunch of white boys, right? Can I axe you a question? When you be in the clubs and you be dancing, why you look so stupid? I'm just playin'. So youse a big man, right? But you got such tiny boots on. That means you got a small pecker. I'm sorry. I'm just playin'. I'm Martina Martinez. Okay, attention, ladies, gentlemen, hotties and beefcakes. You were brought here because you are the most beautiful people in all of Philadelphia. And as such, the honor has been bestowed upon all of you to compete in Paddy's first Next Top Billboard Model contest.
 What's the pay?
 What?! What is the pay? The pay, sir, is getting your face 40 feet up on a billboard.
 So there's no pay then?
 I just told you what the pay is. He told you what the goddamn pay was.
 The billboard thing.
 Were you not listening?
 Well, I'm outta here.
 Fine. Fine. You leave. We don't need you people. Everybody else. Let's take their lack of dedication as a lesson, shall we? Competitions like this aren't about money. They're about fame. They are about putting yourself on display to the world and saying, "I'm good enough because I beat everyone else,
 and I got myself up on a billboard."
 Not so fast. What the hell are you doing here? I want in the competion. Approach. Dennis, I told you you don't have the right stuff. I got the right stuff, Frank. I can win this thing, I know it. All right, judges' side bar. Do you want to let him in? Bro, he's been talking about this modeling thing for years. If only to shut him up.
 You're in.
 Oh, yeah! Yes! Huh? You Okay, the first competion is the underwear competion. Boom! How's your face, Dee? How do you think it is, Charlie? You kept hitting me over and over in the same spot with a volleyball. And I was explicitly clear: no more Green Man. Come on. Green Man's what makes this thing work. Green Man is not what makes it work, Charlie. My characters are what make it work. No more Green Man. And we're not doing it anymore. All right. Geez, relax. You're nothing without Green Man. shit. Dee, you know what? This is all like a bad frame and stuff. This isn't gonna work. We got to do it again. What? The camera was too low. We got to Hey, diary. It's me. It's Thursday, September I'm alone, of course, again. And I just had a little bit too much ice cream. Interesting. Okay, Frank, can I talk to you for a second? What's up? Bro, originally, my plan was to just bang a bunch of models, right? Okay, but after talking to a few of them, I feel like I could find my true love here. You think you could fall in love with one of these broads? Yeah, dude, eventually, I got to settle down, right? Spread my seed. Haven't you ever seen The Bachelor? Look, you get a whole bunch of them together, you make them compete over you, bing-bang-boom, soulmate. that sounds good. Well, okay, you take the girls, and I'll take Dennis and the dudes.
 Really?
 Yeah.
 You'll just give me the girls?
 Absolutely.
 I can have my own competition.
 Awesome. I don't understand it, but I don't care.
 All right, thanks, bud.
 All right. See ya. All right, whatever. Thank you. All right, where are all my male models? Come forward. Come forward. Okay, as you know, in the world of modeling, you're sometimes asked to model a theme. Today's theme is barnyard. Okay, everybody, come on the stage that I have prepared to give you a little ambience. Okay, here's a baby pool that you're all going to get into. And there's a lot of hay and there's some chickens and ducks. What the hell, bro? Is this supposed to be dirt? It smells like shit. It is shit. This is a barnyard. No one is going to step in shit. Rex, are you kidding me? Seriously, are you just gonna step right in it? I want to win, bro. Billboard. Dee, what is this getup? What are you doing now? What is that? okay. This is Taiwan Tammy. She on runway and do a drag queen in nails. thank you! Are you kidding me? That is extremely racist. Isn't it awesome? I'm so excited about this one. All right, well, good luck to you on that. Why are you hands in your pockets? They're itchy.
 Your hands are itchy?
 My hands are a little itchy. Your hands are in your pockets 'cause they're itchy? Goddamn it! I knew it! Charlie, what are you doing?
 I said no Green Man!
 Green Man sells this whole thing. It doesn't make any sense! Goddamn it, Charlie!
 Hey, I know you.
 What? Yeah, you that, that girl, PatheticGirl43. PatheticGirl? I almost didn't recognize you in that getup, but I recognize that whiny voice anywhere. Hey, you mind if we get a picture together? Yeah, let's get a picture. I can't believe you recognized us. You saw the YouTube thing, right? Charlie, what is going on? I'll show you later. In other news, it seems like I have a rash in a place where a sexually active person should have a rash. Green Man! Oh, my God, you put that on YouTube?
 Oh, my God, I totally did.
 Charlie, why would you do that to me?
 Because that's great stuff.
 That was my private video diary.
 80,000 hits.
 80,000?
 Big numbers.
 Yeah, come on. Don't take this to heart. Don't take this the wrong way. Hey, look, you got recognized on the street today.
 That happened.
 So did I.
 Well, it was me first.
 But the point is that's the first step to becoming hugely famous
 Pretty awesome.
 is people noticing you on the Internet
 80,00 hits.
 That's a lot of hits, Charlie. You know what it's like for Chocolate Rain
 when he goes around in the world?
 He gets free food. He gets free everything because people love that guy. Charlie, fire up that video camera. There you go. Okay, Anya, so they are in fact, double Ds. That's great news. Well, you got a great look, no denying that. Let me ask you a question, though. Why should I pick you over the other girls? I'm willing to do anything in order to win. You're talking about banging me, right? Maybe.
 If you say yes
 Yes. Okay, great. You said yes. Okay, Anya said yes. That's written down now. That's like a contract. All right, perfect. Can't go back on it. All right, well, thank you for coming in.
 Thank you.
 Nice talking to you.
 You, too.
 You got a great shot. You got a great ass. All right.
 Hi.
 Hi. Rochelle. Yes. Rochelle, Rochelle, Rochelle. Thank you for coming in. I'm having all the girls come in just to make sure we vibe. Of course. What's the difference between you and the rest of the girls? Well, my heart is in this 100% and for more than just a billboard. For more than a billboard? That's interesting. I haven't heard that yet. No? I feel like there's vibing happening right now. This is the vibing I'm talking about. Yeah. I feel like we're completing each other's  sentences. Yeah, I was gonna say sentences!
 I know.
 Oh, my God!
 How did you read my?
 mind? I was gonna say "head," but that's okay, that's all right. We got, we're one for two.
 Okay.
 That's okay. 50%. You and I are gonna get along very well. Rex, that is a sexy jaguar. I mean, that jaguar is fierce! I've never been turned on by a jaguar before. This has totally changed my mind toward jaguars. Dennis, your mule is shit. I'm no longer turned on by mules. You gave Rex jaguar! There aren't jaguars in barns. What the hell am I supposed to do with a mule? You can't make a mule sexy. Dennis, you've been out modeled. I have not been out modeled. I haven't even begun to work this hot body. What's the next event? The clothes-off pose-off. Jesus Christ, Frank. I got burns! What are you doing? Anything can happen on a runway, Dennis. Nobody's gonna throw detergent in my eyeballs on a runway, Frank! And you think that was bad. Check out this tasty delight. You got to eat cockroaches next. You know what, man? Screw this. I'm outta here. Finished. Jesus, Rex, I didn't tell you to start eating yet. That doesn't disqualify me, does it? No, you're good. hey, diary. Listen, today was the worst day ever. I had an audition, and I didn't get the part, which is really, really strange for me. But then the casting director called, and they were, like, "We thought you were just better for a different part." And I was, like, "That makes more sense."
 Cut, cut!
 What are you doing? That was great. What are you doing? Why don't you do it like you did the first time? Dee, this is just weird. This is what I do. I just talk into the camera about my life. Are you kidding? You never do this. You have all these colors on your face, your mouth is going like this. Don't bust my balls. This is great exposure for me.
 This is stupid, Dee.
 Hey, Charlie, you are here.
 what the hell's going on?
 I don't know.
 Doesn't she look ridiculous?
 Get out of here! What are you doing here?
 He almost didn't recognize you?
 Are you guys shooting a porn?
 No, we're not
 Never mind. I don't care. Listen, we need to get that company credit card from Frank.
 Yeah? What's up?
 Dude, I realized something. I don't need validation anymore. How great is that? But what I do need is I need the company credit card so that I can buy myself a billboard, get myself out there and show the entire world that Dennis Reynolds still has a rocking body that deserves to be worshipped. Get out of here! We're in the middle of something.
 No, you get out of here.
 Get out! Help me get the credit card. I need that billboard! Hang on a second. Okay, look, guys, guys, there's a way to make you guys both happy, all right? I got a pretty good plan how to do this. Hey, everybody, PatheticGirl43 here coming to you live with Philadelphia's next hot model Dennis Reynolds. Dennis, tell us what it's like to be so handsome. Well, I like to think I've been this handsome since birth, possibly even earlier. Green Man! This shamrock will be awarded to the winner as a symbol of my vote and love for this competion. Rochelle, you taught me about love, respect, inner beauty. Dominique, you banged me, like, right away. I hardly had to do anything. Tabitha, you did the same. But most importantly, you banged each other. And you let me watch. Awesome. But when I was making this decision, I thought long and hard and I thought, "I have to go with my heart. I have to go with my heart." So I'm gonna do something a little unorthodox here. A top of the morning to both of you! What? I had two of them. I had another one here. I tricked you. I got both of you guys. But you just said that I taught you about inner beauty and respect. Yeah, but this whole thing's about banging, and you didn't bang me, so
 You're a dick!
 I know. And that's what I learned. Check it out. Check it out!
 What is it?
 I'll tell you what it is, bitch. It's a YouTube video that me, Dee and and Charlie just made that's gonna get a million hits. So guess what, pal. Don't need your billboard. I'm going viral. I'm glad you don't need it because you can't have it because it's already up. What? Yeah, I put it up right after you called me ugly. There's no billboard? Oh, yeah, sorry about that, Rex. My bad. So wait. If you already put the billboard up, what'd you put on it?                       Okay, it's 2:30 on a Wednesday, Philadelphia, PA. Hello, America. Mac here with another installment of Project Bad ass. As you can see, the ramp is about 40 feet down there. I will now light the pyrotechnics which are attached at the arms and back and all over my pants. 'Cause I know what it means Totally and completely badass. Here we go. Three, two, one
 Oh, Jesus.
 You see what I was going for, right?
 How badass is that?
 You know what, man? I actually found that to be pretty goddamn entertaing.
 Yeah, dude.
 I got to be honest with you.
 Now you have some more of those?
 Oh, man, I got a shitload of those. Yeah. I've been working my ass off on these videos. Now has Charlie seen these? I bet he would love 'em. Yeah, I showed it to him. He acted like he liked it in fact he even asked me to keep one of the videocassettes for multiple views and then when I wasn't around, I saw him smashing one. Smashing it? Dude, I don't know what his problem is, but he's been completely pissing me off recently. I worked so hard on those tapes. Why? Why? To show how badass I am. Code Red! Code Red, guys! Guys, we got a Code Red on our hands! Oh, my God, check it out. Now according to my sources in the field, the waitress is seeing somebody.
 Do you know who this guy is?
 No. I have no idea, man. I just got a shady read-out of the guy. I tell you what, Mac, seeing as how you're my best friend maybe you can look into it for me. You know, go down there, snoop around the shop. Can I stop you for a second? I'm sorry, I'm a little confused here. You just said that he was your best friend. How is he your best friend over me? Well, I mean, you banged the waitress. do I even have to explain that to you? That kind of rubbed me the wrong way, dude. I mean, you know, I don't see how that should factor in to whether we're best friends or not. You know, to be honest with you, man, I'm a little shocked. I'm kind of I'm thunder struck. I'm sorry, man, but you know, I didn't mean to hurt you, I didn't mean to thunder strike you, but that's I don't know what else to tell you. What do you want to hear? I need for you to explain to me how it is that you consider
 Mac to be a better friend to you.
 This is just becoming awkward. When I have a real problem, and all of a sudden, it's about some weird feelings thing. And it's not about your feelings right now, it's about my feelings 'cause I have a problem, okay? Now, Mac, please, do you think you can find this guy and kick his ass for me? Absolutely, bro. I will find this guy and I will kick his ass. And you know why? Because you and I are best friends. He's on to us. its always sunny in philly 404 Hey, what's up, buddy?
 Hey, man.
 How are you? Good. So look, I'm only going to be here like a night or two, until Mac and I take care of a little business. Okay, listen, man, you stay as long as you want to, man, 'cause that's what, you know, that's what friends do: they let each other stay at each other's apartments,
 and they hang out with each other, and
 Absolutely. And we can do that, do some bonding, go over the best friend
 thing a couple more times.
 Yeah, bro? Where are you going with that? I was just going to throw your sleeping bag in my room. 'Cause you can stay with me. yeah I was going to stay in Mac's room. I'm sure he wouldn't mind. Hey, my room's a lot bigger. I was going to stick with the plan here, so Okay, listen, man, since you're here and you've got all this beer, let's crack a couple of them open. Let's get tipsy. Yeah, but the beer is for me and Mac, you know, to
 It doesn't have to be though.
 to celebrate the ass-kicking. Well, I mean there's 24 beers there, if I'm counting right.
 12 for me and 12 for Mac.
 12 for Mac That's sort of our thing that we do. You guys are really going to drink that many, just the two of you tonight? We could do something else. Let's do something else. Hey, board games, man. Let's have a board game night. Chinese checkers, I got
 That's kind of foreign, so
 I got I got Clue, you know, we could solve a mystery together.
 We could
 Complicated stuff there. What about Connect Four?
 Connect Four's a fun game.
 I don't like counting. It's not that much counting. It's just one, two, three, and then four, you win. But a lot a lot of times, you got to count that much. Not that many times. If you get it once, you've won the game. So you're
 Have you ever spent any
 Kind of in
 I'm in your way.
  in my way. I'm in your way. Cool. hey, let's watch a movie. That's simple. That doesn't require any We could just sit down and, like, watch I bought I bought a bunch of new DVDs. Yeah I got a lot of work to do. what are you? What is that? Oh, nothing. Just got a couple long-range walkie-talkies. Oh, cool. Did you get one for me? I did not. Oh, that's all right. I mean we could probably just Who has, who has the other one? Mac probably. All right, let's do this.
 What are you doing?
 Popping my pants off.
 Why?
 Because we're gonna bang. To shove it into Charlie's face for smashing my tape. How many times do we have to go through this? Dude, look, I know what your little plan is, but if I'm going to bang you, it's going to be on my own terms, okay? There's some things that I need from you. All right, whatever. I'll wear the goddamn condom, but I'm not psyched about it. This isn't about condoms. What? Do you really not wear condoms when you have sex with strangers?
 Why would I wear a condom?
 Okay, I don't care. I don't care. You know what, I just need you to get me in Dennis' house alone
 so I can get something back from him.
 What? None of your business.
 Is it a sex tape?
 No. Yes. How do you know that? Yeah, because he videotapes every chick he bangs. He's got like a thousand of them. I don't like 'em though. It's mostly that horrible angle that you see in porns, you know, where it's all balls and male ass just That is disgusting. Who likes that? Who finds that sexy?
 That is disgusting.
 I don't know anybody
 Are there balls and asshole men
 Okay, please stop. Please stop doing that. Friend one, best friend two, come in. Over. I'm gonna take this, and then, maybe a little bit later we could do some hand stuff.
 Are you in junior high?
 Mouth stuff?
 Oh, my God.
 Mouth stuff.
 I'll talk to you in a minute.
 Best friend one to best friend two. Okay, what's the status there, best friend two? You make contact with the target? Yeah, affirmative. I totally kicked his ass. Good man! Hey, what was this jerk's name? His name Don. Don. Typical. Did you get a last name on this chump? Yeah, Johnson. Yeah, sounds like a real sucker. Actually, no. He had some pretty sweet moves, but I totally round housed him. Took him out. My form is pretty perfect, so. Sure you did. I'm sure you did. All right, that's my man. That's my best friend right there. Hey, why don't you head back to the nest for some pizza and beer, best friend one, over and out. He forgot to say "over and out." I can't believe that. He's lying. He's spinning you a web of lies, Charlie. What are you talking about, dude? "Don Johnson." You don't find that a little suspicious? No. Should I? Don Johnson's the dude from Miami Vice,Charlie. I'm sure there's plenty of Don Johnsons running around Philly, dude. I don't think so. then maybe he beat up the, Don Johnson you're talking about. No, no. It's something else. Something stinks here, bro, and it is not just Mac's dirty socks.
 They do stink, don't they?
 They smell really bad. Really bad. I'm surprised you've been able to be in here for this long without
 cracking a window or something.
 It has not been easy.
 I should crack a window.
 You really should. I tried. It's like they're sealed shut or something. I hate to say this, bro, but I think Mac's banging the waitress. What are you talking about? Now, I can't say for sure. I don't have any hard evidence, but that's just what it feels like from where I'm standing, man and he's gonna break your heart, man. And when he breaks your heart, I'll be here to pick up the pieces and put you back together 'cause that's what a real best friend does. You know where to find me. Over and out. Oh, my God. Jesus Christ, dude. You scared the shit outta me. It's a little late, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. What are, what are you still doing up? Oh, well, you know I was just waiting for my my best friend. Right. Well I went on a long walk, so Hey, here's an idea for you. How 'bout you take your mind off of it with some pizza? And some beer. That's right. I hate all the pizza. And I had to drink all the beer. You must be wasted, dude. Yeah, and I'm very wasted. Right. Okay. Why don't you come to bed, bro. Ohh, I don't think I'll be sleeping inyourbed tonight. Doesn't really feel right. I feel like it might be a little bit better for me if I spent the night on the couch. Okay. That's cool. Just make sure you go to the bathroom, okay, before you fall asleep 'cause I don't want you to piss on the couch again. Oh, well, we, we wouldn't want that now, would we? No! We wouldn't. 'Cause that would be a terrible thing to do to your best friend. Seriously, bro, if you piss on the couch again, you're gonna buy us a I'm not gonna piss on the couch, not gonna happen. I just wanta be very clear: you're buying us a new couch.
 I'm in control of myself.
 Don't piss on the couch. You've done it before. All right, good night. Hang in, Joe. Myself. Didn't sound like best friend talk out here to me. It really wasn't. You want to come in my room? I guess I was just fine. Come on, Charlie.
 Come to your real best friend.
 Yeah.
 You're my friend.
 I'm your friend.
 Oh, God, your breath is horrible.
 Sorry. I'm like so drunk.
 Oh, Jesus.
 Just get in the bed. Oh, my God. Dennis, wake up.
 What's happening?
 It's really late, dude. There's a certain situation developing between myself, Charlie and the waitress that I need to talk to you about. Proceed. Okay, well, as you know, Charlie thinks that he and I are best friends, which is total bullshit because you know that what we have is much stronger than that.
 You and I are blood brothers.
 Oh, most definitely. Okay, so,asmy blood brother, I need to confide a secret to you. You've been banging the waitress?
 How'd you know that?
 You're my blood brother, man. I know more about you than you know about yourself. All right, listen, bro. I need you to do me a favor. Can you get Charlie out of the apartment tomorrow? Why? 'Cause she wants to bang in your bed. I don't know. She's obsessed with you or something. She's a total freak. But I don't really give a shit either way because I just want to rub it in Charlie's face for smashing my Project Bad ass tape. Whatever it's gonna take to finally get you two banging. Yeah, hey, Dennis, I got you something. You got me something? What?
 I got you a walkie-talkie.
 Dude
 That's great.
 That way we can communicate better. We'll just use a different channel than Charlie and I use.
 That's awesome, man.
 Yeah, it's great, right? Actually, yeah. Let me talk to you. Well. What is this? What am I seeing? Nothing, man. You're having a dream right now. Yeah. Just a dream.
 I'm dreaming?
 Yeah.
 You're dreaming.
 Yeah. You sure? 'Cause I feel like I'm awake. No, man. You're this is a dream that you're having. All right. Am I peeing? Are you peeing?
 It's all over the bed.
 It's piss. He's peeing. I told him he was gonna do it, I knew he was gonna do it.
 He drank too much.
 Goddamn it. Hey, guys, if I'm peeing You're wake me up. Yeah, bro, but that had to change your mind about who your real best friend is, though, huh? I'll give you this much, dude: the guy's acting very weird, okay? But I need proof if I'm gonna sell him down the river. Proof? He told me he was gonna bang her, man. Maybe the two of you are plotting against me. Look, it doesn't matter. I got a plan to prove it to you anyway.
 All right, what's this plan of yours?
 Walk with me a second. So, what I did is I planted that walkie-talkie that Mac gave me in my bedroom. We're gonna switch your walkie to that channel and we're gonna listen to the whole thing. We're gonna catch that son of a bitch red-handed. Oh, my God, that'll work. Yeah, it's gonna work, and the whole thing's gonna be on tape, too. So you know that video camera I keep in my bedroom?
 No.
 I got that bad boy running 24/7. It's like a security cam except it's for banging.
 Weird.
 Come into the office with me. Yeah, he keeps that camera on nonstop, just in case. Yeah! Here we go. "W" through "Z." You should be under "W," yeah? No, my name doesn't start with a "W." "Waitress." Here we go. "Waitress." One star. Not good. Oh, just give that to me. One star. Okay, well, I guess a deal's a deal, so pop those
 knickers off so we can jam, yeah?
 Not just yet.
 I need one more thing from you.
 Jesus Christ. I just want to bang at this point, just to get over with. Oh, I just want to get it over with, too, but I want you to bang me at Charlie and Frank's apartment. You want to bang in Charlie and Frank's apartment? Yes. Yeah, that'll be good. Yeah, we can rub his face in it. Okay, if we're gonna do that, we got to be very careful, 'cause I don't want to get caught slipping in and out before the coitus. Let's make a plan. Goddamn it, this doesn't make any sense, we should be hearing them by now. We aren't we hearing them? 'Cause I turned it off. What do you mean, you turned it off? I don't want to listen to this, man!
 you got to listen to it.
 I don't think I can. You need to hear him sexing her, okay? Because the video alone won't be evidence enough because of the angle. What's wrong with the angle? Let's put it this way, you won't be able to see anybody's
 face, you know what I'm saying?
 Oh, it's the low down
 You got it.
 I know. If we're gonna do this, the only way it's gonna work is if you're dressed like a man.
 Dressed like a man?
 You want me to dress like a man? Yeah. The only way it's really gonna work for me is if you're dressed like Dennis or Charlie. I should probably dress like Charlie, 'cause he's kind of my height. No. No, I'm gonna be Charlie, you're gonna be Dennis. That's gonna be much better for me, trust me. We'll dress you up in his clothes, and, then, that way we can slip you in and out with ease. 'Cause we got to be very careful, this could be a very very messy situation. 'Kay, so I want you to stay behind me. Get behind me and stay behind me, the whole time. I think I want to be in front of you. No, no. You got to be behind me. I got to have you behind me.
 What the hell is that all about, man?
 I don't know. Now, from here on out, I'm gonna refer to you only as Dennis. When we slip in, you're gonna start banging me, hard!
 Okay.
 Good. Well Mac's gay. Blood Brother One to Blood Brother Two. Are you there, Blood Brother Two? Yeah, this is Blood Brother Two go ahead. My mission's extremely close to being complete. But I need a favor. I need you to get Frank and Charlie away from their apartment, okay? I need to get in there without being detected. Blood Brother One, over and out! Now he says "over and out." I can't believe he just said "over and out." What do you think he wants over at your apartment? I don't know what's going on with him, man. Oh, shit, dude, I know what it is. this is sick, but hear me out. I think he wants to be you getting banged by me in your apartment. It's like role-play! Oh, God, he's got some sick, twisted obsession with us, man, and, like He's totally obsessed with us. That's why he's showing us all those videos and trying to prove to us that he's a badass. He wants to impress us because he's in love with us. Oh, my God, he's soin love with us. Oh, my God. dude!
 This is twisted.
 This is dark. We definitely need to get to about this. Look, let's just find a hiding spot, okay? Okay, good. I'm thinking if I get in the bed and I get real low and flat, and maybe you're underneath me or on top of me, you know, they won't see us. Well, how does that work? Okay, well, see, here's the problem. If I get all balled up and small, I get too high, and you'll see that there's someone in the bed. Now, the further and wider I go, the flatter I become, like a starfish, you know? What in the hell are you talking about? Why would we want to look like a starfish? It's just the best hiding spot. There aren't a lot of good hiding spots here, man. Yeah, we need to find another one, 'cause we're not hiding in the bed. These things are covered in piss. All right, come on.
 Come on! Stay behind me.
 Why are these jeans so tight? Because Dennis takes them all in at the thighs to accentuate his female form. I would never say it to his face, but Dennis has great thighs. All right, now, let's stop talking and start banging.
 We busted you!
 Caught!
 You are busted!
 we're busted? Because you look pretty busted. no, this is the best way to hide in my apartment. Goddamn it, Charlie, I knew we shouldn't have done this in the bed! Why did you have to get on top of me?! that's the only way to hide and have it not be noticeable in my apartment! There's nowhere to hide in here!
 What are you doing?
 What are you doing?
 What are you doing?
 What are you doing? Coming in here, talking about how in love with my thighs you are. Yeah, or is it my creamy thighs you're after? I see you've taken to wearing my clothes, you sick freak. Come on, you heard him talking about my thighs when he came in. It was my thighs, dude, it's always been my thighs.
 Were you guys humping?
 No! Oh, my God, where is the tape? What? The sex tape that Frank made, where is it? Frank made a sex tape, too? Yes, apparently, he made a tape of us having sex when I banged him to get back at Dennis. Oh, no, that's gone. Yeah, all right, here's what happened, guys. I thought it was one of Mac's Project Badasstapes, so I pop it in the VCR to watch it, I see what it is, I become violently ill, okay? Then I start smashing. And I smash good. So that's what you were smashing. Oh, my God, bro, I thought you were smashing my Project Bad ass tape because you hated it. What, dude? I love Project Bad ass. I watch those tapes all the time. Okay, so the sex tape is gone, then? Yeah. I smashed the crap out of it. Gone. Great. Good. Thank you, Charlie. Thanks.
 You're welcome.
 Kind of don't know what else to say. Say, I will have dinner with you and thank you for this, and thank you.
 That doesn't make any sense.
 Just say the words No, I will never go out with you. Oh, my God! I will say them for you. You should be more grateful! I'm sorry. I was gonna bang the witch just to get back at you, because I thought you smashed my tape, and I'm glad I didn't now, right? 'Cause that chick is the worst.
 man, she's terrible, gross.
 Only got one star from me.
 I saw that.
 You're watching my tapes again?
 Yeah.
 What'd you think? You got weird balls. You should see Frank's balls. They're like planets. You know what this all makes me realize, though? Is that maybe the three of us were meant to be best friends together. Yeah, that would 'cause a lot less problems if we just called it even, said we're all best buds and no more turning on each other. You can have more than one best friend, right?
 Absolutely.
 Absolutely. Three best friends. Yeah, the Three Amigos, huh? All right! The three
 Musketeers!
 Blind mice!
 The three
 Stooges. I don't want to be associated with those
 I wanna get one.
 There's another one out there.
 Move past it.
 I can't get it. All right. Let's move past it, let's put it behind us, guys. Let's put it behind us, and let's concentrate on what's really important. Hello, and welcome to Project Badassvolume XVI. As you can see, the mattresses are stacked three high, creating a safe but still amazingly badass landing zone. I will now light the fuse that is attached to the pyrotechnics all over my jacket and pants. Here goes. One, two, three bad ass. Hey, man, do you still get the feeling he wants to bang us?
 Oh, yeah. Yeah, definitely.
 That's what this is all about, huh? I think so, I think so. Yeah, yeah, yeah.                     Okay, so, just to clarify for the parole board once again, you are claiming that your father threatened to, quote, "eat the living shit out of you". That is correct. And Mr. Kelly, in your sworn statement to police, you claim that the prisoner told you that if you didn't, and I quote, "jam a bunch of stuff into your butt," he was going to "rape you so hard the room would stink." Then, he was going to, quote, "eat your butt and his son's butt in the stink until his stomach was full of your butts."
 Is this correct?
 That is also correct. Oh, man, I'm sorry. Warden, they're lying. I do not want to hurt them. In fact, I want to get as far away from those two as I possibly can. Objection! That's an objection, Your Honor. Hey, he's lying to you! Move to strike! Move to strike! Quiet! Sit down. Sit down! He's lying! He is lying! Sit down Get your hands off the microphone. Just leave it in the middle of the two of you. Leave it alone. He said the middle, put it in the middle. Take your hands off the mic!
 Leave it alone.
 That's not the middle. Leave it there. Yes. A few weeks ago, they came to apologize for getting me arrested. I did not accept their apology. That never happened! We were friends Shut up! Charlie, shut up! Quiet! Quiet! Quiet at the hearing! Oh, yeah, Dad? Not going to accept our apology? Okay, fine. Plan B, bitch! We're going to bury you. Yeah, Mr. Mac, I'm going to tell those parole board dickheads that you said you were going to rape my butt until the room stinks, and then you're going to eat my butt until your stomach is full of butt. Full of my butt, and full of Mac's butt. You're not going to say it exactly like that I'm going to say something like that, yeah. Sure? That's a lot of butts. Yeah, I think all the butt madness is really going to sell it. It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia corrections : Sososeries Charlie, I'm telling you, running away is not the answer. Mac, we're going to need supplies on the road, okay. So just calm down, help me throw some stuff into the stinking bindle. Dude, no matter where we go, my dad will find us, and while I admit it would be awesome to be hobos, drifting from town to town, solving mysteries, I think we need to find a real solution. Oh, my God, how do hobos fit all this stuff into a bandana?! It doesn't make sense, man. We're going to need, like, a towel or a tablecloth or something, but It's not going to look cool. We're going to look like assholes Wait a second. That's it! I got it! I got it! Forget the bindle. The only way that my dad is not going to kill us, is if he thinks we're already dead. Oh, great. I was hoping you'd say that. Great, let's kill ourselves. Let's do it. No. No, you didn't let me finish. I don't It's no problem, dude. I'm totally on board. Okay, I'm going to grab a knife, I'm going to jab it into your neck, I'll yank it out. Then your blood's going to start going everywhere. No, buddy, listen. And you'll die in five to ten minutes, and then depending on how horrific that looks, I'll probably do it myself, too. Okay, listen, I was going to say we fake our own death, and then he thinks we're dead, and he leaves us alone. Yeah, right. Either way works, dude. Let's just pick one before he gets here. Let's pick the second one where we don't actually die. Calm down! We'll pick the second one. All right now, let's think. We got to do it in some way that's convincing, all right. If we were going to kill ourselves, it'd be awesome, right ? Yeah, yeah. If we were going to kill ourselves, it would be with class, right, I mean, because we're worth it. Of course it would be with class! What do you think, I'm not going to die with class? Maybe some type of explosion? Of course there's going to be an explosion. You think I'm not going to explode? I'm thinking, Charlie, it would be some kind of blaze of glory for you, yes Of course it's going to be a blaze of glory. I'm going down right now. No, no, no, okay, hold on a second, okay, all right, so Did I miss something? You're not getting this. I'll walk you through the steps as we go. First step: do not douse yourself with lighter fluid.
 What is that?
 I don't know. Do you think it's for watching somebody poop? You think there's some perv coming in here to watch me make? What the hell are you guys doing in here? I got to go to the bathroom. There's a hole in the wall. We're just trying to figure out what it is. Well, well, well, Deandra. Would you look at that. Frank, Dee, what you two have discovered today is what is most commonly referred to as a glory hole. A glory hole? A secret portal created as a passage way for one to safely insert one's penis. I'm sorry, a hole to stick your dick in? The partition acts as a physical barrier, thus ensuring anonymity throughout the spontaneous act of copulation, or fellatio, or at the very least, a hand job. What? Why? Why would you want to have sex with someone you can't see? Well, Dee, I think the real question is, why wouldn't you want to have sex with someone you can't see? It's very European. Europe leads the way in sexual exploration, and quite frankly, I think it's time we caught up. This sounds hot. I'm going to go get some duct tape. Now, hold on a second there, Frank. Before you go sticking anything through that hole, you might want to consider that on the other side of this wall, more often than not, there's a dude. But you can't see through the wall, so how do you know it's not a girl? I mean, I could just picture a girl, and then, it's good. Right, well, some might find that method effective, but it's a dangerous game you're playing, Frank. Supposing the other guy is picturing a girl, also. How's he going to do that with a dick in his mouth? I don't know. That's his problem. We're filling it in. Okay, buddy, you ready? Are you sure we have to do this? Charlie, yes, we have to do this. Look, if the cops are going to identify the bodies, we need to leave dental records behind, right? So we leave a couple of teeth, bing, bam, boom. I know. I feel like it's going to hurt. Yeah, it's going to hurt like a bitch. Okay, ready? One, two Wait. That just kind of came out on its own. Yeah, that slipped right out, huh? I barely pulled that. I barely pulled it. What? Damn, dude! That's another Man, you should really brush your teeth more because that is not normal. Oh, Charlie, stop pulling your teeth out like that, man. It's freaking me out. They're just coming right out. They, like, slip right out. It's really freaking me out! Oh, shit.
 You think it's my dad?
 Of course it's your dad. Charlie, open up. We got a dick hole in the bar. I need you to come fill it in. Okay, I got to go fill her a dick hole, bro. No, no, no, bro, come on. We don't have time. Okay, uh, audible. Grab the camera. Is Dee's car outside? Uh yes. Okay, great. We'll steal it. We'll use it as a part of blaze of glory. Charlie, now you got to stop. You really got to stop. Just give it to me. Give me all the teeth. Okay, I got them in my pocket. Huh? Hey! What the Okay, go, go, go! Why would you do that? Come on! Open the door! Huh? I don't know. It's all happening so fast, man! You could've just opened it. Oh, that's true. I'll fire you through that window. All right, grab the Just go! Just go! Go, go, go! The videotape is done. My teeth are scattered throughout the car, and the will is in place. Great. Toss it out the window. They'll think we did it at the last minute. Okay, got it. Okay. What's next? All right, I'm going to gun this car as fast as it goes directly into that wall. Now, judging by the distance, I'm thinking I could get it up to about 60, 70 miles an hour. Oh, definitely, definitely. At the last possible second, I'm thinking maybe three feet from the wall We jump out to safety, the car explodes in a hot ball of fury and we're dead to the world. Okey dokey. Good luck with that. Wait. Where you going, dude? Well, I'm gonna I'm gonna watch you do it. No, we need to do it together.
 But I'm not really doing anything.
 Yes, you are, Charlie. You're here for moral support. But if no one's actually seeing us jump out of the car Well, it's we're gonna kill ourselves together. There's no real Get out, get out, get out. I'll do it myself. The whole thing's gonna be better without me anyway, Mac. I'm telling you, it's gonna be great without me. All right, buddy, good luck! Pussy. Holy shit, dude, are you all right? Why didn't you jump out?
 I'm okay, I'm okay, Charlie.
 Holly shit! Dude, oh, my God! I guess I was just going too fast. I was going too fast. Oh, my God. All right, let's get out of here. We're gonna have to burn the car. Let's do it. We'll have to get some gasoline. Holy shit! We're not gonna find something to burn the car at a pawnshop. Are you kidding me? You can find amazing things in pawnshops. This is the perfect Should've gone to a gas station, dude, and buy some gasoline to burn the car. I know, but we've been talking about this the whole walk over. You can't go to a gas station. There's too many cameras. Bro, like, I say something, and then you, like, forget it two seconds later, okay? Are you sure you're all right? Your ear's bleeding a ton. I'm fine. I feel like $1 million. All right, well, you don't seem like Well, then, focus, Mr. Million Dollars, and let's find something to blow up a car. Oh, Charlie! Look at that wedding dress, dude. That's sad. Okay, that is not gonna blow a car up, okay? So, can you focus? Will you please find a way to focus? Oh, shit, look at this, dude! Now we're talking. Damn, they sell guns here? They sell everything here. That's what I'm trying to tell you. Pawnshops are like international waters. People come in, and they just trade stuff, you know what I mean ? Anything goes here. We can get whatever we want, all right? Let's pick this bad boy up. Shit, that's awesome. All right, good. So you're sure we'll have enough money for this and the wedding dress, right ? 'Cause that is a great gun. We're not buying the wedding dress. Yeah, we're buying the wedding dress. Are you crazy? We can't just leave it here. We absolutely can leave it here. It's not gonna help us in any way, shape or form. That's crazy. Bro, okay, you know what? That car wreck, it scrambled your circuits, all right? You're losing your mind. So, will you just let me handle it? I got Dee's purse. We got her credit cards in here. We have plenty of money. I know what I'm doing. And stop talking about the wedding dress. All right. Sir, excuse me, sir. Hi, we are in desperate need of something that will destroy a car and, uh, annihilate any traces of a human being. Let me see what I got. All right, you see that? Your old buddy here knows what he's doing every now and then.
 Yeah ?
 Yeah. Well, this is an interesting turn. I'm assuming this is a live grenade, yes? Oh, yeah. Well, then, we'll take it. Was the wedding in Philadelphia? I don't know. I don't care about the wedding. Sir, do you have anything that might get my buddy's head straight? He's losing his mind. Got some poppers in the back. All right. There we go. All right, Luther, today's the day. You got any plans for the outside? Yeah, I got some plans. I got some big plans. I'm gonna throw this grenade into the car. The car will explode, and our problems will be solved. In the meantime, I need you to do a popper. Okay, I understand the plan. Except for when we find the bride. Don't even start, man.
 That's a very important part
 You've been talking crazy
 of my plan.
 for way too long, so just take a deep breath of this. Inhale. There we go. Grenade. Gonna throw it in the car.
 Yeah, let's do it.
 You and me? I'm back. Let's not talk about the dress anymore. Okay, here we go. No dress, grenade. Go, move! Go, go, go, go! This is gonna be awesome, dude. It's gonna be huge. That's it? Weird.
 That was totally lame.
 That's what grenades do?
 It was a very old grenade.
 What a gyp. I thought it was gonna be so much more awesome than that. The car's not even on fire. All right, plan B. Gun, gas tank. I'm gonna fire directly into it.
 The car's gonna go up.
 Now you're thinking.
 Yeah?
 Go, baby. Ready? You're gonna waste all the bullets. You got to get a lot closer. Closer? No, you got to stay far away cause it's gonna blow up, dude. Chickenshit, I'll walk right up to that thing and shoot. No, you can't walk right up to it and shoot. It'll blow you to safety. All right, how about this? Popper put it to my nose.
 We'll walk up, and I'll just be
 That will help you focus. Okay, well, let's just That's at least the smart thing to do. Okay, hold on, I'm stepping on this dress. One, two Go.
 Ah, God damn it, dude!
 No more bullets. Grenades and bullets don't burn cars? All right, dude, new plan. The teeth, the envelope, the crash. I think it's enough, you know? You think that's enough? Maybe the cops will think we just, like, I don't know disintegrated? All right, fine. Then, we'll get these credit cards, we'll buy some camping equipment. We'll go up to the roof, and we'll lay low. See, there's my boy. He's making plans again.
 He's thinking.
 He's back! He's also wearing a wedding dress, though, and I'd like him to take it off. Oh, yeah, this is outrageous. That's completely crazy, man. This is it. Uh, I'm starting to have second thoughts about this sex party thing, Frank. Dennis, what, are you having second thoughts about the glory hole? And now you're gonna be skittish about the sex party? Don't You said you wanted to have anonymous sex. This is the place. I do want to have anonymous sex. I want to have anonymous sex. I want to have a sex party. I want it all. I want the glory hole. I want all those things. Here it is. What I'm having a hard time believing, though, Frank, is that there is an elite secret sex society behind that door, in this building. I used to run with this crew. These people are the most powerful, influential, sexiest people in Philadelphia. Well, then, why are they having a goddamn orgy in such a dump then? I thought this kind of thing went down in, like, somebody's elegant mansion. I was looking forward to that. No, nobody's gonna have an orgy in their mansion. All over their nice furniture? I mean, that doesn't make sense. Well, no, it doesn't. That's a really good point. All right, let's do it. Yeah, all right, put your mask on, and don't embarrass me. All right. Don't embarrass yourself. What is the password? Orgy You may enter. Orgy? Seriously? What the hell is this place? What did you bring me to? This is a buffet. Well, I can see that it's a buffet, but why is there a buffet at a goddamn orgy, Frank? You don't want to bang on an empty stomach, do you? I don't want to bang any of these people anyway. They're all paunchy and weird and old. You can't tell under the masks. I can absolutely tell. And why are our costumes so much more elaborate than everybody else's like they didn't put any effort into it? Ah, Jesus Christ, that guy's not even wearing a mask. He's got the right idea. This beak is interfering with my nosh. What are you doing? Don't take it off. Ah, Jesus, what are we doing here, man? How is this even an orgy? Nobody's having sex. What did you bring me to? You brought me what is this, like It's like a half nude buffet party. Oh, it's not exactly what I thought it was gonna be, either, but it's okay. There's a lot of food. Frank, I think we can both agree this is not the kind of anonymous sex that we're looking for, right? You want to go down by the bridge? What in God's name could possibly be down by the bridge? I don't know. It could be cool. It could be cool? No, Frank, I don't want to go down by the bridge. You know what, I'm going back to the bar. I'm gonna go back to the glory hole. That's something that I feel like I could wrap my head around. This is ridiculous. You think these are fresh shrimp or frozen shrimp? I don't care! What is this place? These are not Who are these people? It's like a bad acid trip in here. I'm coming. I'm gonna come. Now, what if I just slip my foot over like this, as if to say, "Hello, I'd like to have some anonymous sex please." All right, I'm into that. Then, I wait for the signal back. If it's a lady's foot, I'm in the clear! But, Frank, here's my problem with that. A man can wear a woman's shoe. You can't rule out trickery. I mean that's why we need the viewing slot. The slot defeats the purpose. I could see your eyes. We might as well get married! It's the safest way, Frank. Dennis, if I was looking for safe, I wouldn't be sticking my dick through a wall. You guys, get out here right now. You need to take a look at this. Good news, Dee, we made the bathroom unisex. Glory hole's up and running, baby. I don't care about that. According to the Philadelphia Police Department, Mac and Charlie are dead. You got the camera, man?
 Yeah, is it ready?
 Yeah I think so. We good, are we on? Dennis and Frank, if you're watching this, then we're already dead. Our lives were horrible. Horrible and sad, so we decided to end it all. Not me actually, my life was pretty sweet. But Charlie and I had a suicide pact, and I have to honor that because I am honorable man. I will die an honorable man. There's also a will enclosed and you totally have to do all of that because that's like a law. Okay, wait a second. My life was also very honorable. Here we go! I can't believe they're dead. I can't believe they didn't include me in their suicide pact. What? Are you crazy? They're not dead, they're definitely doing something stupid,
 but they're not dead.
 You saw the tape, Dee! My best friends went on a blaze of glory and they didn't even ask me to be part of it. This is terrible! Are you buying this? That is ridiculous, Dennis, they left us a list of demands. What are you talking about? That's their last will and testament. That is not demands. It says at the top : "List of demands." Well, whatever, it's their wishes and we have to honor them. Oh, we do? Oh we do, we have to honor them? Okay, let's see, Frank. Charlie's number one : my ashes are to be made into a tea and to be dranken by everyone in bar. Done! Damn it, gross, fine, what else? Mac's number one. In lieu of a body, which was most likely blown up in the most awesome way imaginable, I would like the duster to be burned and its ashes buried in an unmarked grave somewhere by the river. Well, that's crazy. I'm not gonna burn or bury the duster. Yeah, we also both have to name our first born child Murphy because that was Robocop's name. Goddamn it! Mac is dead and he's still bossing me around. Mac is not dead, Dennis. How could you be so cold? They blew up my car! Not burning the duster.
 You're still talking about a coat?
 Absolutely! That is an automobile.
 It's a piece of clothing!
 They're people!
 They're all lying!
 They're lying people! Jesus, man, they must be really broken up. We can hear 'em from up here. They're like crying and whing and I'm excited about the hot dogs.
 Oh, crap!
 What? We should've got beans, dude. Hobos are always eating beans. Damn. We'll be fine without the beans, all right, cause this is a perfect, perfect hiding spot. This would be better with beans though. Leave it alone with the beans. No! Stop it! Don't do it. Oh, my God. How? How is that possible? I don't know. Just put it down. You think they're my baby teeth? Put it with the other ones. You're not gonna be able to eat this hot dog. I'll suck it down. I asked you to leave me be. I asked you to let me live my life. But you wouldn't go away. You kept pushing, and pushing, until you forced me to do something drastic Something I was hoping I would never have to do Well, I guess this is probably, this is probably gonna be it so we should, we should get started. What to say about Mac. He certainly was angry.
 Burn the duster!
 I'm not burning the duster! Okay, I'm not burning the duster. All right, that's crazy. That's like, that's insane. Why would I ever burn, I mean, come on. I will continue to wear it, in his honor. And I will burn some other things. You know maybe like these, stupid goddamn sleeveless t-shirts that he wants retired and hung up in the bar. I'll burn these. But I am not burning the duster, okay? So forget it. It probably won't even burn anyway. It's not supposed to it's flame-retardant. That's like the whole point. It's like a shield of armor, so stop asking me to burn the duster. I'm not gonna burn it! So, end of story, you know. Let's just move on. So Yeah, all right. Well, uh, thank you. Come on. No.
 I'm not doing it.
 Come on. Deandra, get on that stage. Before, uh, Mac and Charlie died they made a slideshow. And, uh, we're going to play a song that was a favorite of theirs. Go ahead. It's all the same Only the names have changed Every day, it seems we're wasting away Another place, where the faces are so cold I'd drive all night, just to get back home I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride I'm wanted, dead or alive I miss you, Charlie. This is bullshit, dude. No one's mourning me properly. What are you talking about, man? Your mom's sitting right there. She's mourning you. Yeah, she watched an entire episode of Mama's Familyand fell asleep. And now, I'm going to give them the one gun salute. No, you're not! All right. Oh, my God! Let go! Wow, that was great and very touching. Thanks so much for coming, both of you. Time to go. See you at the next one. Bonnie, Bonnie, Bonnie, aww, it's going to be okay. I'll tell you what, why don't you go into the bathroom, go into the center stall, I got a little surprise for you. It's going to cheer you up. That's okay, Frankie. I don't need to go potty. Oh, damn it. Can you believe it, sis? They're actually gone.
 This changes everything.
 I need a ride home. No, no, no. Can't do that, sis. I got to get back home ASAP and meet a couple potential new roommates. Hot ones! You know what I'm saying? All right, hey, it's time to move on. Would you mind not breathing directly into my mouth? No thoughts on that? You're not going to say anything? You're just going to stare at me? That's what you're bringing to the table? That's great.

Um, can I help you? You're looking for a roommate, right? Uh, yeah. Yeah, I was looking for two, actually. Female. I believe I was pretty clear in the ad here. "Male, 30, looking for Three's Company type deal. Did Odd Couplething for past decade, looking for something new." Yeah, I did the Three's Company thing once. It was pretty cool for like a week, and then I banged one of them.
 Oh nice.
 Not nice. Do you know what this is like? Banging the chicks that you live with? It's terrible, man. Every day you have to deal with this. Get out, lady. Wow, yeah, I guess I never really thought about that before. You know, you're you're much smarter than my old roommate. Yeah, look, I'm going to be upfront with you. I run with a pretty wild crew. There's probably going to be chicks over here, like, all the time. I'm into some pretty crazy shit. Here's the best part: I don't even know most of their names. Oh, yes! It's like You know, I've been trying to get into the anonymous sex thing lately.
 Oh, yeah?
 Now, are you, uh, European? Oh, I'm sorry. What gave it away? Nice. Yeah, well, you know, I could probably consider, like, a, uh,Perfect Strangers type of deal. Look, I like this by the way. This is a sweet duster. First, he doesn't burn the duster, and now he's looking for new roommates? Why did you want to burn that duster anyway? Because he always wears it with no shirt and a shitload of cologne. It's totally ruined.
 Hello, bitches!
 Jesus Christ, Dee! You scared the shit out of me. I almost dropped all my beer. I knew you two weren't dead. What are you doing popping out of our tent? Not cool, Dee! Oh, not cool? Oh, I'll tell you what's not cool. Crashing my car into a building, exploding a grenade inside of it and then convincing your friends your family that you're dead. That's one of the cooler things you could ever do. That's really unbelievably cool.
 I suggest you try it
 Cooler than I thought it was. I don't know why you're up here doing whatever it is that you're doing, and I don't care. What I do care about, is my 1997 Dodge Neon. So here's the deal. You two monkeys are going to get me a new 1997 Dodge Neon, or I'm going to go and tell Frank and Dennis that you faked your own deaths and you're hiding up on the roof. Well, now you're just talking crazy. You can't buy a new 1997 Dodge Neon.
 You can buy an old one
 Okay, new to me. Dee, you got bigger problems, because my dad just got out of jail, and he's coming to kill you. What?! Me? Are you sure? Kill you, kill us, kill everybody really. He's going to kill everyone. Why would you not tell me this news earlier? Oh, my God, get off our case, Dee, all right? What's done is done. Look, Mac and I are hobo drifters now, okay? We don't dwell on the past. No, hobo drifters live in the present. So look, if you really want to get back at Frank and Dennis, you got to fake your own death. I don't want to get back at Frank and Dennis. I want to get at you two. Really is that what? What? Is that what your plan was? I tuned out during the whole tirade. She said the 1997 Dodge Neon thing and I totally lost her. All right, Dee, I'll tell you what, here's the plan. Why don't you fake your own death like us? It really is the only thing you can do now 'cause you're in this too deep. Look, you want to die? Now what's your bean situation? You got some beans on you, or what's up? Good-bye, son. Aw, man, I got to tell you, this is awesome. It's making me forget that Mac ever even died. Oh, yeah, just relax, roommate. I'm going to relax. I'm going to relax all over the place in a second. Shit. Jan? All right, I got to get this. Hey, Dennis. Really? What do you want? Hey, I just wanted to let you know I was going to go for a quick jog in Fairmont Park by myself. Oh, yeah? Great. Okay, have fun. But, it's kind of dangerous. Yeah, I got it, Dee.
 I don't know if you noticed
 Go jogging! Ang go ! What's this have to do with me? Just me out there in the middle of the night in the dark by myself. Really? Sorry about her, I She was a bag I hate her. Which one do you want first? Huh, Greta or Sasha? Oh, no. No, shit, bro. Why'd you do that, bro? Come here, man.
 What did I do?
 You said their names. Come on, man, that kills it for me. Look, bro, can I be honest with you? This is great and all, but I was really hoping for more of like a, you know, anything goes, crazy European sex party kind of a thing.
 Something a little kinkier.
 Kinky ? Oh, kinky. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I like this. You like this, we like this. Yeah, let me make some calls. Do you think you could put something like that together? Of course I can, man. I'm European. Oh! That's It looks like he's got a lot of new friends. Yes, I can see that, Charlie. Some of them are really pretty girls. Yes, they are very pretty. Wow, that's tough, man. That's a tough thing to see. Shut up, dude. I'll bet you Frank is throwing a party, too. It's your turn to take the bedpan out tonight. "Little freak! I did it last time!" No, Charlie, I got up in the middle of the night, and I walked down the hallway with the bedpan. "All right, Frank, I'll do it, only because I like you so much". I like you, too, Charlie. I like you, too, New Charlie. You know what, man? I'm kicking it up a notch.
 We're haunting these bitches.
 Haunting's cool, man.
 Coming back from the grave, bitch.
 All right, that's cool. What is this? What are you doing, like Poltergeistor something?
 Awesome, right?
 No, no. Craig T. Nelson. Craig T. Nelson is the best, dude, but Poltergeist?
 What ?
 It's not scary. It's all about psychological damage. Big deal, look at me. Psychological damage up to here. It doesn't do anything for me, you know? Physical damage, that's what's gonna irritate people. All right, what do you suggest? Well, I mean, if anything, maybe we tie some knives to our fingers and we get a little more serious about this whole murder thing.
 Haunting.
 Haunting!
 We're gonna haunt them.
 I'm sorry, I was thinking Oh, my God, I'm so happy to see you. Oh, God, I had the weirdest night. It was crazy. As soon as I left Dennis's place, I realized I don't have a car, right, so I actually do have to run home by myself through the park in the middle of the night. So I'm on Spring Garden Street, and this big car full of gangbangers Okay, gangbangers. That is an awesome story, Dee. That's the end of it, right? That could be the end of the story? Charlie and I are right in the middle of something. Check it out, we're gonna put some knives on our fingers and start murdering people.
 Haunting people.
 Haunting.

 Whatever. You're gonna do like a Poltergeistthing?
 That's Dennis.

The only rule is: don't tell me your names. I don't want to know your names, okay? "Hi, I'm Charlie. Frankie, I love these girls." Frank, what are you doing, man ? You're freaking the girls out with this mannequin. Get rid of it. Dennis, these girls are German. German. "We're gonna have demented sex, right, Frank?" That is the greatest party I've ever seen. These sons of bitches! Is he gonna take that stupid little mannequin everywhere, man?
 That is freaking me out.
 Move past the mannequin. They're just hanging out with a bunch of half naked ladies, and I just ran and sweated for absolutely nothing? Yeah, I don't sound like that, all right.
 Goddamn it. Get past it.
 Who cares about the mannequin? I care about the mannequin! I look like a jerk in front of those girls. I'm putting an end to this right now. Yeah, dude, screw your dad. Let him eat our asses. Let him eat my butt into smithereens. I'm ending this. Let's not be rash, right? I mean, come on. Look, if we're not gonna haunt them, we should have a little fun, right? Let's scare the shit out of them.
 We got to make an entrance.
 Oh, let's scare the shit out of them. Jan, this is what I want, man. You've given me what I want. Look, I have this very kinky surprise for you, my friend. I've arranged for you to use the glory hole! I forgot about the glory hole.
 I just sent someone in there now.
 Yeah ? Totally anonymous. There are no words, man. That's right, I'm the boss. But I'm a good boss, and I'm gonna allow you to watch. "Okay, Frankie!" Somebody's coming. Any minute now, the German broad is gonna knock on that wall, which is my signal to go in my pants, take out my penis and stick it through the hole. Then, she can go to town. Hey, honey, you want to take care of this monster for me or what ? There is no way I can picture that is a girl. What the hell are you doing here, man?

Surprise, bitches! We're alive, and it's blowing your minds right now. No, it is not blowing our minds at all. I knew you guys were alive. Yeah, I knew you guys were alive, okay? I figured it out right before the funeral. How? 'Cause I could hear you guys rustling around in the vents. You were speaking at full volume, okay? Did you think you were being, like, crafty? I could see you staring at me through the window. You know I can see through my windows, right?
 I wanted to piss you off.
 Well, what about me? Did you want to piss me off? You, I thought, might have actually been murdered. That's what I thought. That's what I thought, okay? Frank, you knew, too? Yeah I knew. And some of the stuff you've been doing with this mannequin here, that's like to teach me a lesson or? Did I see you bang that thing? All right, you know what, let's just But why were you guys pretending that you were dead anyway? That's a really messed up thing to do. My dad got out on parole. He's coming to kill me and Charlie. No, no, you got a letter the other day.
 He sent a letter.
 Who sent a letter? I got it, I got it. It was sent to the bar. "Dear son, I asked you to leave me be forced me to do something that I hoped I'd never have to do." Oh, yeah, here we go. "I just got out of prison, and I'm heading to Tijuana. I wanted to get as far away from you as I could, so that I could learn how to forgive you. Please do not try to contact me ever. I promise that I'm not gonna hurt you. Love, Dad. P.S. : I still love you." See, 'cause we
 This whole thing was
 We didn't have to do all the Sorry about your car, Dee.                     Well, I guess this is probably, this is probably gonna be it so we should, we should get started. What to say about Mac. He certainly was angry.
 Burn the duster!
 I'm not burning the duster! Okay, I'm not burning the duster. All right, that's crazy. That's like, that's insane. Why would I ever burn, I mean, come on. I will continue to wear it, in his honor. And I will burn some other things. You know maybe like these, stupid goddamn sleeveless t-shirts that he wants retired and hung up in the bar. I'll burn these. But I am not burning the duster, okay? So forget it. It probably won't even burn anyway. It's not supposed to it's flame-retardant. That's like the whole point. It's like a shield of armor, so stop asking me to burn the duster. I'm not gonna burn it! So, end of story, you know. Let's just move on. So Yeah, all right. Well, uh, thank you. Come on. No.

 Yeah, my ass. Get out of here. You sex freak, go! Americans are so uptight. You ruined our glory hole. Beat it and shut the door. Sick freak. You didn't know anything Weirdo. What ? Surprise, bitches! We're alive, and it's blowing your minds right now. No, it is not blowing our minds at all. I knew you guys were alive. Yeah, I knew you guys were alive, okay? I figured it out right before the funeral. How? 'Cause I could hear you guys rustling around in the vents. You were speaking at full volume, okay? Did you think you were being, like, crafty? I could see you staring at me through the window. You know I can see through my windows, right?
 I wanted to piss you off.
 Well, what about me? Did you want to piss me off? You, I thought, might have actually been murdered. That's what I thought. That's what I thought, okay? Frank, you knew, too? Yeah I knew. And some of the stuff you've been doing with this mannequin here, that's like to teach me a lesson or? Did I see you bang that thing? All right, you know what, let's just But why were you guys pretending that you were dead anyway? That's a really messed up thing to do. My dad got out on parole. He's coming to kill me and Charlie. No, no, you got a letter the other day.
 He sent a letter.
 Who sent a letter? I got it, I got it. It was sent to the bar. "Dear son, I asked you to leave me be forced me to do something that I hoped I'd never have to do." Oh, yeah, here we go. "I just got out of prison, and I'm heading to Tijuana. I wanted to get as far away from you as I could, so that I could learn how to forgive you. Please do not try to contact me ever. I promise that I'm not gonna hurt you. Love, Dad. P.S. : I still love you." See, 'cause we
 This whole thing was
 We didn't have to do all the Sorry about your car, Dee.                     Hey, you guys, what are you doing tonight? What the hell kind of question is that? Yeah, you're asking us to predict the future, Dee. How can I predict the future? Well, there's a new martini bar opening up downtown. I thought maybe we could do something different tonight. Where is this shit coming from? She just watched that stupid "Sex and the City" movie. Oh, my God, when will that show die? Never, apparently. Dee, you tried this shit 30 years ago when that show first came on the air. Nobody wants to play "Sex and the City" with you. Come on, Charlie. You know you did it.
 Fess up!
 I did not poop the bed!
 Rewind.
 What? I'm sorry. Did you say something about pooping in a bed? Yeah, there was some poop in our bed this morning. Oh, Jesus. And Charlie did it. That is bullshit! Guys, hold on a second. Relax! Walk us through what happened. Nice and slow. Well, yesterday we wake up and there's a piece of poop right in the middle of me and Frank, okay? Wait a minute, so this happened two nights in a row? So we threw the first piece of poop out 'cause big deal, whatever. Accidents happen, right? But then this morning, there's another piece of poop in the exact same spot Now, Frank says it's not him. I say it's not me, but you bet your ass it's one of us. This is a lot to handle. Now, the second poop, you held onto it, right? Brought it along. Dee, when we said we can't predict the future, how could we possibly have seen something this awesome coming? Yeah, we're going to have to clear our schedules. What?! This is going to require a lot of attention. You're not going to go out with me tonight 'cause these idiots found two poopies in a bed? But it's not the poop. It's the mystery behind the poop. It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia 4x07: "Who Pooped The Bed?" The Bitches Team Hey, girlfriend! Oh, my God, you scared me! Did I? My bad. Why did you jump out from behind a car?
 Were you stalking me?
 Girlfriend, you're crazy.
 Stop calling me "girlfriend."
 So check it: putting together a girl night out. Want you to come. Oh, my God, why would I ever go out with you? I hate you. I know. I hate you, too. That's the way girls are. We're catty. We backstab and talk about each other behind our backs and stalk. Don't you remember how Samantha and Carrie and the dykey redhead used to do that kind of fun stuff? I don't know who you're talking about. Sex and the City. You are the worst. Look, I know you're going to be alone tonight, okay? I read all about it in the notebook Charlie keeps of your whereabouts.
 You don't have any friends.
 I have a ton of friends. Name one friend. Frederick is your cat and he died three weeks ago. Look, it's all here in the notebook, so stop busting my balls and let's go meet some men. Give me that notebook. I'm not gonna give you the notebook. Don't reach for the notebook. I'll give you the notebook if you come out with me tonight.
 Fine.
 Fine! See you tonight! You want me to do what? We want you to examine our poopie. We just want to know who it came from. That's it. I mean Now, we don't presume to be scientists. That's why we brought it to you. We assume there's some kind of test you can run with some of these machine. You don't actually have to do any tests 'cause I already know it's Charlie's poop and not mine. You have a hole in the back of your pajamas. It's not my poop! You've been sleeping in a giant dress shirt. It probably just fell out the bottom of it. Okay, clearly, we need to figure this out before it tears us apart. The only way for us to get to the bottom of this is for you to tear that poop apart and tell us what's inside of it. You know, get inside there. You want me to examine a plastic container full of feces? I feel like you're going to say something else right there and then you stopped, right? Please get out of my lab. That wasn't what he was going to say. Man, why'd you have to go there? Look, it's a simple job. By the way, there's no reason to be harsh. Tiny little simple poop test! You just missed out on an extraordinary adventure, pal. Let's get out of here. There's other ways to figure this out. Pussy! You got turd? Yeah, we got a turd. I'll take a look at it. Okay, well it's definitely poop. Uh, yeah, we know that, guy. Whoever it was seems to have been eating newspaper. All right, well, now we're getting somewhere. Which one of you idiots was eating a goddamn newspaper? It's gonna go both ways, dude.
 Really?
 I'm sorry, yeah. What else? What else? This appears to be a piece of a credit card. Inconclusive. How is that not specific to one of you? I wish it was, man, but that's inconclusive. But you've got to There's a good deal of blood in this stool. Of course there is. Whoever's it is should see a doctor. Well, don't give us judgments. Just tell us what's in there. What else?
 This is wolf hair.
 Wolf air. Also inconclusive. Jesus Christ! There is so much wolf hair in our apartment right now, man. But why are you eating it? Well, you ingest everything. Both of you are eating wolf? Have you tried it before? All right, guys! This is getting us nowhere. Can we move on to the DNA test, please? That's a good idea. DNA's good. Yeah, I can't do that. What do you mean?
 Aren't you a scientist?
 Yeah, do it. No, I'm an Econ major. I just wanted to look at some poop. You're not a scientist?! I never said I was a scientist. Bro, you have wasted out time. You have ruined our turd. That's the only piece of evidence that we have. Who is she again? Oh, that's Artemis. She's the sassy one who always plays by her own rules. Guys are playing hard to get. I'm gonna take off my bra, blast my nips. Okay, let's hold on that. I think what we need to do is just talk and have fun. Bring 'em to us, you know? So Artemis, where'd you get that great top? Burmington Coat Factory. I got it on sale. It's irregular. Excuse me! Hi, can we get three Cosmos, please? Actually, make mine a water. Water? We're in a bar. Yeah, well, I have a drinking problem. That's a horribly unattractive thing to announce to everybody. I'd like a water, please. She'll take a Cosmo and she'll just hold it in her hand.
 That's fine.
 That is a terrible idea. It's a pretty good idea if you want to get that notebook back. Yeah, I'll take a Jager Bomb. No Jager Bombs. Fine, Irish Car Bomb. Sake Bomb? Nothing with "bombs" in the name, okay? Please, the Cosmos. Go get the Cosmos. Thanks a lot. Goddamn it! Hottie alert at 2:00. Here they come. Incoming. Okay, let me do the talking. What's up, ladies? Not much, just enjoying the view. Name's Artemis. I have a bleached asshole. Okay, it's time to move on to the reenactment and dramatization. Jesus Christ, Frank, you sleep in that? My legs get hot. Well, I definitely see how something could have slipped out of there. Absolutely. That would have fallen right out in the middle of the bed. What about Charlie's hole? Just get into the bed, please, and show us how you sleep, guys. Well, right off the bat, I think there's a clear solution could have prevented this entire thing. You guys need to get two beds. Oh, maybe I'll get two TVs and two refrigerators. What are you talking about? Do we come to your house and tell you how to sleep? I sleep in a king-sized bed by myself. When I have to go to the bathroom, I use a toilet. Look at He Dennis on his bed made for kings with his toilet made out of gold. Okay, guys, everybody calm down, please. This is not about lifestyle. This is not about judgments. This is about truth, okay? Now, Charlie and Frank, show us how you were positioned the night of the incident. Excuse me. Incidents. All right, well, I'm pretty sure I was sleeping like this that night. It's just, like, no way it could have been me. Charlie, we sleep ass to ass, you know that. Oh, great. Okay, clearly, we're having a problem with honesty here. Dennis, a word. I hate to say it, bro, but I think we're gonna have to do an overnight observation. Yeah, well, to be honest with you, I wouldn't mind seeing how this whole situation really works. Fascinating. Well, this just gets weirder and weirder, man. Anything? Nothing. False alarm. Damn it, dude, we can't keep doing this all night. Oh, I know. You know what. Why don't we sleep in shifts? Yeah, I mean, I'm not saying this isn't important work
 but I can't keep my eyes open.
 No, I hear you. I hear you. I hear you. All right, I'll tell you what. You go ahead and go first. I still got a little energy left. I don't know about this floor, Dennis. It's covered in sand or something. No. It smells like some kind of spice blend or pesticide, or some other kind of sandy poison or something. I don't know. I wouldn't sleep on the floor, though.
 You got to sleep with them?
 You got to, you got to. You sure you're all right?
 Yeah, I'm fine. I got it.
 You sure? Okay, I'm just gonna sleep for, like, 15 minutes, right? And then you wake me up, and then we'll switch it off.
 You good?
 I'm fine. My God. My God! If we're going to be meeting sophisticated men, we need to start acting with class. We cannot be telling people that we have bleached assholes. He was gonna find out anyway. Oh, my God. And you, you shouldn't be drinking in a shoe store. You shouldn't be drinking in a shoe store. What is the matter with you? I told you to pace yourself. I have a drinking problem. Well, then, you should know how to hold your booze a little better. I'll hold your boobs a little better. Oh, good one. Ladies, can I help you? Hello. We are here for the Manolos.
 And what's your shoe size?
 13. We don't carry shoes that large. Perhaps you'd like to try the Big and Tall store down the street? You know what? I don't like this bitch's attitude. Did she just try and break a bottle over my head? No, of course she didn't. Girls, I'll meet you outside. Get her. Okay. Just the littlest bit snug, aren't they? There we go. Cute, though, huh? How much?
 700.
 700? Yes, well, I'll tell you what. You pay for quality 'cause there's so much crap out there these days. Man, I am excited to bust my dogs out in these tonight. We're going to a French restaurant Le Bistro. It's five stars, so I don't know if you've been to it. That sounds great, but this has been declined. Declined? You're kidding me! Oh! Makes me so mad. Like, the credit card companies the way they waste your time. Probably protecting me. I spent a lot of money today. Try that one. Excuse me. Oh, God. Did it not go through? What motive could a man possibly have for pooping where he sleeps?
 I love that bed.
 Don't buy this act. Frank, I will jam that poop right back up your ass where it came from. You know in that bed Guys, guys, guys, clearly, we're exhausted and full of emotion, but we should not be threatening each other with jamming feces into each other's assholes, okay? Wait a minute. Wait, wait. Hold on a second. What if we had them produce another sample, and we cross-reference the samples? They'd have to do it in front of us so that there's no foul play. I can't go now. Really? I could probably squeeze something out. I'll get some newspaper. This is exciting. This is very exciting. Why, of all places, are we here? Because it's your bar, and we're gonna drink for free. Well, damn it, waitress, that is not what I wanted. How? How do you still not know what my name is?! Oh, I'm sorry. I'm supposed to be expected to rember everyone's name at all moments of the day. This is the opposite of where we're supposed to be. Oh, Dee, we were just on the verge of a major breakthrough. He was turtle-heading. Turtle-heading! No, there was no turtles anywhere. Were you just pooping on the floor? No, I was not. That was an endurance contest, which I won, by the way
 You're paying for that.
 She doesn't have to pay for that.
 Yes, she does.
 Bite me, asshole. You have a bad attitude when you're drinking. You have a bad attitude when you're drinking, you huge-footed slut. You know what? I'm just gonna go get more wasted, and then I'm gonna bang some rim, dude. Really? Could it be this guy? No, it can't, but it could be Dennis. Pass. Whatever. You know what? I'm gonna take this. I'm gonna take this, and I'll see you assholes later.
 That is my notebook.
 Free coffee for a year. Wait a second. Where did she get my note?
 You know what? I have backups.
 What is with her? Something about drinking. She just won't stop talking about it.
 What, the plates of shit?
 Somebody pooped the bed. Whatever. Let's get out of here. We could use a fresh set of eyes on this if you don't mind. No, thank you. I think that Artemis and I have much better things to do, thank you. Actually, I'm just gonna stick around. Excuse me?
 You know.
 Are you kidding me? You know what? Forget it, okay? I'm gonna do this by myself. I'm gonna go find some classy, sophisticated people who can hold their booze, who don't talk about their bleached assholes, and who aren't obsessed with poop. Okay, bring me up to speed here, boys. This is an interesting piece. I love his use of space. The space that's what I loved about it. What do you think the chunky earth tones represent? Look at the rich texture, the dimensions. It's almost as if you can smell it. Oh, God This is the piece I was telling you about. It's unbelievable and so raw, so base, so utterly human. It's almost as if it exploded out of the artist. Well I think it's crap. Crap Crap Crap Crap You know what? Guys, let's just wrap up the evidence and start again fresh tomorrow. You think they'll keep, or should we put them in the fridge? They'll keep fine. You know what? You guys win, all right? Are you happy? Win what? Heart failure! Check the circuit breaker. Nobody move! Everyone here's a suspect. Put on another pot of coffee. It's gonna be a long night. Four turds, five suspects, so many, many nameless victims. The first poop was obviously Frank. Old and weak, he had an accident, that's why he was so intent on destroying it. There were many turds before this one, weren't there, Frank? This was just the first time you got caught, wasn't it? And then you went and did it again the next night? Or did you? Two poops in two nights? Tall order for such a short man. No. The second poop belonged to Charles. He wanted to get back at Frank, but due to his poor diet, couldn't produce a turd. So he called Mac, who jumped at the chance to see Frank humiliated one more time. But Charlie overlooked the fact that Dennis listens to Mac's phone calls and he heard every word. Dennis was jealous that Charlie had chosen Mac to help instead of him. He swore to have his revenge. That's why encouraged Mac to sleep while he stayed up. He was going to put the frame on Mac by pooping next to him. But he didn't realize that a futon slept on by the weight of three men would be off its axis and slope to the center. And like a small brown snail it crept to the middle between Charlie and Frank. Deandra! You wanted in on this poop war from the start. No, I didn't. The outcast? The slut? The bitch. The whore. The lonely, sad, slutty, bitchy whore. You sat on the sidelines while these four titans battled it out. You were jealous that a few pieces of poop got more attention than you. That's why when the lights went out, you unleashed some thunder of you own. Thunder of the chocolate variety. Oh, well, that would be fine and dandy if any of it were true. Can we wrap this up at some point? In due time, pretty face. In due time. Isn't it true you thought you'd been pooping the bed for months now? You chalked it up to your old plumbing and penchant for spicy foods. Morning after morning, you'd bury your poop after you rose to hide it from Charlie. But convinced that Charlie had discovered his dirty little secret, Frank pooped the bed again the next night as revenge, only a lot more came out than he expected. He had gone too far. I've gone too far. Due to the size and severity of the poop, Frank concluded that Charlie had been pooping the bed all along. And so he cleaned up the mess and wandered the streets, looking for someone who could replicate Charlie's small and malnourished turd. And that's where he came upon his old friend, Rickety Cricket. Get up! Known the world over for his ability to replicate any man's stool, Cricket came back and committed fecal forgery. Which leads us to the third turd. Dennis and Mac thought it'd be funny to put the frame on Frank and Charlie, and so they both pooped. But, as so often happens, the poop rolled together and two became one. A turd merger fused together by fear and hatred and hair. But on to the final poop! A poop that can be traced back to Dee! But not to her butt. The waitress, drunk out of her mind and furious that Dee had pushed her back into the arms of the bottle, pooped in Dee's purse while Dee's back was turned. And Dee carried it unknowingly until she arrived here and the lights went out and she was startled, knocking her purse to the floor, causing the turd to tumble where it stands before us, right now. So, as you can see, the mystery of who pooped the bed has been solved. And yes my friends, in a way, you're all guilty. I did it.
 What?
 I did 'em all. I did all the poops.
 Really?
 Yeah, I did everyone of them. I even did one, while she was rappin us, right here.
 Dude!
 Jesus! God! Why would you do that, dude? Because poop is funny. I guess poop is very funny.
 Poop is funny.
 He pooped on the floor. You know what, well-played my man! Well-played! I hate my life. Seriously dude, don't ever poop in our bed again.                     Oh, it's just so doggone thin.
 Oh, it's incredibly thin.
 Yeah, it's thin, sure, but I got to say, I don't care for it. Charlie, the thinner the TV, the better the TV.
 That's just a straight-up fact.
 Guys, guys, guys! Check it out. We got a review in the paper. No way! Is it a good review? "The first thing I noticed about Paddy's Pub is its charm".
 All right, it's a good review.
 That's a good start.
 "It has none".
 Uh-oh, are you serious? "There was an ominous feeling that you could get stabbed at
 any moment". That's good, right?
 How is that good? That's the exact type of atmosphere I've been trying to cultivate. But, while danger may linger, I'm the levelheaded bouncer that keeps violence in check, like Swayze in Roadhouse. I'm the cooler. In check? There have been many stabbings in here.
 I feel unsafe here every single day.
 Oh, very often. Well, stabbings have been down, though. Read some more. "When I ordered a glass of wine, not only did the surly white trash waitress refuse to make it, but she proceed to call me a word that I cannot print in this paper".
 Surly?
 "I was forced to listen to the three classless bores who call themselves the owners get drunk and yell over each other all night". Classless bores? I am not a classless bore. Well, I am not white trash. I am a kind and a generous and a good-natured lady. Well, I I do seem to remember you calling a guy a faggot. Yeah, I absolutely called him a faggot, but he ordered chardonnay. What was I supposed to do? "Having reviewed every bar in Philadelphia, I hereby officially declare Paddy's Pub to be the worst bar in Philly". It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia 4x08 Hi. Are you Mr. Lyle Corman?
 Yes, can I help you?
 Good, nice to meet you. We're here from Paddy's Pub, and we have come down to give you the opportunity to give us another chance. Yeah, here's the thing. We felt that your first review was just a
 tiny bit off base.
 Yeah, as you can see, we're not white trash. Huh, really? Well, uh, then, in that case, can you ask your friend to put down that hammer, please? Uh, yeah, don't let the hammer throw you, Corman. We are classy, interesting people. Okay, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. Well, don't be rude. We just came to have a talk, so This is a private I'm gonna have to get security. Okay, we can play it that way, Corman. But you should know that we would have no problem suing you. Suing me? What are you gonna sue me for? Uh, libel, slander. There's two of the big dogs right there. It's only libel if what I write is false. You know what, buddy, we will jam your asshole up with so many lawyers, you won't know what to do with yourself. I'll have you know, we have a team of lawyers on retainer just to deal with people like you.
 Really?
 Yeah. Well, check this out.
 You're all out of time, bitch.
 Boom.
 You just got fazed.
 This just in, Poo-Poo Pants. People don't read newspapers anymore. How's that for class? Nice, brand-new Blu-Ray DVD player, all hooked up.
 Hey, all right.
 Where are we gonna put it? We need like a flat surface. Here we go. You know what, we'll just we'll dangle it. That looks better. We're not dangling anything. That's very white trash. What is the point of having all this expensive new status symbol stuff if we're just gonna make it look terrible? Hey, you guys want to see something? What? I did something. Holy shit. What? You kidnapped Corman? I don't really know what happened, okay? First, I was angry. Then, I was drinking. Next thing I know, I'm following this guy home and forcing him
 into the trunk of his own car.
 Jesus Christ, this is bad.
 Really bad.
 Don't panic. Don't panic. Relax, I drove him around in a circle for a while, okay, so he wouldn't know where he was or how far away he'd gone. But then you brought him back to a place where he's already been, and plus, he just heard everything you just said. Okay, maybe we can just release him, and that way, this won't be a kidnapping. First things first. Let's just get him out of the trunk; let's get him into the bar; and then let's figure out what we need to do. How are we gonna get him in the bar without anyone seeing him? Easy, we roll him up in a rug.
 Where are we gonna get a rug?
 We buy a big Oriental rug, and we roll him up in it. Do you have any idea how expensive rugs are, Charlie?
 Yeah, especially Oriental rugs.
 No, no rugs. Just get him out of the car and into the bar, Charlie. Help me get him out of the trunk. Okay, so we're we're really sorry about this, Mr. Corman. Watch your head. You're gonna be okay. It's not a kidnapping, so Oh, goddamn it. Okay, I think we're on the same page.
 This is not a kidnapping.
 No! No, okay, all right. But we do need to keep him here for a couple of hours
 so he doesn't do anything irrational.
 Just borrowing him. go to the police. That being said, let's take a few precautions here, okay? We need to cover our tracks. Why don't we shoot over to Corman's place and make sure that Charlie left without a trace. I'm pretty sure Charlie left with a trace.
 He probably did.
 That's a good idea. Okay, and I'll use my cooling abilities to smooth things over
 with Corman, and then that
 Jesus Christ. Are you still going on and on about being a cooler?
 Shut up.
 The cooler thing isn't helping now. Just get into the bar, and make sure Charlie doesn't do anything stupid. Okay, but can we establish that I'm the cooler?
 Oh, my God!
 Get into the bar. We're surrounded by idiots. Look, this really isn't necessary. You don't have to tape me I'm sorry, man, but this is the situation we're in, and I just feel like this is the best thing to do here. Jesus Christ, dude, what are you doing? You can't tape him up like that. Come on, man. I mean, the guy gets my goat, man. He sits around all day. He judges people with his words and his fancy newspaper talk. It's bullshit! What is it that you people want? Well, I'll tell you, Mr. Fancy Pants Writer Man. I was thinking maybe you could write a new review, you know, and this time, maybe add a few less lies. How can I write a new review if I am taped to a chair? Come on, man. See, he's twisting everything I say around. He's making me look like an asshole. Okay, look, look. Nobody has to write anything against their will, okay? Thank you. I have to go to the bathroom.
 I have to pee.
 Okay, sidebar. How is he gonna pee if his hands are taped down? I don't care. Let him piss in his pants. No, he can't piss in his pants, Charlie! I don't know why you're so in love with this guy. I just don't want to get arrested for kidnapping.
 If we just untie him for a second.
 Not gonna work. I used the last of the tape. If you untie him, that tape's not gonna stick back up. Go down to the basement. See if there's any more tape. I'll take him to the bathroom. I'll defuse the situation.
 Fine.
 Play it cool.
 Play it cool.
 Play it cool. I'm sorry I yelled at you, Mr. Corman. I saw that! I saw that! I saw that! You're out of here, bro. What are you doing? What, I'm packing to make it look like Corman went on a vacation. Yeah, but you're all over the place. You just put in a tropical shirt, and now two heavy coats? I mean, is he going to Cancun or Canada? You gotta pay attention to the details.
 This is how people get caught.
 Ah, shit, you're right. I'm leaving a trace. Okay no, no, no, no. He's probably under a lot of pressure with the deadlines from the newspaper.
 He should relax.
 Go someplace tropical?
 Cancun then. Perfect.
 Tropical. You know what I'll do? I will put an outgoing message on his answering machine.
 That is good thinking, sis.
 We're pretty good at this. We are pretty damn good at this. We're learning. Greeting one. Hi, this is Mehar. Sorry I missed your call. Please leave a message after the beep. Peace. That did not sound like Corman. Who are you people?
 Friends with Corman.
 Yeah. Mr. Corman lives across the hall.
 Oh, does he?
 Does he? Where is he? This is ridiculous.
 I really have to pee.
 I hear ya, bro. Now, back to the cooler conversation that we were having earlier. I feel like in your article, you missed an opportunity to mention my bouncing abilities. Okay? Now, it's really more about smarts than anything else. For example, if there was an altercation in this bathroom, I would blast in looking to neutralize, yeah? Now, I would check out my environment, and I would look to see if there's anything that I could use to my advantage. Like this pool cue. Here we go. Okay, normally, that wouldn't happen unless I wanted it to. 'Cause I could fire it right in your chest. 'Cause I got skills to do that. Dude, there's like no tape anywhere. All I could scrounge up was a bandana. No, that's too small. Oh, I could wear it though! I should wear it. I know, but I found it, so I sort of feel like No, I appreciate you looking for me and finding it for me. No, hang on a second. that got me to the point of me getting the bandana. Oh, you've got to be kidding me. Just please get me out of this bathroom before I vomit. It is absolutely disgusting. Well, excuse me, Mr. Man. But I happen to think this bathroom is pristine because I work very hard cleaning it. In fact it's so clean I would say you could eat out of these urinals. No, you absolutely could not eat out of these urinals.
 Oh, really? What's this?
 Charlie, don't. Char Oh, my God, dude! Bro, I really I just pissed in there,
 like five minutes before you came in.
 Don't say that.
 Now you're gonna make me look bad.
 Spit it out, man. You're gonna eat it?
 You're still chewing it.
 I have to prove a point! All right, all right. Just let me go to the bathroom. I will write the review. I'll do whatever you want. I promise. Well, now that wasn't so hard, was it? Great. Awesome. Well, I think that we're we're in good shape then. How are we gonna do this? Well, I think one of us is gonna have to help his Whoa, dude! I'm not touching his dick. Well, Charlie, you're the one that used all the tape. Well, I was comfortable with letting him piss in his pants. Well, all right, fine. Then compromise. We'll both do it. That way it's equally weird for both of us. No, no, no. Fine. Just-just untape me. Please. No. Oh, no. No! No! Can I bring something up?
 Did he get a little bit hard on us?
 Can we not talk about this? I just felt like you got a little bit It was very weird.
 Well, why did it move?!
 Hey, guys!
 We got a problem.
 We did something.
 Oh, man!
 Oh, man! What happened, dude? Well, there was this a slight mix-up with the apartments. This is Corman's neighbor Mehar. What happened to doing this without a trace? Well, it-it's a long story, but the punch line is that
 he starting asking questions
 I asked one question.
 Shut up!
 No, you asked a lot of questions. All right, well, let's not have him ask more questions. Let's just keep him in the trunk for now. You can't kidnap more people to cover up the original kidnapping.
 It's a classic mistake.
 I'm sorry I didn't know there was a handbook on kidnapping.
 Help!
 We gotta get him inside.
 It's probably very hot in there.
 There's another bit of an issue, which is that I locked the keys in the trunk just now.
 What?!
 Yeah.
 Are you kidding me?
 Well, I didn't want to bring that up. Goddamn it, Charlie! This is what we're gonna do. You guys deal with the situation out here. Let's go talk to Corman. He's writing that new review. Okay, 'cause I don't want to see that man right now.
 We don't really want
 Because we had a whole thing. What happened? Something happened. None of your business.
 Thank you very much.
 We had a thing amongst the
 Let's just go inside.
 Can you just please. How long do you think we can hold that inside? It's burning me up inside. It's burning me up. There he is. Our little typer.
 Type, type, typing away.
 Don't mean to disturb ya. Oh, you're not disturbing me at all. It's great to see you two again. I get it. I get it.
 You are too much, huh?
 You're being a smart-aleck.
 You are.
 Glad your spirits are still up. Listen, we wanted to come in and just let you know we're sorry about this whole tie-up-and-hold-you-here thing. We didn't have anything to do with it. No, that wasn't us. That was somebody else's idea.
 Not our idea.
 You know what I'm saying? Now if there's anything though that we can do,
 since we are in this situation
 Absolutely, together we are.
 you want to let us know.
 Anything at all. Yeah, how about, uh, letting me go. There he goes again.
 I didn't know he was so funny.
 I didn't know he was gonna ask for food or something. Is there something else we can get you though? 'Cause clearly, you know, we can't All right, a glass of white wine, maybe a chardonnay.
 Now you're talking.
 You like white wine. I know that. Um, also, do you want me to bring you some lipstick with that? Boom! You got fazed again, Corman. You can't just tee her up and expect her not to take a swing at you, right?
 Can't blame her for that one.
 Can't blame her for that one. Hey, since you are writing a new review, uh, is there anything I can do to help you out with it? Uh, you want to fire a couple questions my way?
 No, I think I'm fine.
 Okay. Yeah, hey, no problem, man. I just want to just want to make sure you got the total picture on me 'cause I do drive a Range Rover.
 Gas guzzler.
 Well, not on the highway. Okay. Yeah, it's very classy vehicle, though. What do you want me to say? What do I want you to say? I don't know, "Dennis Reynolds, your car is awesome. Your flat screen TV I took a look at it. It's very, very thin. It speaks volumes about you as a person". I don't know; give me something I can work with, Corman. All right, Dennis. Here's the deal. I didn't feel like opening up a bottle of wine so I brought you some scotch 'cause I feel like that's what writers should drink. Hey, some top-shelf scotch. Uh, I don't drink scotch. Well, you don't have to be a dick about it. Got a real chip on her shoulder, this one. If I had to write an article about you, it would say that you're very negative. The headline might be: "Most negative man in the world calls other people white trash to make himself not feel so faggy". Faggy? You mind if I just took a quick peek at your new review there?
 Uh, but I haven't
 That's okay. That's okay. I know you're not finished. I just want to see what direction we're headed in there, buddy. What's it say? It's, uh, pretty heavy on the kidnapping aspect. It is? You jam in further though. This is Unlock the bottom. I'm going for whatever's down there and, um, it won't catch on to anything is the problem, man. Damn it, dude. I feel like this should be easier! People break into cars all the time. You know, a piece of me wants to chalk this whole guy-in-the-trunk thing up to a loss right now, dude. We can't do that, bro. We gotta get him out of the car. Well, then why don't you just let me take the hammer and smash the window and we'll just pop the trunk. Charlie, if we're gonna smash the window, I would simply do it with a roundhouse kick. Oh, come on, you're not gonna be able to break this window with a roundhouse kick. Let's get serious here. Charlie, I've never been more serious about anything in my entire life. Help! Please let me out. I have to get home. I have a cat. Sir, we all have cats that we'd like to be playing with right now, okay? We're doing our very best. My cat is diabetic. She needs her insulin shot. Please! So we got to babysit a cat now? I can't have a dead cat's blood on my hands, man.
 That's not good.
 All right, Mac to the rescue. Let me just back up. I'm gonna roundhouse this. I'm gonna kick it, and then we can get it. Kick it, man. All right, but back up, 'cause I don't want the glass to shatter at your face.
 All right, go.
 Guard your eyes.
 Oh, no!
 Shit, dude! Shit! There is a slope in the ground, and I didn't I wasn't, I wasn't calibrating that great. You just totally broke this mirror, bro. Well, it's the bullshit street. We gotta get that zoning people out here. I don't think it's the street, bro. Don't touch the window, all right? I'll do that when I get back. I gonna grab his cat with Dennis' car. I'll be back. Learn how to kick. Take one karate class if you're so into karate, you know? That is a really, really nice setup. Now, if he doesn't go for that, he's just a straight-up retard.
 I mean, that's all there is to it.
 Hey, buddy. Oh, hey, pal. Oh, check out this new setup, man. This is going to be our golden ticket, man. This is really going to get us somewhere. Hey, man, do you see any hypodermic needles laying around?
 What the hell is that?
 Mehar's cat. Diabetic. Now a diabetic cat is in play? Jesus, we can't catch a break.
 I know, tell me about it.
 Nice and easy now. Jesus Christ, Charlie! You broke the window? Dude, the guy had to take a dump. What was I supposed to do? Wait, he's all tied up. How did you? Let's not talk about how it happened, okay? It just happened.
 Give him his cat.
 Dude, your cat's freaking out! That's not my cat.
 No, Dee.
 What the hell you doin', Dee? What's Mehar doing here?
 What are you doing with my cat?!
 Your cat?!
 Yes! What is going on?
 Mr. Corman, why are they doing this? No, no, no. Get out of here! Give him his cat and get him back in the office. Jesus Christ, oh, this is bad. This is bad, man. This is really bad. You guys, this is bad. What are we gonna do? We gotta come up with a plan fast! Go it! Ready? Here's the plan. I've been thinking about this. Okay, we give them amnesia. It's so easy, here how you do it. You smash them both over the head with a bottle. They go down like a ton of bricks, okay? Then we drag them back to their apartments, we put them in their beds, you know? We set their clocks back. We get yesterday's newspaper. We put it on their front doorstep. They wake up thinking it was all a dream.
 That's so goddamn stupid!
 What?! It's so stupid. Mac, please tell me you got something.
 I say we bribe them.
 A bribe.
 We bribe them.
 A good, old-fashioned bribe. No, that's not gonna work, you know why? Corman's not gonna go for that. He's, like, made of stone or something. Oh, Mehar! Let's bribe Mehar.
 He'd go for it.
 Yeah, Mehar could work. But I did notice that the kidnapping has rubbed him the wrong way. So whatever we bribe him with, it's got to be worth a lot of money. Yeah, he's gonna want something good for sure. For sure. Jesus Christ, no. Hey, thanks a lot for taking home Corman's cat. And good luck with your sick cat. Goddamn it, this is bullshit. All right, let's go talk to Corman. Hold on there, Corman.
 Where are you going, buddy?
 Where are you going? You're not going very fast. You're just wasting a lot of energy. Stop. Okay, all right. Listen, man, we got a proposal for you, okay? Yeah, now we are willing to not force you to write that review if you are willing to step up, do the right thing and
 not tell anybody that this happened.
 I don't care. Whatever it takes to get me out of this bar
 away from you people.
 My man. That is the attitude we were waiting for the whole time. That's right, man. Where's this guy been? Now, let's talk about the elephant in the room. Let's talk about the pressing charges. Yeah, we're gonna need you to sign something.
 Fine. Whatever it takes.
 I can't believe you guys are gonna try and cut a deal with this weasel. The guy's a liar! He lied to us, man. He said he was going to write a review, he didn't do that. I touch his dick. Mac, we touched his dick. Now is not the time to talk about that.
 Why were you guys touching his dick?
 There wasn't enough tape and
 So you touched his dick?!
 Move past it. Let's plow through it. Okay, Mr. Corman, why don't you just go ahead and sign this. And then I'll fill in the blanks later. Then that way, we'll have a confession, it'll be great. And there you go. Okay, now, let me just get this tape off you, and you could be on your way. Now, we won't charge you for the duct tape. That was a joke. Shit, bro! What are you doing, dude?! I really don't like this guy.
 You're an idiot!
 Well, we'll see who's the idiot when he wakes up tomorrow and doesn't remember a thing. I don't think that's how it works, Charlie.
 It's definitely not how it works, man.
 Oh, my God! We may as well embrace the amnesia angle, because we have
 no other options at this point.
 Well, now! Okay, I'll go get yesterday's newspaper. Okay, you guys ready? One, two, three. And I'll take With me the memories To be my sunshine After the rain It's so hard To say good-bye To yesterday I ran out. I ran out of breath. Check it out. What you got there, Ernie? Oh, it's a new review by Corman. "I woke up in my neighbor's bed with a head wound, yesterday's paper, and an empty bottle of sleeping pills, and my nightmare in that putrid, shithole of a bar, Paddy's Pub, finally, mercifully came to an end. The owners all deserve to rot in jail, though having to spend every day with each other in that violent establishment is a decidedly great punishment. That is why I decided to not press charges leaving 'em to live in the hell on earth that they've created for themselves for the rest of their pathetic and miserable lives.
 Really cold what he's been writing.
 It's wrotten there.
 Not a good review.
 No, it's not a good review. Right for the throw. At least, he didn't mention our names. No charges, no names. I don't know why, but I'm a little irritated that
 he didn't mention our names.
 I feel like he'd to mentien our names. I increadibly annoid that he didn't mention our names. I whish I can live with this but I can't. It's a history about us!
 I feel like we go talk to him, again.
 We should talk to him.
 We're capable of being civils, right ?
 Let's just, you know Communication is the key, it make sens. Uh, my hammer again.                     What were you even doing in that crawl space, Charlie? Well, for starters, I was minding my own business. I was also trying to do a little light reading, and then I was putting some cheese in the rat traps. You were putting the cheese in the rat traps?
 Can I smell your mouth?
 Why? You were eating the cheese, weren't you, out of the rat traps? No! Well, yes. I mean, I was eating the old cheese to test it, see why the rats weren't eating it. Why are you always doing such weird things, Charlie? I do weird things? Name another thing that you think is weird. I caught you stealing a bunch of coins out of the fountain at Logan Circle. I was acquiring a little bit of cash to pay my spy, Dee.
 Why do you have a spy?
 To spy the waitress.
 Of course I have a spy.
 Is that normal to you? Shut up and give me my book back, please. Hey, guys, what book you keep going on and on about? It's nothing. You don't need to see it. My God! Whoa! These are my these are my memoirs. Charlie, you found my book! I wrote a memoirs. Hey, guys, Charlie found my memoirs! Your memoirs? I've been keeping track of all my sexual exploits, and I was going to unleash them on the world in a fiery blaze of eroticism. Slow down a second, Dennis.
 You wrote a book?
 It's more of a tale of redemption
 told through my erotic travels.
 Giddyup, man! That's amazing. That's good stuff, right? Yeah. But then, one day, the book just sort of went mysteriously missing. Charlie, what the hell were you doing with it? Well, since he can't read, I'm guessing he was masturbating to your pictures.
 Goddamn! Jacking off to my
 No, no! That's Not at all! You know, what are you doing to me? Why are you doing this? You've been riding me. Now you're accusing me of things. You just don't get it. You don't know why I do the things that I do. It's nuts! You don't know how hard I got it, Dee. You've got it pretty tough? Your life is pretty hard? How would you like to walk a mile in my shoes? Try your old buddy Charlie on for size. You want me to walk a mile in your shoes 'cause I can't handle your big, tough life? I will. That sounds fine to me. I will do that. Oh, my God! Shut up! Dennis, what's the name of this book? Dennis Reynolds: An Erotic Life. Guest: Sososeries "I removed my robe and stood before her taut, nubile, proud. "She was much, much older than me, but her breasts were awesome. "I felt reborn, baptized in erotic majesty."
 Yeah!
 This is some sweet smut!
 I'm all boned up over here.
 Me, too! Dennis, we should try and sell this book. Personal memoirs are huge right now. Yeah, yeah. No. I'm going to sell the book, okay, but I'm not going to let you guys be involved because, every time you're involved, you get all excited about something, and then you give up the minute we hit the first speed bump. You need us, Dennis. You're going to need some legal help. Legal help? What the hell you talking about, man? Bro, half the stories you just read us are total bullshit. They're not bullshit. What are you saying? Dennis, you were never the personal sexual adviser to Jon Bon Jovi! And you never woke up in a rehab facility with the wounds of Christ miraculously appearing on your hands and feet! Yeah, man, but I did I banged that girl in the fountain. That story was true the hot dog, the oatmeal, everything. Dude, you don't want to end up like that Million Little Pieces guy, okay? Oprah made him look like a total dick. That guy was a turd. I mean, come on. Just take some of those stories out. You can't take those stories out. That's the rub! That's why he needs us. Because the public loves those crazy celebrity stories and rehab shit. Okay, well, so what are you thinking? I'm thinking we take some of the really good stories, you know the Jon Bon Jovi, the Christ wound stigmatas and we recreate them. We make them true so that people can't prove that they didn't happen! My God! Recreate some of the better stories in here,
 and then we have proof!
 Yes! Holy shit, man! That's a good idea. Now, first things first. We got to figure out how to get you into rehab. Charlie, do I really have to sleep here? Dee, if you're going to walk a mile in my shoes, this is a pretty big part of that mile, don't you think?
 Here. Put these on.
 No. I don't want to wear one of your dirty sleeping outfits. I'm sorry, Dee, but my "outfits," as you like to call them, serve a very specific purpose, all right? This isn't just for fun. I don't have any heating ducts in this apartment. It gets freezing in here at night, all right? Now, in case you have to pee-pee, I got this for you, all right?
 Oh, my God!
 Goddamn it! Frank was supposed to empty that. Totally, no wonder! It reeks in here! You have open cans of pee everywhere! Well, I'm sorry, but you do not want to use that bathroom! Now, eat one of these, all right? You're going to want to huff a little glue and drink some beer.
 This is cat food, Charlie.
 Dee, I can explain it, all right? There's some sort of weird chemical reaction that happens when you combine cat food, beer and glue. It makes you feel, like, extremely sick and tired.
 You're able to fall asleep.
 Why would I want to make myself extremely sick and tired? 'Cause there's going to be about 50 cats howling outside that window all night long, and you have no idea how loud 50 cats can be. Okay, maybe there wouldn't be cats surrounding your building if you didn't have open cans of cat food everywhere. I have 50 cats howling outside my window because I have 10,000 rats running around my building, Dee, okay?!
 Stop yelling.
 I'm not an idiot! There's a reason to do the things that I oh! It's starting right on time. If I were you, I'd start wolfing that shit down. I got to go to sleep. I'm not feeling good at all. Come play with us forever and forever, and forever Occupado. Wake up! Let's go! Time to start the day!
 Time to get up!
 Charlie! God! God! There's evil twins in the in the hallway, and a twitching junkie in What? How much of that glue did you huff? I don't know. As much as you did. As much as me? Really? Well, that's probably way too much glue for you, Dee. Hey, check it out. You just had yourself a glue O.D., and those are pretty regular in my life, so you learned another lesson: Don't do too much glue or your night sucks. Hold on a second. You're saying that your life is so terrible because you eat rat cheese and cat food and huff glue all day long? Yeah. Those aren't real problems, Charlie. What do you mean, they're not real problems? You make those problems up. You choose to do that stuff.
 Those are solutions to problems.
 Oh, my God! You know what? Hold on a second. We're going to turn the tables here. You're going to walk a mile in myshoes now, and you're going to see what it's like to live in the real world and have actual problems. Okay. You got some glue on your face, Dee. You might want to wash it off. Damn it. Okay, plan is simple. You're gonna hang out at the rehab facility for a couple a days while we get the ball rolling with Bon Jovi. Yeah, I gotta say I'm a little skeptical about you guys being able to get in touch with Jon Bon Jovi. What? What do you mean? He's from New Jersey.
 Piece of cake.
 Have a little faith in us, please. Plus, it's easy. We just get you into a room with him, snap a couple of photos, we got proof, bing-bang-boom, we're done. Now let's talks stigmatas. Right. Do we have to do the stigmatas? Dennis, you know that this publisher is gonna have a fact checker, right?
 Yeah.
 You don't want to end up like the Million Little Pieces guy, do you? I brought a nail gun. Is that what that is? Look, you're not gonna shoot nails in me. No, I think a couple of severe burns from the cigar is what's gonna do the trick. No, no, no, you need deep wounds.
 This'll give you deep wounds.
 Hold on a second, no!
 Nobody's gonna burn me!
 Dennis, calm down! Calm down! You focus on your art, okay? Frank and I will handle the business end of things. If you guys really want to do the stigmata thing Okay, good work, Frank. Now I think we should just probably leave the body right here, right? And then in the morning, they'll come out and find him. All right, give me his hands. So I don't go to a therapist. I just go to bars. If you walk up to the nearest drunk guy and bup him from behind, he always turns around and goes, "Hey, man, what's your problem?". Dee, this guy is great! Do you come here every night? Every night? This is great. Hey, do the have food, too? 'Cause I could go for some food. No, no, no food. I don't eat when I'm here.
 Well, when do you eat?
 I don't. Why don't you eat dinner, Dee? You got to eat dinner sometime. Because when you perform, your nerves make you dry heave, and you'd better hope that you don't have any food in your stomach.
 You gonna perform?
 All right. Now this next lady you all know because she's here almost every night. Let's hope she's got some new jokes this time. Everybody, put your hands together for Deandra Reynolds! Howdy, howdy, howdy. How's everybody doing tonight? So, you guys, what's the deal with those hands-free headsets that everybody's wearing in their ears, right? It's, like, "Hey, everybody, look at me. I'm one part robot, three parts asshole". Jesus Christ! I mean, am I right That's good. Well, at least it was short and dry this time. Dee, what are you doing to yourself? That is terrible! Why would you do that? You just gotta put in your dues, Charlie, you know? You gotta take it one step at a time when you want to be an actor. Just climb to the top. What? This is about being an actor? Why in God's name are you still trying to be an actor? Okay, we all have our hopes and dreams, Charlie. You're still trying to get with the waitress, I'm still trying to act. We just do whatever we need to do. Is it funny? You'd better get ready, guy, 'cause you're next. for a newcomer here tonight, Mr. Charlie Kelly! So, you guys, you ever eat cheese? Cheese is funny thing. Cheese is a strange thing. I always wonder, like, "What is cheese? Where does it come? We gotta figure out how to get you into rehab. Let's talk stigmatas. Deep wounds. Get you in rehab Rehab Rehab Yo, punk, wake up, punk. Yo, punk. Wake up!
 What the hell?
 Yeah, you in hell, all right! Know what? My name is Sinbad. This is Sinbad's house! When you in Sinbad house, you my bitch! Yeah, you know who that is? That's Rob Thomas from Matchbox 20. Sing a song. Shut up! Matchbox 20. You the man, huh?
 You gonna punk him like that?
 No-no-no! Stay back, man. No, matter of fact, unleash the fury. Get his shoe!
 What?
 Beat his testicles! No, no, no, don't, don't! Come on. Rob Thomas and Sinbad, look, I'm pretty confused about what I'm seeing here, I'm in a lot of pain. I just don't know what's going on. It's the pain, huh? My bad, I didn't know you was hurting like that. My bad. 'Cause I've hurt before, you've hurt before, we all hurt. So I'm just gonna break it down. I introduce myself right. That was wrong. I'm Sinbad. That's my head shot. I'll autograph it for you a little later on. And this is Sinbad's house, and you my bitch!
 And I'm gonna show you
 Everything okay in here? Hey, what's up, Jerome? What you doing? He keep throwing his shoe. He crazy. Okay, well, let's go. Everybody should be in bed with the lights off. We trying to go to sleep. He keep throwing shoes at us. Man, you about to get me jacked up, man. Is that what you're trying to do? Shut up! Man, I'll poke your eye out! See this? This one you, this one Rob Thomas. I own both of y'all. Watch your ass, new-meat! All rightie, then. See you soon. Bye-bye.
 Hey, dude.
 I just made a date
 with that girly rock star's people.
 Bon Jovi?! Yeah, he owns the Philadelphia Soul, the arena football team. I just offered to buy it. Awesome! All right, now I'm gonna pretend that I have terminal cancer and get him to do an acoustic set on my deathbed. Wait, wait, why would you do that?
 You don't have to do that.
 No, it's great bro. Rock stars do the cancer-kid thing all the time. Look, Frank, you got us into a room with Jovi's people, right? I'm gonna get us into a room with Jovi himself. I'm sorry. That's a stupid idea and I don't want you to do it. Well, I already got a bald-cap guy and everything. You're just confusing everything. There's nothing confusing about it, Frank. It's very Shut up! Shut your big mouth right now! I will put my foot down right now. You are not going in there with that cancer thing, I don't care what you say! So get it out of your head! Okay. Jesus, dude, won't do the cancer thing. Relax. So, Mr. Reynolds, you're interested in buying our arena football team? Big time! But I want to do business with Mr. Von Joni himself.
 Bon Jovi.
 Yeah, Mr. Bovine Joni himself. I'm offering $40 million for the team. Well, that is a very generous offer, but, I must admit I'm a little bit confused about one thing. What's confusing about $40 million? That's a shitload of money. It is, it is. I'm a little confused as to why you've chosen to involve this gentleman here. Well, if I may, I'd like to explain to you why I'm here. Ma'am, I am dying of very terminal cancer, and I would like to request a private bedside concert from Mr. Bon Jovi. Now, Sambora's presence is not necessary, but it would be nice if he was involved. Question: is this a laser pointer?
 Yes.
 Can I have it? No.
 I'm gonna take it anyway.
 Please don't listen to anything he says.
 I'll give you $60 million for the team.
 Frank, Frank? Thank you. I got it. We're talking about cancer. Nobody cares about arena football anymore. You're not negotiating shit. We're onto the cancer thing now, and that is the way it's gonna go from here. Okay, I'm just gonna throw this out there. I don't think you have cancer. What? What are you talking about? No, that's chemo, that's chemotherapy right there. For the record, when you go through chemo,
 your beard hair falls out, too.
 Are you sure?
 I told you
 I asked a lot of people.
 not to do the cancer thing.
 I asked my bald-cap guy. But it was working until you got in with the bullshit numbers. Goddamn it. You know, I'm not even really bald? I have a full head of hair. Not like him. Not only do I consider it magnificent, but I have a sneaking suspicion it's pretty good. His eyes. Shine it on his dick. Shine it on his dick. That's me, that's my phone. Hey, dude, where you been?
 I'm in rehab, dude.
 Yeah. Hey, that whole Jovi thing went south, so I think we're just gonna scrap the whole book ordeal. What are you talking about?
 I got another call, buddy.
 No-no, no, don't! Hello. Yo, Bill, what's happening?
 Who you looking for?
 Bill. Who's this? This is Mac. You got the wrong number.
 Oh, my bad.
 Yeah, no, it's no problem. What number were you trying to call?
 Hello.
 Frank, you got to get me out of here. Where are you? I'm in rehab, goddammit! Well, I'm in a movie, and this broad's about to get naked,
 so I got to go.
 Yeah, no, that's okay.
 Yeah, I thought it was some chick.
 Who are you talking to? I'm talking to Bill.
 And anyway, so
 No, no, no, I'm not Bill, I'm Terry. I'm sorry, no, it's Terry. Sorry about that, Terry. Anyway, this cat people Terry? What number did he want? Will you please shut up?!
 What's that?
 I got some dick in a movie theater
 giving me shit.
 Why are you turned around like that?
 Nice talking to you.
 Yeah, call me back. I'll talk to you afterwards. Bye. Give me the laser pointer. Just give me the laser pointer.
 What a jerk.
 I know, but watch this. I'm gonna do it right in the back of his head. Bro you wore the battery down. Well, how am I supposed to use it now? 'Cause you jerk.
 I'm a jerk?
 Yeah, you're a jerk. You're walking around with that bald cap on all day and I'm a jerk. It was expensive. I'm sorry, I want to get my money's worth. Will you please be quiet?! Who talks like this in the middle of a movie theater? Hey hey, you don't know how hard I got it, pal. You don't know how tough it is being me. What? It's not that tough to be you, Frank. What is so difficult about your life? Try walking a mile in my shoes once in a while and then talk to me. "Our eyes locked, our hands touched, and she whispered in my ear, 'Dude, your balls totally rule'". What the hell you think you doing, man?! I heard about this shit! This gonna stop! Take his book, Rob. Whoa, wait, man, what Come on, man, I was just in the middle of some really erotic stuff. Yeah, I heard about that shit. You trying to write "memoirs," erotic shit. You know what? You don't write it, bitch,
 I write it!
 What is your problem, Sinbad? Think you Jesus? You think you Jesus? Ain't no Jesus here except me, I'm Jesus. What the hell, man?! You stole my thing. No, no, it's my thing, it's bigger. Rule of the land: bigger. It's my thing now. Took it. Bam. Mine. Fine, but what is Rob Thomas have to do with any of this? You know, Rob, know what he got to do with it? He do whatever I tell him to do 'cause he's my bitch, bitch! Let's get up out of here, man. Get that, we're gonna read some smut.
 Come on, man
 Shut up! Give it to him. No, I'm playing! I got to get out of here. This is my day, and this is where I come at the end of the day before I head off to Paddy's. Why do you come to the fountain? The fountain's my thing, Dee. Well, I'll tell you why I come to the fountain, Charlie. I come every single day to throw money into this thing to wish for a better life. Money that you apparently steal for spys. Okay? So essentialy, Charlie, you're stealing my dreams, and if you don't mind, I'll go get those dreams back. That was my spy coins. That's my money anyway. That wasn't your money. I mean, that's what I have to go through
 to get laid.
 Frank, shut up. You're just pissed off because I pooled it of better than you. You don't pooled it of better than anyone. You better not loose your hair, you ugly bold-hair. I was ugly as you bitch.
 What are we doing here?
 This is the time of de day
 when I come to the fountain.
 Why? When I was a kid, I used to swim in this fountain. A bunch of bowlings, kick me out. So I waited to this time of the day, and come back, and pissed in the fountain. I've been pissing in the fountain for 50 years. Why are you still pissing in it? To get back at their kids.
 Crazy, crazy
 You can have a good life with Isn't Dee and Charlie?
 Hey, guys, what are you doing?
 What the hell These are my dreams. They mean something to me.
 Charlie and Dee! Dee!
 Hey!
 What are you doing?
 I'm taking my dreams back.
 What are you guys doing?
 Frank is here to piss in the fountain.
 I do it every day.
 Hey, I like you haircut, man.
 That's a great look.
 You can't tell that I'm bold.
 Oh, my God!
 You can't tell?! Time out. Did you see where I pissed in the fountain? Hey, Dennis! What's up buddy, come here! What you doing? I use this fountain for killing powers. Plus, it's very good for my skins. But that's not the point right now. You aren't gonna believe this. Sinbad tried to kill me.
 What?
 Sinbad, and the other comedians were in the rehab center and tried to kill me. and then Rob Thomas, the lead singer of Matchbox 20, was there too. Did it make sense? No. Time out. Time out. Time out.
 Did you, or did you not meet Sinbad?
 Yeah, I met Sinbad.
 Can you prove that stuff?
 Yeah, it happens minutes ago. Memoires are back. The story with the doush bag, the public eats that shit.
 The memoire thing is gone.
 You have to go back there. No, we can go back. That's too dangerous. No, Dennis, we have to prove, we have to make photos, we have to sign documents.
 I'm a huge Sinbad fan. I've all his
 Sinbad is not the man that I am not going back there. I hope he's writting something on a windbreaker.
 Okay guys, this is it.
 What the hell is this? It's the rehab center. That's not the rehab center. That's the rehab center. Well, this is where they drop me after you guys drop me off. Everybody, you stay close to me. Okay? You have to protect me. Because like most comedians, Sinbad is very angry on the inside.
 Come on, come on.
 You think he will autograph my shirt? He will autograph your face until it gets bloody. It's like What is this place, dude? Hey! Hell, no! We told you to not come back here, freak! Where is Sinbad? You call me Sinbad one more time,
 I will knock you out.
 What the hell is going on here? This dude broke in here, running around, talking about memoires and Sinbad. So you lied to us, Dennis? No, I didn't lie. I sware to God, it was all real, Sinbad was here, I swear.
 That's it, I'm calling the cops.
 You thought that dude was Sinbad. Maybe that load in the head did more damage that we thought.
 That's not Sinbad, dude.
 I know that's not Sinbad. Is that a sort of sick fantasy? No, it's not a fantasy, I didn't make it up, Sinbad was here, I sware. Guess what guys, the memoires is dead, again. I can believe you didn't meet Sinbad. You realize how excited I was to meet Sinbad? That wasn't a comedian, that was some dude in green pants. I don't know how all this happened, it all seemed so real. I need to see a doctor. No, you don't, bitch! Wake up! Yeah, you in hell, all right!
 I'm Jesus.
 What the hell, man?! You call me Sinbad one more time Yeah, I should definitely see a doctor.                     [Dennis] Stop it. [Charlie] All right. You're getting hung up on "can't." And I'm not saying that you can't. I'm saying that it is illegal. No, it is not illegal! Dude. Says the guy who knows nothing about the law! I can absolutely keep a hummingbird as a pet, bro. It's no different than having a parrot, or a parakeet. It's a bird, bro. You really can't, and I'm not saying I agree with it. It's just that bird law in this country- it's not governed by reason. There is no such thing as bird law. Yes, there is! I'm gonna get a hummingbird, and I'll show you. You guys, I have huge news. Hummingbirds are illegal tender. I'm gonna get one. You cannot. To spite you, I'm gonna get one. Hello? Where are we with gulls? You guys! You can keep a gull as a pet. But you do not want to live with a seabird, 'cause the noise level alone on those things Have you ever heard a gull up close? It's gonna blast your eardrums out, dude. You guys, I'm serious! I have huge news here! The principle is that you can have any bird that- Yo! I got great news, guys. Frank's got news? Frank's got news? [Chanting] News, news, news, news! News, news, news, news, news, news, news, news! I just bought a house at a foreclosure auction. Holy shit! That's amazing. Oh, is it? Is it "amazing"?
 Now hang on. You're not moving out, are you?
 No, no, no, no. I bought this as an investment. I bought it on the cheap. Ah, you might've missed the boat on that, Frank. Not the best time to invest. I beg to differ with you. Now is the time to invest because all the prices are low. As soon as the market turns around, I'm gonna make a boatload. Frank's talking about flipping the house. Flip the house! Making some money! That's exciting. I'm having a baby! Do yourself a favor and flush it out. No. That's not- "Flush it out"? No. I'm not pregnant. I I answered an ad for a couple who wants a surrogate. See, people who can't have kids are willing to pay a shitload of money to people like myself, who can carry it for them. Wait. What's going on? You're carrying someone's baby somewhere? H-Hold it. I am not spending money on another little bastard.
 I did that already, twice.
 Come on. No. They're keeping the baby. It's their baby. How are you guys not understanding this? Uh, Dee, before you continue this babbling, does your thing involve us in any way, or are you just kind of- at us? Well, no. It's just that's huge news, so I figured you guys might want to know. It doesn't matter. Let's just talk about the house! Let's talk about the house! Hold on one second. Actually, Dee being pregnant is pretty big news. Now, we could take the house idea and the baby idea and merge the two things. It just feels muddy though. Let's just stick with one. It's cleaner, right?
 It could be an interesting-
 House. But I'm just saying that if- House. I don't know exactly how we would take the two ideas and put them together. House! But I think if we came up with something [Chanting] House! House! House! Just the house thing? House! House! House! House! House, house, house, house, house, house, house, house, house, house! Flush, flush, flush! Deandra? Thank you so much for responding to our ad in the paper. You're welcome. We've had so many letdowns going through the agency. Yeah. We thought we'd just try to find a surrogate by ourselves. I just feel really honored to be able to provide a service for a lovely couple like yourselves. Good. Thank you. Yeah. We just had a couple questions we'd like to ask you. Shoot. Honey, why don't you- Okay. So- Sorry. But do you have any history with drugs or alcohol? Never. Neither. That's great. Um, any- any family history of mental illness? Uh, well, my brother's a dick, if that counts. I don't- I don't think so. It's just a joke though, Sean. So, the next one? And- And- Okay. So what about your medical history? Is there any health problems we should know about? Kate, I'm gonna be honest with you. I have never had a health problem in my entire life. Wow. Clean as a whistle. That's amazing.
 Down here, up here, wherever.
 This is all great news. I mean Isn't it? Yes, it really is. Okay, great. So let's talk turkey. And by that, I mean money. Oh. We just thought we'd pay the standard rate of $20,000. Yeah. I like the sound of that. I'm gonna throw something at you guys, so brace yourselves. What are your thoughts on doubling down, so to speak, and going for twins? [Chuckles] Right? No. No. If it's a matter of price, I'm willing to cut you a deal on the second one. And we don't have to stop at two. I've typed up a price sheet I would like the two of you to peruse. If you'll look down around number four or five, that's when you really start to see some savings. You guys want to go for an Octomom thing? Huh? I'm game. You want to have 10? You want to outdo that bitch? I'll have that conversation. I'm kidding. I don't want 10 people inside of me. But- This is great. I-I just- I think we're really just gonna do the one, I think is- is what we want. One baby. Look for shit on the walls, 'cause that's what they do. When they know they're getting thrown out of a house, they smear feces all over the walls. Really? Yes. They didn't do that here. This is a pretty nice house. A little lived in maybe. Well, you know, I found something cooking on the stove. That's pretty "unresponsible." Mac and cheese. I can't believe they left all this stuff in the house. I mean, what's the deal? Do we have to burn it?
 Hey, get the hell out of our house!
 Jesus. There's people here!
 Squatters!
 We're not squatters! This is our house! What do you mean your house? I bought this house! We own this house! You didn't buy it from us! You bought it from the bank. We didn't sell it. Oh, look, bitch! We bought it from them because they foreclosed on your bitch ass! Yeah, yeah. You got proof? Proof? What are you talking about, proof? A deed, paperwork. Go get your proof. Proof. Bring it back here. We'll look at the paperwork. Is that what you want? You want proof? I'll give you proof! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Frank, take it easy, bud. Take it- You gotta use your head now. Think about the law. All right? What happens if you accidentally hit a child with an umbrella? In the eyes of the law, that is child abuse. What happens then? In the eyes of the law, you have to give your properties to the parents of that child. I'm sorry, little kid. He doesn't know the law that well. I don't even know what the hell he's talking about. It doesn't matter. We shouldn't bash these people up. No. No! Of course we shouldn't bash these people up! Look- Okay. Absolutely, we could cave the husband's skull in here. Yes, we could take the wife down to the basement, have a frenzied free-for-all with her. We could tie the kids up in their rooms so they wouldn't hear any of it. Dennis, in that scenario, we'd have to kill the kids 'cause they would've seen our faces. Right. We could smear the walls with their blood. Guys, there are any number of twisted scenarios that could play out here. But I think the easiest thing, really, is to just go get the deed. Right. Why get weird? Let's just keep it simple. For now, we take the high road. We'll take the high road. Take the high road out of here. Oh, well, I'm so glad we're gonna get to work with you, Deandra. Oh, Kate, Sean, I tell you what. You guys are getting one hell of a uterus. Great. Okay. Well, listen. It was really nice to meet you. Wow! This house really opens up here, doesn't it? Uh- From the curb, it doesn't really look like much. But once you get inside, it's got a real ass on it. Well, thank you. It's always felt a little empty without a family. Oh, shit! Is that a pool? Uh, yeah. Of course, when the baby comes, we'll have a fence around it. Right, right, right. How deep? The pool? Yeah, the pool!
 Uh, eight feet.
 Oh, man. You guys jackknife off this diving board all the time or what? Oh, I used to be so good at those. You mind if I get in? Um- Yeah, we- we have a lot of stuff to do today. So- Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, errands are very important, but really, the most important thing right now is for me to stay relaxed, if you don't want my tubes to get all tensed up. So, you want to go grab a swimsuit for me to borrow, or should I just jump in in my birthday gear? No. Don't do that. We'll- Honey, do we have a suit that she can borrow? Sure. I'll go get you that suit. [Sean] Okay. Good girl. All right, Charlie. We are gonna be gentlemen. Yup. We have the law on our side. We just show them the deed. Mm-hmm. And then they vacate the premises. Mm-hmm. And that's it. No reason to be animals about it. And they changed the locks. Yes, they did. You were right, Frank! They changed the locks, bud. I'm telling you, these people, they're uncivilized deadbeats. Let's smash the door down. All right, ready? Here we go. [Together] And a-one, and a-two, and a-three [Shouting]
 [Groans]
 [Charlie] Oh, that- that was a bummer. Man. I gotta admit, that's, uh That felt very unsatisfying to me.
 [Frank] Yeah, I didn't like that.
 Should you guys, um No. Try smashing it from the inside?
 Let's just give it another shot. And-
 [Charlie] Oh!
 [Charlie] Give it another one.
 Kick it.
 Nice, dude!
 My door! My door, deadbeat! My door! And what's this shyster lawyer doing here? Well, it is just so nice to see you again, Mr. Reynolds. I see that you're still just horrible. Yes, you're horrible too. And I hate your tie. Hey. All right. You know what? This family behind me- Yeah. Has 90 days to vacate. Deadbeats. Until then, you can't touch them. That's bull bird, man. What do you got there? Let me handle this, Frank. It's not bull bird. I'll tell you that right now. He's making a few good points. Look, buddy. Crap. I know a lot about the law and various other lawyerings. I'm well educated, well versed. I know that situations like this, real-estate wise, they're very complex. Actually, they're pretty simple. The forms are all standard boilerplate. Okay. We're all hungry. We're gonna get to our hot plates soon enough. All right? Well, let's talk about the contract here I'm sorry. I forgot. Where did you go to law school again? Uh, well, I could ask you that very same question. I went to Harvard. Ah. Mm-hmm. How 'bout you? Where? Yeah? Hmm? I'm pleading the Fifth, sir. I'd advise that you do that. I'll take that advice into cooperation. All right? Let's say you and I go toe-to-toe on bird law and see who comes out the victor. You know, I don't think I'm gonna do anything close to that, and I can see clearly you know nothing about the law. It seems like you have a tenuous grasp on the English language in general. Okay. Well- Filibuster. Uh- Do you- Do you know what that word means? Yup! Yeah, what's that mean? [Sighs]
 [Screams]
 [Door Shattering] I-I'm gonna- We're gonna- [Groans] [Frank] No, no, no. Now I'm all churned up about this. I can't wait 90 days to get rid of those people. I mean, I gotta sell that house. Frank, don't be rash. It's just 90 days. No. In 90 days, there's gonna be shit all over those walls. [Scoffs] Those people are gonna trash that house. We won't be able to get a dime for it. I am calling a Realtor right now. Oh, wait, Frank. Hold on a second. [Phone Beeps] Maybe we could sell the house ourselves, you know? Save the five percent. What do Realtors do anyway? They pop on a blazer. They walk people through a house. We can do that. Mac, the real estate business is something that takes a lot of style and a lot of finesse, and that's something that the two of us both have in spades. Absolutely. I'm thinking we do like a classic good Realtor-bad Realtor dynamic. Oh, shit. I'm the good, you're the bad? You're the sweet to my sour. The honey to your vinegar? That's good, dude!
 Honey and Vinegar Realty.
 I like that. I like the Honey and Vinegar. I like what I'm hearing, boys. Okay! I knew that guy was full of shit! I knew it! What guy? That lawyer guy. Okay? He totally besmirched me today, and I demand satisfaction from him. You want him to bang you? Uh No, Mac. Be serious, okay? He slandered me in front of a jury of my own peers. All right? Look what they used to do when that sort of thing happened. Take a look at this picture.
 What do you see?
 I see two trannies shooting at each other. No, dude. They're dueling, okay? These are lawyers settling an argument by dueling it out. Now, how do you know that the two trannies are lawyers? 'Cause it's an old book, okay? I don't have to explain everything to you about what I know! I'm trying to get satisfied from this dude, and you're trying to I'm getting satisfied. I don't care.
 What are you doing, Deandra?
 Collecting the money you bitches owe me. I'm going on maternity leave. What are you jabbering about now? I got a sweet setup going on as a surrogate for a couple of rich yuppies. They have a huge house, kick-ass pool. I'm living the high life. So suck on that, white stains. Oh, dude! I knew we should've done the baby thing. Now there's a pool involved? When was the last time you swam in a pool? I want to swim in the pool!
 It's been like forever since I swam in a pool.
 No, no! Now, let's focus here. We gotta sell this house. And then we can go swim in Deandra's pool. Hey, Vic. You got that other snack tray? I certainly do, Hugh. Certainly do. Okay, great. People are gonna be here any second. I want them to be well fed. The house looks nice. The house looks nice. It does look nice. Hey, hey, hey! You jerks aren't supposed to be here when my mom and dad are at work! Your mom and dad aren't at work. That's why they lost the house. They're probably at the dog track getting wasted. Dude, eat my boogers. You eat my boogers! Whoa, whoa! Hey, Vic, Vic. Whoa. Smell that vinegar boiling up inside you. But I need you to save some of it for the customer. Do that for me, okay, baby boy? What the hell's going on out here?
 Frank, can you get these kids out of here?
 Yeah. Come on. We're gonna go paint your room a color that's not stupid. Then we're gonna throw your toys in the trash! Listen, I need you on my team. You on my team? Yeah. I'm- I'm on your team. All right, great. Yeah? Yeah. I just- He gets me- That's good. [Knocking] Oh! Here we go.
 Hi! How are ya?
 How you doing? We're here to look at the house. Of course. Yeah, come on in. Hi. I'm Hugh Honey. How you doing? Good. This is my associate, Vic Vinegar. Hi. Tad. And we are here to show you this house. Okay. Oh! Good. Okay. [Chuckles] Come on in. Great. Hi. Okay. Good. All right. This is the living room. Okay! Wonderful. Now, what do you folks think? It's a beautiful house, right? Well, you know, I'm thinking this might be a bit large for what we need.
 Oh, I'm sorry, buddy. Is this house too big for you?
 Now, Vic. Just a second, Hugh. Why don't you ask your wife what she needs, pal? Oh, I'm sorry. Is she used to something smaller, and you don't think she can handle it? Okay, I think we're gonna get going. It's okay, you guys. I'm here. I want this to be a good experience for you. Okay? I'll tell you what, buddy. How 'bout I take your wife upstairs and show her what it's like to be deep inside a really big house? What? What? What? Uh, you'll have to excuse my associate. It's just his passion for quality real estate that makes him so intense. Now, what can we do to put you in this house? I think we're just gonna go now. Yeah. Are you gonna buy the house? [Woman] We're gonna go. Are you going to buy this house? We don't want any trouble. Are you going to buy this house? I don't know! I don't know! Are you going to buy this house? Yes! Yes! "Yes" what? Yes, I will buy this house! That's it. There we go. That's all I wanted to hear. Congratulations, folks. You just bought a brand-new house. Can we go? Yeah! Go, honey. Go. Congratulations. I'm going! Just go! All right. We'll be in touch. Oh! That was amazing, bro! You think that's gonna work? Bro, it already did work. You heard the skirt. She said, "Yes, I will buy this house." That is a binding verbal contract. Now, I heard it. You heard it. And that pussy husband of hers heard it too. If they back out now, I will find them, I will strangle them, I will beat them into oblivion! Wow! Wow! I'm full of the vinegar.
 Oh. Yeah!
 Hey. How'd it go? Sold it! Sold the house. Sold it? Fantastic! Let's get another house, flip it over, make some cash. It's not really the cash that I care about anymore. It's the thrill of the sale that I'm responding to.
 You're driven by the thrill of the sale.
 You know what I'm thinking? Maybe it's time to merge the two ideas after all.
 Baby in the house?
 Baby in the house. [Chuckling] Honey and Vinegar? Okay. Jesus Christ. All right. I'll get on it. Mmm. Well, well, well, well, well! If it isn't the big-time, hotshot lawyer man. Oh, my God. I do not have time for you. Yeah, so we both have busy schedules, so I'll make this quick. I shan't mince words with you for long. I am challenging you, sir, to a duel.
 I accept.
 Uh [Pen Tapping On Desk] [Chuckles] Are you serious? Yeah. I accept your challenge. Do you want time to think it over? No! No. No, not at all. Um, what time were you thinking of dueling? [Exhales] Any time is good, really. I don't have You don't have time 'cause you would have to go out and get a proper gun. Oh. No, no, no. I have a gun. I actually keep one right here in the drawer. You got one right there? I don't need to see it. I like to keep it loaded because you never know who's gonna walk into a law office these days. [Laughing] Safety first.
 Right.
 So let's rethink some things. [Clears Throat] Let's say that you've learned your lesson now, and I've learned a little lesson. Hmm. And we'll call it even, and I will respectfully decline the duel.
 Well, you can't decline.
 Eh? As you know, once the duel's been accepted, you know, there's no backing out. I mean, that's the law. Yup. Anyway, great! This is settled. And I was looking for something to do tomorrow afternoon anyway. So I'm gonna pencil you in for high noon tomorrow. Don't do it.
 Don't do it.
 And, uh, don't worry 'cause, um, wherever you are, I'll find you.
 Yeah.
 I'm gonna put one right between your teeth. And it's just gonna pop out the back of your neck. [Clicks Tongue] Hey, Deandra? Can we talk to you for a sec? Hey, you guys. Watch me bust out this sweet jackknife.
 Oh! Whoa!
 [Gasps, Coughing]
 [Laughing] You guys!
 Are you okay?
 Oh, I biffed that one, huh?
 You "biffed" it? Whoo! Thank God there wasn't a baby in there, huh? Could you get me a refill on that, guy? What is this? Piña colada. Been crushing them. They're great in the heat. Ah. I don't think you should be drinking and swimming.
 No.
 Dingdong! Hello. [Dee] Goddamn it. Hello!
 Hi.
 No, no, no, no, no. We're looking for Deandra Reynolds. Oh, there she is. Wait, wait. Don't do that. We're the wealthy homosexual couple she promised her womb to. Indeed, we are. I'm Hugh Honey, and this is my partner, Vic Vinegar. We're partners in real estate, and we're partners in life. [Dee Laughing] Oh, hi! Oh, hey! Oh, you guys! How are you doing, sweetie? Oh, excuse us for just one second. Oh, boy. It's good to see you. What the hell are you guys doing here? Do not ruin this for me! Dee, relax. Okay? We're gonna start a bidding war, drive up the price of your womb. Why would I want you to drive up the price of my womb? If we make this couple desperate enough for money, they'll sell their house to us. We're buying every house in the neighborhood. Yeah, check it out. We get the house, you get a higher price for that kid you're crapping out. Everybody wins. We're merging the ideas. I didn't want to merge the ideas in the first place. Well, we're merging 'em, so get used to it. Uh, we're giving Deandra $100,000 to carry a child for us. Now, I'll be providing the sperm, of course. And I'll be providing the money because I'm the breadwinner in the relationship. And I'm the trophy husband. He's my bottom. Oh! I'm the power bottom. Technically, I generate most of the power. Only because I'm giving out so much power from the top. You need to generate power to accept it.
 Deandra, what the hell are they talking about?
 I don't know. Hey, Dee! Hey! Hey! [Sean] Who's this guy? Oh, splinter! There's a gate, bro! What the hell are you doing here? Pardon me, ma'am, sir.
 Everything's fine 'cause Daddy's here now.
 Who are you? I'm the father of the baby growing inside of her stomach, and I need a safe place to hide. What baby are you talking about, Charlie? I'm not pregnant yet!
 [Crashing]
 Abort! [Grunts] Abort! Abort!
 Do not buy this house!
 There's a goddamn gate! I just got done with that lawyer. He threatened to sue me.
 What? Why?
 Well, I had those kids painting their room. And then I told them to go down, rip some copper pipes out. Their little hands got all bloody. Big deal. And they- I had to give them the house to settle the suit. Okay, that's it. You all are crazy, and I'm asking you to leave. [Dee] Yes. So, let's go. Please leave. Oh, are you sure? Really?
 This is a very inviting pool.
 You heard the guy! You heard him! Oh, you two. I am so sorry about that. Boy, that was nuts, wasn't it? Yeah. You know, we're gonna have to ask you to leave as well. But what about the baby? We're just gonna find someone else. Oh, you guys! You got me there! I thought you were serious. We are serious, Deandra. [Splashing] Oh, this shit is like a bathtub. [Mac] Jackknife! Oh, yeah! Cannonball! Whoo! [Mac] Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
 Oh, yeah!
 This is great. Come on in, Dee. Chicken fight! Chicken fight!
 [Dennis] Let's do a chicken fight!
 Chicken fight! Chicken fight! Chicken fight! Chicken fight! Chicken fight! [Shouting] [Screaming] Yeah! Yeah! [Voices Speaking Backwards]                        [Tool Clicking] [Frank] You gotta be careful of the wire, Charlie. [Charlie] I'm not gonna pinch the wire. I know what I'm doing. 'Cause then the brake lights don't work. I know what I'm doing. Make sure it's on tight. It's on as tight as it's gonna get! Okay. All right. It's on good and tight. Hey, Dennis, I think we should get, like, a G.P.S. System, 'cause these maps are from, like, the '70s, dude. G.P.S. System? Oh, hell, no! No? That's gonna ruin the road trip experience. We gotta go do this old school, baby. Maps, fresh cigarettes, fresh coffee, cooking out on the grill, sleeping in sleeping bags. Old school. Old school, baby! I'm into that! Campfire. Let's do old school! Old school, yeah! Oh, shit. [Horn Honks]
 Oh, shit.
 Who is that? That Sweet Dee? That's Dee. That's Sweet Dee. Oh, goddamn it. What is that car? What is she doing here? [Charlie] What car is that? Ah, shit. Okay, don't- don't- Just don't say anything. Hey, guys. What's with the trailer? [Mac] Hey. None of your business. What are you doing here so early?
 Why are you at work early?
 I woke up early this morning and went and bought a new car. It's pretty sweet. Where you guys going?
 We're going to the Grand Canyon.
 Goddamn it, Frank!
 Really?
 Frank wants to see it before he dies, so Yeah, what happened was he told us about a road trip. We got all excited. We got up super early and we packed the car
 and were hoping to get out of here before your bus arrived.
 You were just gonna ditch me? Nah, it's cool. I'm gonna stick around. Yeah. Charlie's too scared. Yeah. He's never left Philly before. I'm not scared! I just haven't left Philly. Why leave Philly, you know? He's frightened.
 I want to go.
 No, you're not going. You can't come 'cause it'll take forever. Yeah, and you're gonna have to pee every five minutes. It's gonna be stupid. I'm not gonna get stuck behind with Charlie. Wait a second! If you go, I'm gonna be all by myself in the bar. That's messed up, guys. I mean, that's more change than, like, even if I went.
 You know what? Maybe I should go.
 Great. We're all in. It's gonna be packed in the car! No, we're not all in.
 Yeah, we're going.
 We're going on a road trip, baby! Why did you have to buy a new car today of all days? I'll go get my stuff. [Dee] I can't believe you've never been out of Philly, Charlie. Yeah, man. What the hell? I've never done a lot of things. What else have you not done, bro? Uh, I've never eaten a pear. What? How is that possible? Seriously. Really? Pears weird me out, dude. Where do you start with a pear? The top, the bottom? What do you mean, where do you start? Just bite into it. It's a fruit. You just start it. Really? You just bite it? It's a weird-looking thing. Okay, you know what? Pull over. I'm getting this kid a pear. No, no. No pulling over! We've got a schedule. Yeah, no, no. I would love to take a quick leak. Are you serious? Oh, Deandra! We just left! That's what I was worried about. And it can't just be any pear, dude. It's gotta be a fresh one. Let's go to the Italian market. Oh, okay. Hey-oh! The Italian market is way out of our way. Nah. Dennis, do you have to smoke? It's coming right back in through my window. Roll your window up then, Dee, 'cause I'm a-smoking. The window needs to be down for the fresh air. Hey, I've never had blueberries either. What? What are you talking about? That's crazy! That is completely insane. We're definitely going to the Italian market. Dennis, let's go. You believe this guy? Jesus!
 What guy?
 Guy on the bike. He's taking up the whole goddamn road. Ride on the sidewalk if you're gonna ride a bike, asshole! [Honking] What was that? He flicked you off, dude. Is that what that was? He flicked you off, man. Son of a bitch. Real chip on his shoulder, huh? You wanna egg him? Yeah, I wanna egg him. You got eggs? No. That would have been good though. That would've been good, man. You know what? I'm gonna fire a beer across his bow. Ruffle his feathers. Yeah, give him a good scare? Yeah, man. [Dee] Yeah. Jerk. Get up real close to him. Hey, asshole. Ooh! Oh, shit! [All] Oh! Shit! I hit him! I hit him! You hit him in the back of the head! I didn't mean to.
 That is not how I expected that to go at all.
 Is he okay?
 Did we kill him?
 I don't know. Oh, he's getting up. [Frank] He's moving, he's moving. [Mac] Yeah, he's getting up. Thank God, dude. God. Should we help him out? [Mac] And he's getting something out of his bag. [Dennis] What's he getting? It's a pipe. It's a pipe? Go, go, go, go, go!
 [Dee] Go, go, go, go!
 [All Shouting At Once] What's wrong with your tires? The car's scraping. [Charlie] All right, get back to the bar. Get back to the bar. Damn it! Goddamn it! Shit! These tires are completely destroyed. Ah, shit! I'm just gonna pop inside real quick, take a quick squirt. Unbelievable. How about we put a couple of doughnuts on there? Oh, right, Frank. We're gonna go to the Grand Canyon on spare tires. Uh, plus there's a good deal of mountain bike in your axle here, bro. [Dennis] Seriously, dude? Yeah. We're talking structural damage down there. There's leakage. Things are sparking. All right. Well, road trip's off. No, no, no, no, no. Road trip's not off. I have a good idea. Not bad, right? Nah. It's kinda nice. Lot of leg room. It's a smooth ride. You guys got a lot of room back there? Oh, yeah. We got easy access to the beers too. I mean, that's a good touch. New car smell. Mmm. How do you get that in a used car? What is that? It's a spray. Yeah, it's a spray. Oh, yeah. It's nice. I enjoy it, man. I'm glad that they did that. It's nice. I wish that this light would hurry up and change. That's the only thing. Uh-oh!
 Hey! Hey, you bastards!
 [All Groan] You jerks! Hey! Hey! [Dennis] Ah, here we go. Goddamn it! Get out! [Charlie] All right. All right, all right, all right. It's my car. I'm driving. Get out! I got window! Get out! [Charlie] You call window, Frank? You jerks! I got window. [Dee] You guys are dicks. It took you long enough. You were taking forever! Did you still want to go? Shut up! It's really cramped back here with this cooler. Why don't you put the cooler in the trailer? Because then, Dee, we're gonna have to pull over every single time we want a beer. That new car smell is starting to give me a headache. Dennis, give me a cigarette. You want a cigarette? Yeah. I'm gonna have one too. Do you guys have to smoke in here? Yeah- Well, your car reeks, Dee, so- [Blows Raspberry] God, dude, this thing is so heavy! I'm gonna get a blood clot with this thing! Oh, my God! Why don't you put it in the trailer? Why don't I put you in the trailer? Good one, Charlie. That's actually not a bad idea. I wouldn't mind riding back there. There's a hell of a lot more room. I'm done with that. [Both Exclaim] [Dee] Oh, come on! Oh, it's in my- Get it! You're gonna burn a hole in the new upholstery! It's not new upholstery. What makes you think it's new upholstery? Did you get it? Oh, yeah! This sucks! Deandra, pull over. This is terrible. I wanna go in the back with Dennis. Yeah. You guys ride in back, and we'll- Yeah. We'll go in the back. Mmm. This is more like it, huh, Frank? Got a lot of room back here. It's muggy back here. Muggy. My glands are starting to swell up. Yeah. Well, maybe we crack that door a little bit. What? And go flying out at the first corner? I don't think so, buddy. Well, just to crack it- just a little bit.
 You want to crack it?
 Yeah, we'll crack it.
 Crack it.
 Whoa. It's hard to stand up back here. Furniture is what we need. We'll pick some up at the Italian market. When's the last time you saw furniture in an Italian market? Those people will sell you anything. They'll sell you their children. They don't care.
 Provolone and salami.
 They sell everything at the Italian market. These people are like descendants of Gypsies. They come in. They sell their shit. They bang each other. I don't know what they do, but you get to haggle with them. It's a lot of fun.
 In the meantime, I'll prop this beer bottle under the door.
 All right. That's good. [Groans] Yeah. Uh- There we go. Perfect. Now, the weight of the door will keep the beer bottle in place. Good. Nice, huh? Move over a little bit. Let me sit on the cooler. Goddamn it! All right, now this I can get into. You know? A little space back here. You guys want to listen to some tunes? Got some CDs from Dennis here. Hate to break it to you, but there's no CD player in here. Are you shitting me? No. Why would you buy a car with no CD player? Because the guy knocked 50 bucks off. So you had the option? Yeah, I had the option! Oh, my God! And you went with the tape deck? Yes, I did, Charlie! That is so cheap, Dee! You're cheap! Why did you buy this crappy little car in the first place? Because you guys rammed my last one into a wall! That's why. Whatever. What tapes do you have? Tapes? Who has tapes anymore? I would've thought that you would've at least made a mix for the road trip. You didn't invite me on your road trip! You don't keep a good mix tape in your car? I just bought the car this morning, Charlie! Okay! All right! Are you going to yell the whole way there, Dee? Jesus Christ. Just shut up and turn the radio on. Yeah, put the radio on. Just turn the radio on! [Radio: Tuning] Find a station. I'm trying. The antenna is probably broken on this piece of shit car! It's static. Find a station. You're a piece of shit car. Wait a second. There's a tape right down here, I think. You got a tape? Yeah, it's under the seat. Give it to me. Gimme. It's jammed in the corner of the seat. Give it to me. I'm trying to give it- Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, There we go. Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme Calm down, dude. [Cassette Clicks]  [New Age] [Man's Voice] Inner peace Oh, man. Is an attainable goal. The first step is releasing the anger and aggression that one holds inside. Pop it out, right? Yeah. Quickly. All right, I'm gonna run to the ladies' room for two seconds. I'm gonna take my keys in case you jerks try anything. Really? All right, Charlie. Get ready to scratch two things off of your bucket list. Oh, I don't have a bucket list, dude, 'cause I'm not dying. Everybody's dying, bitch. Let's get you some fruit. Guys, we're gonna go grab some furniture to throw in the back. Ten minutes. That's all. And we meet back here. Well, yeah. But get a good deal. I mean, talk to the guy. Barter. There's no rush, right? Ten. Ten minutes. Have fun, man. Have fun. Uh, I've never had a strawberry either. That's astounding. Oh, Charlie, I'm excited for you, bro. Hey! Pears. Nice! Yes. One of nature's most delectable fruits. Mmm. Mm-hmm. Excuse me, sir. How much for this? Those are 50 cents. Well, I won't pay full price. So I'll give you a dime. They're 50 cents, buddy. Very well. I'll drop you a quarter. No. Okay. Thirty-five cents. I don't have time for this friggin' shit. Give me the 35. Hey, yeah! Nice, man. I talked you down. Good barter. There you go. Good barter. All right, Bozo. Thank you. I'm calling a lot of people Bozo now. It's like my new thing. Dude. Chomp into it. Yeah. Just bite it? Okay. Like a piece of fruit. You would bite into it [Groans] Tastes like sand. Like sand? Oh, that- that pear's not ripe, dude. Ah. He burned us. Gypsy son of a bitch burned us. Excuse me, sir? What are you doing to my friend, Bozo? You burned us. It's dry. You picked it out. Well, let's not get into a whole "who picked out what. " I want my 35 cents back.
 Charlie, give him the pear.
 I can't. I just ate it. The whole thing? Yeah. It was pretty gross. The stem and then- and the core? You didn't tell me not to eat the stem, dude! Did you eat the stickers that are all over it? Yeah, it was gross! Of course it's gross! It's a sticker, bro! I eat stickers all the time, dude! Oh, my God. This whole thing is a disaster. I'm going back to the car. Come on. Let's go. I don't know. They got a lot of good stuff here. I like the rocking chair. Very nice. But I do like those wicker chairs. They might be more forgiving on my bottom. Good. It's a tough decision though. I don't know. Well, make one, Den. Make one, please. Make a decision? Um, sir? Hi. We're interested in these wicker chairs, but we're totally unwilling to pay full price for them, so You're gonna barter with the guy? Yeah. We're not gonna barter with him. We're not bartering. We'll pay full price. Get the wicker chairs. No, no, no, no, no. Frank. Come on. The Gypsy wants to barter. Let's barter with him. We don't have time to barter. All right. We'll pay full price for Whoa. Is that a French press? Sir, how much for that fine-looking French press? We don't need a French press, Dennis. What, do you expect me to drink gas station coffee all the way to the Grand Canyon? I don't think so, asshole. Sir, the man will pay full price for the French press, or I will, however, be willing to barter with you for a very long time.
 Full price.
 Great! Hey, you guys seen anybody selling cassette tapes? Deandra, what the hell are you doing? What are you drinking? It's an energy drink. You guys are drinking beer. I gotta tweak on something. You're gonna be pissing every 15 feet. Nah! I know what I'm doing. I'm buying you a piss jar. Ooh! Hold on a second. I think I see some tapes down there. I'm gonna go barter with that guy. Barter with the Gypsy. Dude, I'm telling you, it's black to yellow. And no one ever uses Black to yellow? No, dude. It's blue to something. You never let me do this, okay? And hurry up, man. It's blue to something. Just use the black to yellow, and the car will start. Oh, shit! You guys, check it out. I found this Soul Asylum tape, and I totally talked the guy down to, like, half the asking price. Yeah. Oh, goddamn it! Yeah. There was a bunch of wires hanging down, and I was trying to put them back up into- Shut up! Just shut up! Here's your piss jar. Yo, Frank, I'm gonna hop in the back with Dennis. You want to switch with me? Switch-ola? They're gonna argue the whole way. I don't wanna listen to it. No, I don't like it in there anyway. All right.
 Hey, you want a cup of joe, my man?
 Oh, yeah, definitely, dude. I got a pipin'-hot one ready for you right now. Hook me up, bro. Hook me up! All right. [Laughs] That's a pretty sweet duct tape rig you got going on the door, man. [Dennis] You like that? Taped the chairs down too, so they don't slide any. I know, but you stopped at the grill, and that's got me confused.
 Ran out of tape actually.
 Oh, right. It's not gonna slide through the crack? It won't because I measured the crack, and the crack is smaller than the height of the grill.
 We are all hooked up here, dude.
 Mmm. Now, are you nervous at all about leaving Philly? Like, is anything bad gonna happen? [Chuckles] I don't think so, man. I'm excited about it. I've just never been outside of Philly. I don't know what people are like.
 Well, people are people.
 Nobody's gonna be, like, a dick? There are probably gonna be some dicks out there. Yeah, sure. But I'll be there. I'll back you up, man. Hey, thanks, man. I tell you what will help. Shotgun a beer? That'll calm my nerves. It sure will. Let's do that. [Mac] I'm bored. [Dee] Yeah. Let's play a drinking game. Name all 50 states. Drink while you think. That's gonna suck. I'm not drinking. Frank, will you drive for a little bit? I've been drinking all day. [Mutters] Fine. Uh, go. Maine. Uh, New Hampshire. Vermont. Philly. North Virginia. South Virginia. East Virginia. Uh, South Virginia. Did I say that already? Yes. Are you guys shitting me? Shit. All right. Start over. No, I'm not gonna start over. I was right. The game sucks. It's the drinking that's the amusing part. I got an idea. Georgia. That's six. Oh. I was gonna- No. [Laughs] Jesus Christ. You guys are gonna be hammered before I'm finished naming the East Coast. Bro, I gotta cook up some hot dogs, man. All right. I got a proposition for you, man. Check this out. What do you say we smash these wicker chairs to bits, put them in the middle of the U-Haul- which is metal and we burn the wicker chairs and cook the hot dogs on that? What do you mean? Cook the hot dogs over the fire? And then we'll get some new wicker chairs next time we're at a Gypsy hangout spot. Okay. You think we're gonna be going to a lot of those? 'Cause I feel like I already dodged a bullet once today. What do you mean? Well, I mean, you know, Gypsies- I don't want anyone shrinking my head and shit. Yeah. Yeah. Well, first of all, it was not Gypsies ever that did that. That's sort of a witch doctor thing. But either way, neither one of them can shrink heads. Let's burn the chairs. All right. A couple hot dogs will calm me down. Thanks for driving. I really appreciate the ride. Yeah. [Slurring] So you're headed to Hollywood, huh? Yeah. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. You're running away from home, aren't you? Um, yeah, maybe. Kinda. Oh, no, no, no. Sweet baby, they are gonna eat you alive in Hollywood. [Gasps] Oh, you're definitely gonna end up doing gay porn with this tiny little body of yours. No. Oh, man, kid. I'll be fine. I've actually got an uncle out there that's Shh. I got something you need to hear about. Hold on a second. [Cassette Clicks] [Soul Asylum] # Just easier than dealin' with the pain # [With Cassette] # Runaway train never comin' back #  Wrong way on a one-way track . Right. I've actually got this uncle out there that said that  Seems like I'm neither here nor there   Runaway train tearin' up the- the track   Runaway train tearin' up the track   [Continues] [Slurring] Shit. [Gasps] What is that? Is that piss? Is that piss? Pull over! You might as well pull over. He's just gonna keep yelling. Pull over, you little dick! [Groans] Stop the car! Piss! You know what? Jesus Christ, Dee! I'm covered in piss! Well, maybe you shouldn't have had your window down! Maybe you shouldn't be throwing jars of pee out the window! Maybe I should, maybe I shouldn't. It's up for debate. You shouldn't! Hey, what the hell is that? [Mac Coughs, Spits] Oh! Oh! Oh. [Coughing] Holy shit! Damn. It's dark, and we haven't even left Philly yet. [Coughing] I'm so sorry, dude. I don't know what happened, man. It's like, we lit the chairs, and there must've been a glaze on the wicker or something. Yeah. 'Cause, like, we passed out instantly.
 Some sort of a poison glaze.
 What are we, 20 minutes away from the bar? Yeah, we're close. I use this gas station all the time. Sorry. Took a little longer than I thought. There was a line for the bathroom. Hey-oh! Check out this couch I found by the Dumpster. Toss it in. Nice. Got it, buddy. Wait. What's the plan here? You guys are still gonna ride in the back? Oh, yeah. I sure as shit am, dude. You're not gonna get the smell of piss out of that car for weeks. Yeah, it's pretty bad. I'm in. Me too. You guys getting in too? All right, let's do it. All right, whatever. [Coughing] Have fun in the death trap! I guess I'm riding with you, bro. Hey, you're not gonna sing to me, are you? I might. [Sighs] All right. Hey, you know, Dee, I didn't want to say anything back there, 'cause I didn't want to be rude to the kid, but you really gotta be careful just picking up hitchhikers. I know. But that kid was, like, really young and sweet and innocent-looking. Right. But those are the ones you gotta watch out for. Those are the most dangerous hitchhikers the ones that lure you into thinking they're sane by acting like normal people. They act like they're normal and then they carve you up. No way. Wasn't gonna happen. I had my eyes on him the whole time. See, I've always got an "A," "B" and a "C" strike plan to get us out of any potentially life-threatening situation. Yeah. He probably just carved up his mother and father, and he's running away on the road. That's right. Could be, Frank. All I'm saying is that I'm ready for any situation.
 And that's why you're all safe as long as I'm around.
 Uh-huh. Yeah. I did an ocular pat-down and I cleared him. Say what? I'm sorry? I'm saying that I did an ocular assessment of the situation, garnered that he was not a security risk, and I cleared him for passage. [Chuckling] "Ocular pat-down"! What in the hell are you talking about? I'm talking about breaking down the security situation, clearing an individual and making it safe for passage. Well, how exactly do you view yourself within the context of our group? The sheriff of Paddy's. Well, I can't have this conversation right now. The sheriff of Paddy's? Can you move? I want to unfold this thing. I'm gonna pass out. Got a long trip ahead of us. Careful. [Frank] I got it. [Frank] I got it. [Birds Chirping] [Frank Snoring, Muttering] [Muttering Continues] [Grumbles] Aah! Aah! Get off me, dude! Are we moving? I think we're stopped. Dee, what time is it? What? Hmm? Shit, we've been driving all night. We're not moving, are we? No. Whoa. Shit. You think we're, like, halfway there? Where do you think we are? I wonder how far we got. [Mac] I wonder if we're like What the hell is this? [Frank Groans]
 Oh, are we back at Paddy's?
 Wait. Where the hell is my car? Oh, goddamn! Shit balls! What's going on? [Gasps] [Yawns] Hey, you guys are back!
 How was the Grand Canyon?
 What the hell happened to my car, Charlie? I don't know. Last thing I remember, uh, we were at the gas station. And then you guys hopped in back, and I hopped in front with the hitchhiker. Then I got freaked out about leaving Philly, so I asked him if he'd drop me off back here. And he said he'd take you guys to the Grand Canyon, and then I drank all night and passed out. And then you guys were getting here now, so I figured- Did you go and come back? He didn't take us to the Grand Canyon. He detached the trailer and stole my car! Really? Yeah! The weird thing is that Mac had already cleared him as a security risk. Did an ocular pat-down on him. Amazing, right?
 You cleared him, Mac?
 I cleared him. Goddamn it! I thought he was clear! He wasn't clear! I'm calling the cops. He was clear. I thought Mac cleared him. I didn't think there'd be a problem. I don't know how- I kinda had a good time on the trip. Looking on the bright side of things. All right? Let's drink some beers, man. I'm hungover as shit. Absolutely, man.
 Little hair of the dog.
 That was the closest I ever got to being out of Philly, man. All right, cheers. Cheers, you guys. Texas. Oops. State game? Ohio. Rhode Island. Nice. Uh, Detroit. Nope. That's not a state. Drink. Milwaukee! Jesus H. Christ. [Voices Speaking Backwards]                       [Mac] Well, this is an interesting development. [Dennis] This is not good. [Charlie] You think maybe he's just vacationing? No. Charlie, there's blocks in front and in back of his tires. He's not going anywhere. Yeah. This guy's planted himself here. And I tell you what, once all the other R. V. Folks see what this R.V. guy is doing, they're gonna start parking their R. V.'s on our street. Shit. We're gonna be staring down the barrel of a shantytown situation. Oh, my God. Who just takes their vehicle and parks in someone's, you know, street and says, "This is my street. I'm gonna live here now 'cause I'm poor"? I'll tell you who. New poor. What? Ever since the recession hit, waves of new people are suddenly broke. These people have no idea how to live without money. They're what's called "new poor." We're old poor. Yeah, they could stand to learn a lesson or two from us, because we would never take our homelessness and shove it down everybody's face. Have some class if you're gonna be poor! All right. Let's get this guy out of here, send him a message. Let's do it. Right. Let's slash his tires. Well, not that though, because then he can't leave. That doesn't make any sense. Well, you start putting plans under microscopes, nothing's gonna make sense, all right? Lots of things make sense. Slashing someone's tires so that they leave makes no sense. You gonna put everything I say under a microscope, bud? It's a stupid idea, Charlie. I'm sorry. You have a better plan? Dee! Sharpest item in the bar! I need it now! Let's go! Whoa. What the hell's going on over here? [Dee] Oh, Frank's trying to kill himself. Is he all right? Frank, are you all right? Don't try to stop me. Oh, my God.
 Oh, so he's alive.
 I lost all my money in a Ponzi scheme, Charlie. I'm broke! His neck is so thick, I feel like he's just gonna swing and dangle around for a really long time. That's what it is! Let's cut him down. Frank, it's not gonna work for you. Your neck's too thick, buddy.
 Tie a chair to me.
 Times are tough, huh? Shit. This is terrible. What? What are you talking about? What is terrible? If you're looking for a better steak in an arcade setting, you are shit out of luck. I'm talking about eating out all the time. It's a business expense, Frank. It's only fair that the upper management of the bar get together to talk shop over top-notch steak and some video games. You two have no idea how serious this is. I can't bail you out anymore! Maybe we should take this time to streamline Paddy's, make it run as efficiently as the government. [Dennis] Mmm! Yeah. Cut out the steak dinners. We're not cutting out the steak dinners, so just hold your horses on that one. If anything, we should be talking about bonuses. Let's talk bonuses. Good idea. Bonuses? [Dennis] Yeah! You run the business into the ground, and you want bonuses? Frank, don't be a moron. You start cutting bonuses, you're gonna lose your top guys. You gotta separate the wheat from the chaff somehow. Yeah. These dudes are all chaff. Right? Yeah- Well, no. We're all wheat. No, we're chaff. No, we're not. We're- We're wheat. Why would you want to be wheat? Why would you ever want to be chaff? Well, who wants to be- Okay, I'll be chaff, you be wheat. You two idiots have no business sense whatsoever! We have no business sense? He's the one dangling from a noose 10 minutes ago. [Laughs] That's a good point. Let's start streamlining right now. Frank, you're out. You're fired. Oh! You just got squeezed out, bitch! Oh, I'm squeezed out? Uh-huh. Well, let's see how far you two idiots get without Frank Reynolds bailing you out every five minutes!
 I'm outta here!
 I'm comfortable being chaff if you want to be wheat. [Dennis] Okay, man, whatever. [Grunts] [Dee] You're firing us? Well, first we're gonna give you the opportunity to defend your jobs.
 Really?
 Yeah. All right. I appreciate the opportunity, fellas.
 I'm on it! Whoo!
 Good. Show us what you do around here, Charlie.
 Hoo-woo-woo-woo!
 Oh, come on! This is bullshit! I shouldn't have to defend my job to you! Dee, we don't know what it is that you do around here. You don't seem to do anything. Me? Come on! I do a shitload! Why don't you make us a drink? Fine. I'll crack you open a beer. No, no, no. Not a beer. Something you have to mix. But this bottle is cold-activated. I mean, look at it. Doesn't that look delicious? It does look delicious, but mix me a drink. But the mountains, they've turned blue. Mojito me, please. A refreshing mojito would do. Nobody orders a mojito in this bar. So you can't make a mojito? Of course I can make a mojito! Then make one. Fine! One mojito coming up, gentlemen. [Chuckling] I quit. Goddamn it! Shit! I was really looking forward to firing her. Me too. Okay, boys, let's talk rat traps, okay? Huh? I need money. Huh? The guys were being total knobs, so I quit. Also, you're really behind on my rent and they're threatening to evict me, so money. What part of "I am broke" don't you guys understand? I tried to hang myself. No more bailouts! Well, what am I supposed to do? Not my problemo. What's with the briefcase? I'm gonna start a new business. I created an empire before, and I can do it again. Huh. You are really good at making money. Okay, I'm in. What are you talking about? What value are you to me? I'm desperate, so I'll do anything. Okay, that's good. Are you willing to destroy your credit? It's never really been a problem before. That's good. Hold that. We're gonna take out a big loan in your name and get an office. Great. Okay, let's go. All right, that's the rainwater barrels. Now let's talk about the trash. What do I do with the trash? How do I dispose of the trash? I don't know. We disposed of the trash in the Dumpster last night. What are you doing with it? I am taking it to the furnace.
 We have a furnace?
 Absolutely. Where do you think the heat comes from? You burn the trash in the furnace? This bar runs on trash. This bar is totally green that way. How is burning trash green? Uh, because I'm recycling the trash into heat for the bar. And lots of smoke for the bar. I'm giving the bar the good smoky smell that we all like. The bar smells like trash. That's the exact opposite of green, Charlie. Oh, I'm sorry. Well, I could put the trash into a landfill where it's gonna stay for millions of years, or I could burn it up and get a nice, smoky smell in here and let that smoke go into the sky where it turns into stars. That doesn't sound right, but I don't know enough about stars to dispute it. It's right. No, it's not right. All right, are we almost done? No, we're not done. I got one more piece of business. What is it? Lastly, before I open the bar in the morning, I always make sure to turn on the Coors sign, let people know we got iced delicious Coors in the bar, you know, and then, uh, that's the last thing I do. Ol' Charlie's done a lot of work around here. Charlie, that sign does not say "Coors." Eh? Goddamn it. Come outside! Come outside! Come outside! [Mac] Goddamn it. Come outside. Closed! It says "closed," Charlie! Okay. [Chuckles] Yeah, right. I can see that now. But, you know, you can't really read it from the inside. You can't read it from the outside! You know what? Forget it. I can read it! Are we done with this? Have we gone through everything? Well, that was the last thing that I do, sure. Okay, great. You're fired! No, come on. You're not firing me. Yeah. Yeah. No way! Oh, I'm sorry! Oh, really? So you're gonna throw all the trash in the furnace yourselves. And you're gonna filter the rainwater barrel all by yourselves. And I suppose you're gonna fiddle with the electricity every day all by yourselves and siphon it from all around the neighborhood. No. We're gonna call a trash man, an electrician, and a plumber and not turn the closed sign on when the bar is open! [Horn Honking] [Mac] No, God! What is this? [Dennis] Are you kidding me? This is what I was talking about. We are gonna have a shantytown here in no time. [Mac] Shit! Goddamn it! Honey, I'm home! Feast your eyes on the new headquarters of Reynolds and Reynolds. Frank and I are starting a business. We sublet our apartments. We're living in here.
 Wait a second. You subletted our apartment?
 Yeah. Well, what the hell, dude? I don't know if I can live in a trailer, man. You don't have to, Charlie. It's kinda tight in there already. Well, hang on a second, bro. We're good in tight spaces. I'll make it work. I'm sorry, Charlie. What do you mean, you're sorry? There's no room at the inn. You kidding me, dude? You kidding me? Unbelievable! So now I'm reduced to sleeping in the bar! Oh, hell no! No, no, no. You're not gonna be sleeping in the bar. Where am I gonna live? On the streets? It's a recession. Times are tough. Yeah. You'll bounce back, buddy. Aw, come on, man. Can I at least live with you guys? [Both Laughing] We're not in the business of giving out handouts, Charlie. We're not the government. Frankly, I'm a little embarrassed that you would ask. Yeah, it's a little gauche. You guys are boning me, man. I tell you what, why don't you and I hit D&B's and talk bonuses? Yeah. All right. Dennis, why don't you go ahead and lock that door. You don't have to lock the door. Go ahead and lock him out. Keep out the riffraff. You don't have to lock the door. You don't have to add insult to injury. I'm gonna be fine. That's locked? Yeah.
 I got plenty of places to go.
 No, you don't! Okay, Frank, tell me about this business scheme you're cooking up. Give me your shoe. My shoe? Hand over your shoe. All right. Observe. Wait. No, no, no- Oh- Aw, come on, man! That's a $200 shoe! [Laughing] Look at that. What are you doing? Feast your eyes on your new business. Knives. You want me to sell knives door-to-door? No. You're selling vacuums. I'm sorry. I took out a high-interest loan to invest in a door-to-door knife and vacuum-selling business? Not just any vacuum. This is wet vac. Commercial power for the home. This'll get a red wine stain out of anything. Look. Oh, goddamn it! [Laughing] Check it out, Deandra. All right, this baby is powerful! Now, cover your ears because it has no muffler!
 [Motor Roaring]
 Oh! [Shouts] [Motor Continues Roaring] Ah! Oh, that's good merlot. Yeah. That's good merlot. You're gonna want to keep those coming. It might be cheaper if youse went with a bottle of wine instead of chugging the individual glasses. Mmm. Yeah, maybe leave the judgment back in the kitchen 'cause There's a little bit of a look of judgment on your face. Just go grab them and Okay, no problem. All right. Okay. Thank you. Great! Oh, she's terrific. I like her. Yeah, she's a cutie. All right, listen, Mac. I did bring you here for a specific reason, okay? Hmm? I got an idea for a stimulus plan for the bar that's gonna blow your freakin' mind. Stimulus plan? A stimulus plan. You want to hear it? Lay it on me, bro. Take a look around you right now. Now, at a time where businesses are simply failing left and right, who's thriving? Dave & Buster's. Dave & Buster's is thriving. Why do you think that is? I don't know. Video games? Video games are definitely a big part of it. I want you to do me a favor. Break down for me what I'm holding in my hand right now. Ah, that is a Dave & Buster's Power Card. Yes. Now, does your Dave & Buster's card work at any other similar establishments? Like, say, a T.G.I. Fridays? Mine does not, and believe me, I've tried at several locations. No, it doesn't. Yeah, 'cause I've actually been with you on many of those occasions where you've tried. Right. I don't think I've tried it enough. I think you have. Because clearly, at this point, you should've realized that it doesn't work anywhere else. There's one in Franklin Mills I haven't tried. I feel like that could maybe work. It's not gonna work there either. Let's move past that. I'm trying to make a point here. When you come to Dave & Buster's you spend your real money, but you leave with Dave & Buster's money. That gives you incentive to come back to Dave & Buster's 'cause it's the only place where your money works. I think that's brilliant. Maybe we should take a page out of D&B's book. And try the card at the Friday's out in the northeast No, you son of a bitch. We're way past that at this point. I don't understand why you can't grasp that point. It doesn't work anywhere else. It's only gonna work here. All right. I'm- I'm getting all worked up. Okay? This is- Let's I'm proposing that we print our own currency, okay? Make our own money? Yes! We call it Paddy's Dollars. Now we distribute that out to people for free initially. Then they become customers, and then they bring in new customers. And then once they're in, they have to use real dollars to buy Paddy's Dollars. That's exactly right, and that stimulates our own internal economy. Yeah, yeah, dude! That's a great plan! Then afterwards, we'll go out to Fox Chase and use the Power Card at that Friday's out there. Yeah, yeah, yeah! No, we won't. You can though. Look, Mom, um, I've kinda come on some hard times with the economy and everything. I got no place to go and everything, so I was figuring maybe I should move back into my old room for a little while till I get back up on my feet. Mmm, well, I don't think that's gonna work out, Charlie. Why not? I had to sublet your room to Uncle Jack. Is that why he's here? Hey, Charlie. Times are tough. And the economy is so bad I needed to get more money in in order to make the house payments. What are you talking about? You don't make house payments. You own this house. You've owned it for years. Mom, that's crazy.
 You collect Social Security.
 I need money. You can share the room with me, Charlie. [Gasps] That's a great idea!
 That is not a great idea.
 Well, why not? It'll be fun. You know, you and me palling around, getting nuts, doing crazy, fun things. I'm not doing any kind of things that you want me to do with you, Uncle Jack. No, it's- it's stuff that relatives do.
 We'll share the room, Charlie.
 I don't want to share the room with you, dude, because I I will spend the whole night wide awake like when I was a kid and you tried to share my room. You ever seen wrestling on television? I am well aware of what wrestling is. It's just not what uncles do to their nephews. I'm out of here. Hey, I'll call you later. I know you will. [Woman] Just grab any knife? Just the sharpest one in the kitchen. [Whispering] All right, now when I cut through the shoe and make the sale, you suggest casually that we have a drink to celebrate. Right. And? Then I drop a little wine on the carpet, grab the wet vac, and then call it a deal, whatever. Zing-o. This is the best knife I own. Oh. Oh. All right. Mmm. Well, if that's the best you have All right, now pretend that this shoe is an unboned chicken and you're gonna cook it tonight and make a tasty dinner that's gonna smell all through the house like cooked chicken. Actually, I'm vegan. Okay. Then pretend this shoe is whatever you people eat. Maybe it is a shoe. Nice one. Watch the way your knife cuts. Mmm. Oh, it's just flopping around. Oh, shoot. I-It, you know, doesn't Shit's not even making a dent in the leather. This knife is a piece of crap. Mm-hmm. Oh. Now take a look at our knife. Beautiful pressed steel Oh. With a nice, razor-sharp edge. Watch the way this knife blasts through this shoe with one motion. Uh-huh. Owww! Ohh! Ohh! Is this part of the whole thing? Oh, I cut myself! Ohh! It's a deep cut! Ohh! Ohh! I see your bones!
 It's a deep cut!
 I'll get you a towel! I'll get you a towel!
 Oh, Frank!
 It's okay. It's all right. I got Band-Aids in my bag. I just- I need your bathroom, that's all. Okay. All right. I'll just get my bag. Okay. Ohh! Okay. But Eew. Is he gonna be okay, 'cause Yeah. Yeah, no, no. He's gonna be fine, Beth. Don't worry. I tell you what- Why don't you and I have a glass of wine. Just bring it down a little bit, huh? I don't drink in the morning. Yeah, me neither. Oh, uh Oh, shoot! Oh! Oh, I'm missing it! Hey! Oh, no! You're doing that on purpose! I'm trying to prove a point here, Beth, okay? Hmm? I- I don't [Stumbling, Crashing] I'm gonna Okay, I- Yeah. Oh, boy. [Grunting] [Groans] Goddamn it!
 These Paddy's Dollars look great, bro.
 Yeah! I'm really glad we went with the color. They pop! Oh, yeah. Little bit more expensive than I would've thought. But that's worth it though. That's an old-poor move. You take your money and put it into something worth it, you're not tacky. See, by transferring all of our cash into these Paddy's Dollars and then printing more of these babies than we ever had in cash, we've upped our value. Shit! [Dennis] Oh, goddamn it. Look. Full-blown shantytown. We're screwed. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, dude. There could be some real opportunity in this. Yeah? Yeah, man. Think about this, dude. In recession times, what thrives more than anything else? Prostitutes. No- Well, yeah, that. But that and bars. Oh, and bars! Well, yeah! Right, because people gotta drown their sorrows. Get drunk! We own a bar! Yeah! So why don't we take these Paddy's Dollars and just distribute them amongst the shanties? That way- Right. They buy the booze from us with the dollars. Right. They run out of booze, then they gotta buy more Paddy's Dollars from us. Thus creating the self-sustaining economy we've been looking for. It stimulates our economy. That's what Dave & Buster's does. Give me one up here. Boom. Boom! Who wants some free money, shanties? [Laughing] When people stop buying vacuum cleaners and knives door-to-door, it can mean only one thing, Deandra. That you blew all of my money on a very stupid idea? No! Good-bye, recession, hello, depression. You're very lucky that you're with somebody as resilient as Frank Reynolds. You've tried to off yourself two times in the last 24 hours, Frank! Listen, this business partner of mine called. He's got a great plan. This is the man who's gonna make us rich. This is the man? Yes. This man lives in a cardboard box! Times is tough. Goddamn it. Yo! Hey! [Grunts] Thanks for getting down here so quick. It's Charlie? [Laughing] Hey, Charlie! Charlie is your new business partner? Yeah. Well, what do you want? We're good in tight spots. That's right. All right. You ready to do this? You got it. Okay, let's go! Let's go! You're the man with the plan. Deandra, this is gonna work. [Grunting] There we go. Look at that.
 Feast your eyes.
 Here we go!
 [Charlie Yells]
 What the hell is that? These are crabs! Fresh, local Delaware runoff crabs. Those don't look anything like crabs. Huh? Yeah, well- They look like sea scorpions. Isn't there some kind of, like, sewage runoff around here? Yeah, there's a pretty bad sewage runoff, but, you know, crabs is sewage-proof! And depression proof. People gotta eat. We're gonna sell these on the street.
 We're crab people now.
 Crab people. We're crab people now? Yes! You want us to become crab people? That's your new business plan? Yeah [Phone Ringing] Yeah. I'm getting a call. We'll live and die by the crab, Dee! We'll eat off the fat of the sea. Help me toss some of these babies back, 'cause legally we're not allowed to eat those. Oh, thank you very much! Thank you. Great news! Let's go! Forget the crabs! Okay.
 Nice doing business with you.
 All right, shanty! Enjoy it! All right. Enjoy yourselves. Boom! Okay. Hey! We did it. I think we made every single one of our Paddy's Dollars back. You're damn right. Thus creating the self-sustaining economy we've been looking for. That's right. How much fresh cash did we make? Fresh cash? Yes. Uh, well, zero. Zero, if you're talking about U.S. currency. People didn't really seem interested in spending any of that. That's okay. So when they run out of the booze, they'll come back in and they'll have to buy more Paddy's Dollars. Right. That is assuming, of course, that they will come back here and drink. They will because we'll redistribute these to the shanties, thus ensuring them coming back in, keeping the money moving. Well, no, if we just redistribute these, then people will continue to drink for free. Okay. How does this work, Mac? The money keeps moving in a circle. But- But we don't have any money. All we have is this. How does this work, dude? I don't know. I thought you knew. I thought you- What? I thought you were on top of this! You're the one that came up with the plan! Did I come up with this plan? Last night, dude, with the D&B Power Card and the- Oh, I blacked out that night. Shit, dude! I've been following your lead! Oh, Jesus. Oh, shit. Okay, so we have no money and no inventory. There's still something we can do. That's still a business somehow. How does D&B's do it? They've got a complicated system. I cannot begin to understand it. How does a self-sustaining economy work? I don't understand how the U.S. economy works, much less some sort of a self-sustaining one. I don't understand how finances work. Shots for everybody! The government is reimbursing me all the money I lost! I love this country! Baby, I'm back! Wait, you got a bailout? Yeah, you know it, pal! Can you bail us out, Frank? Because we're kind of screwed here. I'll tell you what. Let's discuss it over steaks and Skee-Ball. Oh! [Laughing, Yelling] Hey, bailouts all around! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! I love this country! [Charlie] Crab meat! Crab meat! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!
 Crab meat!
 Crab meat! Uh, you guys don't think that you're going to Dave & Buster's, do you? Uh- What? [Voices Speaking Backwards]                        [Dennis] Hey, come on, man. Be careful, man. You're spilling on the floor. [Dee] I don't understand why you don't just use a cup. I'm trying to be inconspicuous. Inconspicu Your entire mouth is stained red, Frank. It is? Yeah. Aren't we gonna be at the barbecue soon? Yeah. I'm pregaming, man. What's going on with you? You're going off the deep end lately. I feel like he's been wading around in the deep end for a while. No, bro, it's different. He's staying out all hours of the night. I never see him. If he is around, he's usually not even wearing clothes. [Mac, Dennis Laughing] I'm wearing clothes now, bitch. You're wearing a shirt that's on inside out and it's covered in grease. Yeah, you're really greasy. It's not grease. It's sap.
 Sap? How did you get covered in sap?
 I got really wasted.
 I must've climbed a tree.
 You're really stepping up the insanity, huh? I'm trying to push myself. I want to see how far I could go. I feel like you've been standing on the edge of a cliff for a while now. I say hop off. Let's see where you land. I really wish you wouldn't encourage him, man. I really wish you wouldn't. If somebody wants to push his boundaries, you gotta let him. Frank, jump. I never felt more alive in my life. Oh, I'm sure. I'm sure. There's the street, right there. What the hell? I thought we were going to a barbecue, Frank. It's more of a party in the park. We're at a cemetery. The party is in the cemetery.
 Who has a party in a cemetery?
 [Frank] Your Uncle Max. He just croaked. Flush that turd down the drain! [Chuckles]  [Bagpipes: "Amazing Grace"] Does anybody else feel really uncomfortable? Yes. We're completely underdressed. It's embarrassing. What are we doing here, Frank? What's your angle? I wanna bang your Aunt Donna. Why would you wanna bang our mom's sister at the funeral of her husband? Hmm. Well, I don't know how many years on this earth I got left. I'm gonna get real weird with it. Meanwhile, block the wind. I'm gonna roast this bone. [Dee] Okay. Jesus Christ. Come on. Get in there. [Dennis] What are you doing? That is enough. I've had enough. He's definitely reached his limit. I've reached my limit, that's for sure. Dude, this is what I was talking about in the car. The guy is going off the deep end, all right? Now it's starting to affect our lives. Yeah. And I think maybe we should have an intervention or something. An intervention might be a good idea. If he starts banging Aunt Donna, we're gonna have the garbage pail cousin in the mix. No! No! Whoa. Who is the garbage pail cousin? Gail the Snail is the garbage pail cousin. Oh, Charlie, she is the worst. We'd have these family parties and she'd just glob onto me and Dennis. We couldn't get rid of her. The only way was to torture her. And that's what we did. Yeah. We'd throw her in the dryer. We'd throw salt on her. Yeah, we'd throw salt on her 'cause she was the snail. Mm-hmm. Get it? Get it? You throw salt on a snail, and It shrivels her up. It's supposed to shrivel up. Well, that sounds a little messed up though, huh? You don't think we're proud of that, do you? No. But you don't understand. That's the only way you can handle her. She made us do those things. And quite frankly, I resent her for it. What kind of a person salts another human being? It's terrible. There's no joy in salting someone. Everyone loses. Yeah. It sounds like a- What's up, suckers? Hey, Gail. Hey, Gail. You look different. I'm more confident. I've grown into my body. You're sure showing a lot of skin, huh? Jealous? I'm a woman now. I'm not a virgin anymore. Cool. Thank you. Okay. [Slurps] Hey, guys, you wanna come to my car and take a puff? I got some medical marijuana. [Slurps]
 We're at your dad's funeral, Gail.
 What evs. I'm over it. Plus, if we all showed up super high at the reception, everyone would be like, "What?" [Slurps] Uh- Uh- Okay. Come on. Whatever, Gail. Yes, we'll do that. Wait in the car and we'll join you. We'll come get you.
 You guys gonna come?
 We'll come in a second.
 Like five minutes?
 Five minutes.
 Anything. Yes. Anything. Whatever you say. [Growls] See, this is what happens when you don't have salt. My God. There's not enough salt in the world for her. The garbage pail cousin. Donna, Donna, Donna, Donna, Donna, Donna. Hello, Frank. You surprised to see me? No. Ooh. You left several voice mails congratulating me on my husband's death. Well, I was pretty baked. What do you want? I have a proposition for you. I think you and me ought to bang. What? Okay. Hear me out. Max never liked me. I hated him. Barbara didn't like you. You despised her. Now, what better way to get back at them in the grave, really stick it to 'em, if you and me plowed? I mean, really- [Grinds Teeth] Hmm? You get back to me. Hey. I'm Mac. [Sighs] Barbara's ex-lover. She may have mentioned You were gonna say something? No. [Lips Smack] You said- No? No. I was just breathing. I'll start by commending you guys for taking the initiative to help Frank. Ah, we're caring people. That's our nature. Um, what's Frank struggling with the most right now? Ooh. Ah, he is trying to bang our aunt. That's the big one. Uh, these things deal more with drug and alcohol abuse. [Dee] Mm-hmm. Drugs and alcohol are rolled into what we're talking about here Oh, yeah. With the aunt thing. So he does have a drinking problem. Oh, big time. Big time. Oh, lady. But if I'm being honest, my problem's less with the fact that he's drinking and more that he's doing it without me. And then I start thinking, "What's wrong with me? Am I not fun to drink with?" Oh, no. Don't do that to yourself. You're plenty of fun to drink with. Trust me, Charlie. You get really, really drunk. Oh, yeah. And then you get reckless, and it's a lot of fun. So how do we go about doing this? Do we ambush him and then sort of like berate him into becoming the guy we wanna be around? You certainly don't berate him. He needs to know you're coming from a place of love and concern. Mm-mmm. Too soft. I think we should come at him with an iron fist and crush him into submission. Right, right. If we're taking that approach, you might wanna be armed at this intervention. Mm-hmm. Why- Why would I need to be armed? Well, Frank's usually carrying a little gun with him.
 And he doesn't really hesitate to use it.
 [Dennis] And you know what? Have the gun out and ready to rock when he comes in.
 We'll all have guns.
 It's just safer. She could put it in her pants. If we maybe ambush Frank with a net or some kind of rope device, the gun will maybe drop out of his waist belt. You wanna bring him in in a net?
 [Dennis] That could get awkward.
 Just bring the gun. Bring a gun. I don't wanna get shot, so just bring a gun, will you? You know, I do offer group therapy. Yeah. What are you doing? What is this you're doing? What is that? What is that? With all due respect, you're talking about bringing guns to an intervention, and you're drinking wine out of a soda can. Yeah. You put wine in the soda can? You didn't know, did you? That's good. Soda. You stole Frank's idea. Actually, it's a pretty good one. It's a good idea. The guy's got great ideas. He's a smart man. That's not what we're here about.
 But I do feel like she just tried an intervention on us.
 Did you intervene on us? You know what I'm feeling? I'm feeling like you've lost control of the room here. And we're the ones that are running things now. I've lost my trust in you.
 We can do this on our own.
 We can do the intervention without her. You guys think? Why not? All right. Might as well give it a shot. Let's just do that. [Dee] Thank you. Thanks for your help. You did your best. After you. No hard feelings. I'm gonna grab some of this literature. She didn't do that great of a job. No, but don't beat her while she's down. [Chuckles, Gurgling] [Gurgling Continues] Frank, here's another idea. Oh! Oh! Where'd you come from? I've been walking next to you the entire time. I'm sorry. I'm a little, uh, lit. And, uh, I've been going over this thing. I'm trying to figure out how- How to bang Donna. I know. You've been talking about it for the last five miles. Dude, it doesn't matter. I got a better idea. I think you should bang Gail the Snail. My niece? Yeah. Gail the Snail? Dude, what's more depraved than that, huh? Plus, you're not blood related, so it's not that weird. [Belches] That is a good idea. I like the way you're thinking. [Belching] Ew! What's in it for you? Huh? [Belching] Oh! Jesus! What's in it for you? Don't worry about what's in it for me, dude. [Belches] Good God! You are disgusting. A disgusting animal. [Belches, Gurgling] Mm. Charlie. Let's write him a letter. Let's write Frank a letter. That's the first step in any intervention, right? Huh. Yeah. Great. All right. So I'm assuming you'll have to dictate yours to me, and then I'll just write it down for you, yeah? Yes, that'll be fine. Okay, great. Let's- Let's do that. Okay, uh, I guess my letter would be about how Frank and I aren't really making memories together anymore, and how when we don't make memories together, that's a hurtful thing for me. Okay. Uh, you know, let's just dive right in. I'm not even gonna try and suss out where you're going with that one. Right. Um, number one when was the last time we played Night Crawlers together, Frank? Oh. Oh, okay. What is that? Well, it's not about you. Why don't you just write it down, and then Yeah, but you said it. You said "Night Crawlers," and now I feel like I can't move past it. I gotta know what that is. It's- It's no big deal. You know? I If I were you, I'd just write it down because it's not really a big deal. What is it? It's what it sounds like. What it sounds like is that you two crawl around like worms in the night. That's what it sounds like. [Smacks Lips] This is not about you, so I'd like for you
 [Metal Banging]
 Damn! Shut up! Guess what! What? We got you! What do you guys think? I thought when Frank comes in, we'll just bang and make a bunch of noise. Oh, yeah. Ha! We've got you! All right. But the pain is a little agitating. That's overboard, I think.
 [Dee] It's too much?
 I think that's too far. The yelling and pointing and accusing and saying that he's trapped and surrounded is probably gonna be- That's gonna be great. By the way, you guys, can I just say, as a side note, I am loving this canned wine thing. I think it's brilliant. Right? I'm active. I'm gesturing with my hands, and I don't feel restricted. If I was holding a wine glass, I'd be spilling wine all over the goddamn place. It would get everywhere. We're not intervening on Frank for a lack of good ideas. Well, that's for sure. Oh, no. Well, guys, maybe we're not doing the right thing. You're talking a lot about wine. You got it all over your lips and teeth. Maybe we need the help of a professional. We should probably get that lady back. What are you talking about? We're coming up with all kinds of good ideas. We're flowing here. I feel like we got some good stuff. I just feel like- Maybe we should consult with the pamphlets, right? The pamphlets I grabbed from the office. Oh, okay. Well, I've been meaning to bring that up. I took a lot at those pamphlets that you grabbed, and not a single one of them has anything to do with intervention. It's not even close. I'm starting to think we need to intervene on you for your goddamn illiteracy. Yeah, Charlie, you are getting real dumb. Come on. All right. See, this is what I'm talking about. Illiteracy. What does that word even mean? Come on. I'm gonna get the lady, 'cause this is gettin' crazy. We need help. I'm gettin' the lady. [Sizzling]  [Humming]
 Whoa.
 How you doin', Frank? What the hell are you doing here? Frank, my plan is finally coming together. With you out of the picture, I can swoop in on Donna. Is that why you pushed me off onto the Snail? Yeah, that's right, bitch. But that's what you wanted anyway, right? You wanted to be as depraved as possible. Yeah. But I think the Snail is too depraved even for me. This broad is berserk. [Gail] Wake and bake. You guys bang? Oh, no. We did a bunch of those Monster Energy drinks and dry humped. It was awful. I think she gave me poison ivy. [Grunts] Hey, hey there, sleepyhead. I made you breakfast. I hope you like it crispy 'cause it is burned. What is going on in here? How did you get in my house? Did you kick in my door? Kick, yes. Kick in, no. That door is solid, which is the good news. The bad news is the window is not. That's gonna be a security concern. But don't worry. I'm gonna fix it, make sure it's up to snuff. You're always safe when you're with me. Are you ready for your breakfast? I'm sorry. What is happening here? I haven't any idea, honestly. I'm giving Frank a handy under the table. [Groans] That is true. Look, Snail- Back off. Because you're just mashing it now. It's not For God sakes, Gail. Mom, I'm sexually active now. Get over it. You're 33 years old. You're supposed to be sexually active. You're not supposed to be fondling your uncle under a table. We're not blood related. Will you just please leave her alone? I'll make a deal with you. I dump the Snail if you and I go out. Frank, you can't do that. Donna's my girl. I called her first at the funeral. Fair is fair. Let me make something perfectly clear. I will never be with either of you. Why are you doing this to me? Why can't you just let me be happy? I want everybody out of my house. Jesus Christ. Out of my house! Okay!
 Fine.
 Not you. You live here, Gail. I hate it here. I'm leaving. I'm going with this guy. He's my boyfriend.
 I'm taking some eggs.
 I am not your boyfriend. Frank, what is with this chick? She's berserk. Oh, okay. I get it. So Frank sits there, and we put stools in a semicircle. You wanna make sure there's a border all around him so there's no going anywhere. And zing him from every angle. Yep. Okay.
 That makes sense.
 There she is! Hey! Hey! Thank you for coming!
 [Laughs]
 We really appreciate this. We really appreciate it. Well, I'm here because clearly your friend is in desperate need of help. [All] Yeah, yeah, yeah! Well, we realize we also just need as many people attacking this guy as we can possibly get. Mm-hmm. Well, not attacking. This is why I'm glad you called me back. Yeah, okay, listen. Before we get into that, could you help us pop a quick intervention on Charlie for his illiteracy? The kid can't read or write. Not a bit.
 [Laughing]
 No joke. It's no joke. They've been riding me all day. I can read and write. I just don't like to read and write. Let's try and stay focused on Frank. That's a good point. He's gonna be here any second. We told him there was a giant grease fire
 and he had to come down immediately.
 [Charlie, Dennis Chuckling] Uh-oh. She's- I'm assuming you wouldn't have lured him down with a fire. Is that what your face is doing right now? Yeah. Um, and I wouldn't have an intervention at a bar either. [Laughing] Well, lady, look, all mistakes we've made on our own, so it's good that you're here. We're doing our best. We're doing our best. Where's the goddamn fire? [Gun Cocks] Intervention! Intervention! Ah, intervention! Intervention! I got it! I got it! You're surrounded, Frank! There's nowhere for you to go. You're trapped. You're trapped. [All Chanting] You're trapped! You're trapped! Got you! Got you! You're trapped!
 That's enough! That's enough!
 We told you there was gonna be a gun. What the hell's going on? Got you, man! Sit down! You sit down so we can tell you what an asshole you've been. We're gonna get all in your face and point out your faults. A roast? I've always wanted to be roasted. Oh, wait. Let me just switch gears here fire up this spliff. No, no, no, no. Wait. Frank, hold on. Um, everyone's here today because they care about you and they want you to get well. She ain't funny. Next. Frank, you're an asshole. Ah! That's it.
 Now rain down on me. Come on.
 You're a prick! And your addiction has affected us in the following ways. You are annoying! Dennis, come on! Give it to me with both barrels! Why do we never play Night Crawlers anymore, huh? I don't know, Charlie. What is Night Crawlers? It's a game where they crawl around in the night like worms. I never said that. Yeah, well, that's what it is. Intervention! Intervention! Is nothing private, Frank? Jesus! Look, I like that game. I don't wanna stop playing it. Well, Charlie, we can play that game. You promise? Yeah. Whoo! Ahh! Yeah. Stop touching me. [Speaks, Indistinct]
 [Mac] Just stop.
 [Dee] Whoa! What's this? Me and Mac are together. No! No! No! Intervention! Intervention! Intervention! What are you interventioning me for? Because you can't be banging Gail the Snail. I'm not banging Gail the Snail. She followed me home. [Slurps] Oh! She was doing that the whole time. [Dee] Yeah, she does that. Swallow it or spit it out. No, don't! Oh, my God. See? Intervention! Hey, babe, I'll get you a drink from the bar. Great. My God. What are you doing, Mac? I was just going over to her house to try and bang Donna because she reminds me so much of your mom, which is the best sex I ever had.
 [Groans]
 Intervention. Intervention. [Mac] Huh? You banged my dead wife? Well, she was alive at the time.
 But- Did you not know that?
 No. It's cool, man. It's cool. Intervention. Intervention. Okay? Look, he's got a weird fetish for older women, so don't hold it against him. I don't have an older-woman fetish. Yeah, you do. I don't wanna bang this chick. Let's cool it with the intervention stuff for a second 'cause there's a lot of 'em being thrown around right now, and I'm having a little bit of trouble keeping track. The most important intervention is the one we need to do on Gail the Snail and getting her out of our lives. Guys, let's do shots and get crazy. No, Gail. No. We're intervening on you, Snail. Go. Get out of here. Yeah, right. How is she not getting this? She's stonewalling us. It is a classic Snail technique. Classic. Ya! Get out of here, Snail! [Dennis] He's got the salt! Salt the Snail! Ya, ya, ya! Go, Snail! Ya, ya, ya! Ya! Ya! Hey, guys! Guys, guys! I was gonna invite you guys all to a rave to hang out, but now I don't wanna hang out with you anymore. Oh, my God. Salt the Snail. Just salt her. Wait, wait! Do you guys wanna go? No, no! We don't wanna go! Wait! I have glow sticks. Salt the Snail! [All Shouting] [Dee] The whole thing!
 Ya, ya, ya!
 What is with that broad? She is the worst, right? That's what we've been saying. Oh, my God. That was a terrible experience for me by the way. Of course it was. Nobody likes salting the Snail, but she gives you no choice.
 She doesn't leave you with any options.
 What a horrible thing. I'm all worked up now. I feel bad. I feel like maybe I should have some more wine in a can. I'll get you one. I can use some canned wine to calm down a little bit. Oh, you guys are drinking wine out of those cans? Oh, you guys are drinking wine out of those cans? Hell, yeah, baby. Hell, yeah. Can I have one? Yes, and you will notice the advantages almost immediately. Here. Try this. I feel like drinking wine out of a can is conducive to my violent hand gestures when I speak. You tend to be very emphatic and strong and- There's no spillage. Say I wanna give one to Frank. You didn't get any on me. I spilled a little. You wanna point accusatorily, but But it really boosts your mobility. Excuse me. Excuse- Excuse me. People, I- I'm sorry, but how do you guys wanna proceed from here? Because I'm a little confused. Ohh! Did you wanna- Right. Okay. Um- Well, I guess we kind of got what we needed out of the intervention. Yeah. Right? So good job. Was it? Did she? We did all the work, didn't we? So we can't really pay you 'cause of that. I know we said we would, but we won't. Yeah. Um, how about a can of wine? [Dennis] Oh. [Scoffs] No. Oh. All right. Well Okay, well, on your way. Adios. On your way then. Take your jacket. Get out of here. Take that shoulder-padded jacket and get the hell out. Thanks for stopping by. Don't expect a check in the mail. Hey! Up top! Up top, everybody! [Dee] Great intervention! Great intervention! Great intervention work! [Voices Speaking Backwards]                        [Dee] I don't know. What do you think? It's kind of doing nothing for my hip area and making a mess of my boobs. You know what? Why don't you go grab five more? Look, we don't normally do this. But I think I'm gonna need some proof that you're actually getting married. What? Why? Because you've been coming in here and trying on wedding dresses every Saturday for over a year now. Yeah. That's 'cause it takes a really long time to plan a wedding. Don't get up all over my balls, Lucy. Just go get the dresses. When is the wedding? Soon. Where? A church. Which one? The nearby one. The nearby one? Right down the street. Which street? Spring. What's your fiancÃ©'s name? Sam. What does he do? S-S-Salt. Salt? Sea salt. Sea salt. He's a salt seaman. He- He dives in to the ocean for the sea salt. And then he brings it back up. And then we eat it. So- Okay, I'm getting the manager. Well, don't get the- [Sighs] Damn it.
 Dee Reynolds?
 Yeah. Brad Fisher. From high school. Brad Fisher. No way. Yeah. You look amazing. Your acne cleared up really well. I kinda grew into myself. Yes, you did. Yes, you did. Why did I ever break up with you, you beefcake? It was because of the acne. Was it because of the acne? Yeah. Yeah. Uh, when it got real bad, you dumped me and you said it was 'cause I was gonna grow up to look like Edward James Olmos. Well, I don't really remember saying exactly that. It's- It's fine. We were kids. We were kids. We were kids! Yeah. We're not kids anymore. No. Great. Wow. So you're- you're getting married. Wow. Yeah. Uh, no, I'm not. I'm not. This is because I was. But that- that didn't work out. Why are you asking? Are you single? What's your situation? Um, I'm engaged. Oh. Yeah. I mean, that's why I'm here. My fiancÃ©e's trying on a dress. I know I'm not supposed to see it before the wedding. But we're having a whole nontraditional kinda small thing. So you should meet her. Babe. Well, nah
 [Woman] Yeah?
 Come here for a second. I want you to meet a friend of mine. What do you think of this one, Brad? It's beautiful, yeah. Oh, my God. [Buzzing] [Mac] Okay. All right. Well, don't poke at it. Don't just poke Just get it safely into the box. Dude, you're gonna agitate the bees. Well, I'm fine with the bees. It's the honey I don't want to agitate. Is that your endgame here? Honey? Yeah. I figure if we keep the hive in the basement, we'll always have honey. [Buzzing] We'll always have bees is what we'll always have. Whoa! What? What? I think I just saw a wasp. I think that was a wasp. You see that? Looked like a wasp. Didn't look like a bee. Is this a wasp nest? This is a wasp nest. I'm out! I'm out! All right. Yeah, yeah. I don't want to tangle with a bunch of wasps. Hey! Do- Do wasps make honey? [Buzzing] No. Wasps do not make honey. All right. Well, I'm gonna check it out anyway. There could be something delicious in here that wasps do make, and I want that. Mac, Dennis, can I talk to you in the office, please? Why can't we just talk right here? Yeah? Because it's private. Ah, that sounds like a whole thing. I'm not into it.
 Mmm.
 [Screaming] Shit! I just got stung! That was a hornet! This is a hornets nest! Uh, you know what, guys? Why don't we step in the back office while Charlie deals with this whole hornet/wasp situation? Yeah. Oh. Oh, I'm a bad boy? I'm a bad boy? Put some vegetable oil on it. That'll make you feel better. Okay. Bye, sexy. Ohh. Who was that? That's my booty call. We're into some really weird food fetish stuff. Gross. Okay, you guys, listen up. We got a serious problem. The waitress is getting married. Oh, yeah. I heard about that. Artemis told me.
 Since when do you talk to Artemis?
 She's my booty call. Weird. We'll get into that later. Right now, we gotta deal with this waitress situation. Dee, why do you give a shit that the waitress is getting married? She's been nothing but trouble for us. That's a good point. She doesn't seem to get our sense of humor. We do stuff that I think's funny. She doesn't. Hilarious! Guys! I cannot believe you're not thinking about Charlie right now. This is gonna crush him. What? You don't give a shit about Charlie. All you care about is the fact the waitress is getting married before you. Right? That or she's afraid that Charlie might blow his brains out. And then she'd have to do all the Charlie work. Uh, that's what it is. Yeah. Okay, fine. A: I do not want to do Charlie's work once he kills himself. B: How could the waitress get married before me? I'm way hotter than she is. And C: Get this. The guy she's marrying used to be my boyfriend. You know what I just realized? I don't care about anything she's saying. Not a bit. What I do care about is the fact that Charlie might go postal if he finds out about this and kill all of us. Right. Shit. We're probably the ones at real risk here, huh? Yeah. Okay. Well, maybe we should find something to distract him until the whole wedding thing blows over. Mm-hmm.
 Get him his own booty call.
 Ohh! Or at least another chick to stalk. Hey! Great. In the meantime, I'll try and sabotage the wedding by luring Brad away from her. Ahh. Dee, save yourself the embarrassment. Yeah, yeah. Let's- Watch out for the hornets. Yeah. Don't push me. [Knocking] [Door Opens] Hey-oh! Hey, what's- Ahh! What are you doing there, buddy? I'm trying to smoke these hornets to death so I can get their honey. They keep flying up the tube, stinging me on my face. I think I just swallowed one. As I tried to explain before, you cannot get honey from a hornets nest. I just don't think there's any science to support that, buddy. There's some very basic science out there supporting that. No. No. Trust me, pal. It's a fact. It's not even science. Why are you bothering getting into it with him? I don't know. I just feel like Charlie, we're gonna get you back on the dating scene, bro. What do you think about that? Yeah. That's actually why we're here. We're gonna put your profile on Match.com. I don't see why. I got the waitress, guys. Yeah. Yeah, right. Sure, right. Uh, yeah, totally. We thought maybe you could meet somebody new. Yeah. Someone you like even more than the waitress. I don't see how that's possible. But I tell you what, let me pop a quick "H" on this box. This way we all know it's filled with the hornets. Okay? Okay, yeah. Do what you gotta do. These things sting like a bitch, man. First thing we gotta do is take your picture for the profile. So Ahh. So, do you have the makeup?
 Yeah.
 Oh, no makeup! Come on. Well, those hornet stings are pretty bad, buddy. So I think we're gonna have to Yeah. But I am who I am. Right. But- Yeah, but Let's do who you are minus the hornet stings. Let's pretend you're not who you are and just try to attract a woman. I tell you what. What if I wore a checkered hat and I smoked a pipe? That'd work. Why would you want a checkered hat and a pipe? You know, for the Sherlock Holmes look. Why would you want to look like Sherlock Holmes?
 Who are you trying to attract exactly?
 Intelligent women. Okay. I'm just gonna take the photo right now without the makeup
 and see if he likes it. Ready?
 Yeah.
 Ooh, that felt good. Was that sexy?
 That's very That felt sexy. We'll Photoshop it. Yeah, I can see where this is going. Let's just not do that. We'll just Photoshop it. Let's- Let's- You want to take another one? No. No. We'll find another picture that we can use and that'll be fine. Yeah. Let's talk about your likes and dislikes.
 How about your favorite food. What would that be?
 Oh, milk steak. Hmm? Hmm? What?
 Milk steak.
 I'm not putting milk steak. Just put steak. Just put regular steak. And then- I'm gonna put steak. Put milk steak. She'll know what it is. She won't know. Nobody knows what that is. She'll know what it is. No- Okay, all right. What's your favorite hobby? Uh, magnets. Magnets? Okay, what, like making magnets, collecting magnets? Playing with magnets? Just magnets. I'm gonna put snowboarding. We'll put snowboarding. I don't really snowboard.
 All right, what are some of your likes?
 Uh, ghouls. Son of a bitch. What are you talking about now? You know, funny little green ghouls, go- What?
 What, like in movies and cartoons? What are you-
 Little green ghouls, buddy. Don't write ghouls! I'm not. I'm putting travel.
 Jesus Christ! What are your dislikes?
 People's knees. Come on! Come on! You gotta be kidding. You know what? We'll make it up. We'll make the whole thing up. Let's get out of here! We'll doctor the picture. We're not even gonna use you. Cover your knees up if you're gonna be walking around everywhere. Where are you? Come on. Bingo, bitch.
 Hey!
 [Horns Honking]
 Hey. You guys, how are you? [Horns Honking] All right, calm down! I'll be two seconds! Anyway, hi! How are you? What are you doing? Okay, so listen up. I was thinking since, Brad, you were saying how your wedding was gonna be all poor or boring or dull or whatever it was you were You said our wedding was gonna be dull? I said it was gonna be small. Small! Yup, that's exactly what it was. I was thinking I could help you guys out by throwing you a bachelorette party! Brad, you can totally come since you guys decided to do that nontraditional mumbo jumbo. I think we're good. You know what, though. I kinda would like to meet some of your friends. Hold on here. Hold on. What am I hearing? You haven't met some of her great friends? It's just because this happened really quickly. Is it a yes or a no? 'Cause you're kinda holding up traffic here. It's- It's rude. [Man] Come on, lady! Well Look, I think it sounds great. It sounds like fun. Okay, perfect! Wonderful! We've got a deal. See you guys tomorrow night, my place, at 8:00. [Horns Honking] Bye, Brad. Good to see you. Okay! Calm down, dick wads! It wasn't that bad!  [Pop] [Coughing] Deandra, you got any bacon bits? We like to put 'em in Artemis's hair and they rain down on me when we bang. I feel like a Cobb salad. It's amazing. Okay. I have no idea why anyone would want to feel like a Cobb salad. But whatever, that's good. Bring that up when Brad's here. All right, Mrs. Mac, make sure that you talk about how the waitress looks exactly like you when you were young, right? You remember that? There's a whole carton of cigarettes in it for you. [Coughing] Uh, Mrs. Kelly, remember, this man that I'm bringing over, he wants to steal the love of your son's life away. Nobody hurts my Charlie! Yup, that's good. That's good. Keep that up. And keep the drinking coming.
 'Cause it makes you get all weird. All right, this is-
 [Knocking] Oh, okay. They're here. Is everyone ready? You guys got it? Okay. [Clears Throat] There they are! Sorry we're late. Somebody took a little convincing. Yup. I really didn't want to come, but Brad insisted. Oh, you big, old, fat stick in the mud! Come on in, you guys.
 They're here, everybody!
 [Groans]
 What's up?
 Here you go. Would you like some punch? Is there alcohol in this? No, no, no, no. No, absolutely not. I remember what an embarrassing problem you have with alcohol. Brad, did you know about her unfortunate problems with drugs and alcohol? IsnÂt that sad? It's just alcohol. Is it? And he's aware. Oh. Really? I thought there was, like, cocaine and heroin. And remember when you were shooting up with the homeless people and banging for money on the street? No. no. Wow. You're making all of that up. Really? Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what? You're absolutely right. I'm confusing you with another pathetic drunk that I know. So you can still have fun, can't you, Brad? I can. I Let's get a beer. Okay. Whoo-hoo. You look really nice tonight. You like that? You like that? [Dee] The color of this shirt. I don't know what it's doing to your eyes, but I like it.  [Continues]

Listen, you remember your backstory? No? Oh, for God's sakes! What is that? I don't remember the backstory. All right, listen, man. You're a philanthropist. That's what you are, okay? You used to own a small business. But you gave all that up to help others. All right, who do I help? Who am I helping? Oh, God. It doesn't matter. I don't know, old people, uh, children, autistics, dyslexic folks. It really doesn't matter, Charlie. I'm a full on re Ph-Philio- Philian- Philanthropist. Dude, I can't get it. How do you say it? What is it? [Together] Philanthropist! Meet us in the bathroom. Oh, my God, dude! What is that? What was that? Is that cheese? Have you eaten cheese? How much cheese have you eaten today? How much cheese is too much cheese? Any amount of cheese before a date is too much cheese! I had a lot of cheese. I had a block of cheese. Okay, okay- You ate a block of cheese today? I was very nervous. I started eating cheese, man. All right. All right, all right. Does that calm you down? Just don't breathe in her direction, okay? Whatever you do. How do I look? Relax. Stick to the game plan. Do I look handsome? You look great. [Dee] Okay. So I thought we would play a game. Sort of a newlywed-type of game. And see how well you two know each other, okay?

Okay, new plan. New plan. New plan. Charlie, make a move. Just tell her you want to bang her. Ooh. No, that's- Is that how you get chicks? Well, he's got a 50-50 shot.
 That's a good point!
 It is a yes-or-no scenario. It is a no scenario! Why? Don't approach her that way. That's not gonna work. Am I getting the shirt? You're not gonna get the shirt. This is what you're gonna do. Go back out there. Start asking her questions about herself. Talk to her about being a lawyer, okay? I can do that. Right? Right? That's gonna work. If anything goes wrong, I'll come out there, I'll say I'm the manager of Gugino's. Do you understand? Okay. All right? I got it. I know. I understand it. You good? We'll be good. All right, great. [Groaning] Just go. Just get out there. Just go. Yeah. Hey, I'm sorry about that. It took a little while. There was a guy in the bathroom. He wouldn't give me his shirt. And I was fighting him. I'm, like, "Give me your shirt, bro. " And he didn't want to give it to me.
 And it was like a whole thing.
 Uh, uh, uhh! Hi. Uh, I'm the manager. And Mr. Kelly is one of our preferred customers. It's so wonderful to see you here again this evening. Right. My good man. Now I'm gonna want the milk steak boiled over hard and a side of your finest jellybeans, raw. [Laughs] Mr. Kelly, you have the most wonderful sense of humor. Hey, I own this joint. And I know this guy. And he is loaded. Mr. Kelly, we have your milk boiling just the way you like it back there for your steak. You're gonna like this. How's about I clear out the coat room and you guys hit it in there while the steak is getting ready?

 What are you doing?
 I'm leaving! You're grabbing her breasts? What are you doing? I don't know. What does "make a move" mean? It doesn't mean stab at her breasts with your fingers. Oh, man! Come on, bro. You're ordering milk steak and jellybeans? What the hell? Come on, you guys blew it, dude! We blew it? I told you to stick with the game plan! It was going great! I had it! You don't know shit about chicks, man!
 We don't know shit about chicks?
 Yeah! Well, guess what, bro. The waitress is getting married. So suck on that! I see. Well, I suppose I'll be taking that milk steak to go then. Yeah. And so the Wendy's manager is all, "You gotta clean that up!" And I said, "They're your hamburgers. You clean 'em up." And then Artemis got all bummed out because of something I did with the onions to myself. And now she won't talk to me. Frank, I don't give a shit about any of this. Hey, man, where's the baseball bat? Baseball bat in the corner. Oh. We're trying to arm ourselves 'cause Charlie's gonna be here any minute, and he might take us out, so Oh, don't worry about Charlie. Charlie's over this. In fact, I saw him this morning. He said he was bringing the guy a congratulatory gift. Really? Yeah. Oh, great. [Doorbell Buzzes] Hey, what's- what's, uh- what's this? This is for your engagement, man. You're a lucky, lucky dude. And, uh, congratulations to you. Oh, right. No, no, no. That's not happening anymore. We're not, uh- We're not engaged. You're not getting married? Nah. Oh! You're Charlie Kelly, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember you from high school. Hang on a second, dude. You're not getting married? Well- [Clears Throat] Remember how everybody used to make fun of us in high school? I remember how they made fun of you. Anyway, I have been getting my revenge. I've been getting engaged to all these chicks who broke up with me in high school 'cause of my acne, and then I dump 'em right before the wedding. [Chuckles] Damn. Yeah. I just got through doing it to that coffee shop waitress. Now I'm gonna do it to this chick Dee Reynolds. Remember her? She was the worst. Yeah. Uh, so that coffee shop waitress, she must've been hurt kinda bad by that though, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. She was- She was devastated. Oh. So Well, tell you what, man. Why don't you go ahead and have this present anyway? Really? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I feel like you deserve it. [Chuckles] Well, thanks, dude. Yeah. That's- That's rad. All right. Okay. Well, keep it real, man. Okay. Okay. All right. [Buzzing Faintly] [Chuckles] [Voices Speaking Backwards]                        [Gavel Raps] [Woman] Next case. Mr. Dennis Reynolds. [Dennis] That's me. Yeah. Right here. How are ya? [Chuckles] From October 28, 2008, to November 1, 2008, you were issued a series of parking citations totaling $1,300.
 Who are these people?
 Oh, uh, these people are here to corroborate my story.
 It's a parking violation.
 Oh, well. I think you'll find it goes much, much deeper than that. Yes, Lady Madam of the court, I do believe that this court will realize that we were all victims of a terrible ordeal that caused each and every one of us great physical and emotional trauma. And what is this ordeal? The Philadelphia Phillies winning the World Series, Your Honor. Okay, Mr. Reynolds. On what grounds are you contesting these tickets? Well- What grounds? Where do we even begin? Oh, yeah. On many grounds, Your Honor. Many, many grounds. Yes. And let the record show that we are waiving our right to an attorney. Just explain to me why you feel you should not have been issued these tickets. Okay. Um, yeah. Well, I think in order to do that, we should probably start at the top of the story. I know what the story is. Oh, all right. It was game five of the World Series, and we actually had tickets. Needless to say, I mean, we were pumped.  [Hard Rock]  [Continues] World Series, baby! Oh, yeah! Hey-oh! What's up, fellas? What's going on, man? Not wearing any colors? Not supporting the team, dude? Wearing colors? Why the hell would I be wearing colors to Oh, my God! Today's the World Series! I totally forgot. Oh, wait a second. What's this? [Charlie Cackles] You didn't forget! Boom! I didn't forget a "thang"! This is one of the few times where it is acceptable to be shirtless in a public forum. So I'm blasting bare chest the whole time. What do you think?
 Smart.
 I think you're gonna be cold as shit. I'm not gonna be cold at all 'cause I'm gonna be wasted on grain alcohol. Grain alcohol. Whenever there's a potential riot, I'm getting blasted on grain alcohol. Riot juice! It's like rum punch! Put some of that on my bug bites. We're not gonna be wasting our fine grain alcohol on your goddamn bug bites, idiots! Yeah. We need it for pregaming. I am not watching this game sober.
 No. What? Do you want to remember it?
 Charlie, come here. Back to back. Back to back? Okay. What's going on with you guys, huh? Oh, we got bed bugs, dude. Oh, man. The place is infested with them. Some guy brought them back from Haiti. World Series, bitches! What is up? Oh! # Whoomp, there it is Whoomp, there it is #. Plan's still on, right? Oh, shit yeah, baby girl. Plan is on. Hey! Time out. There's a plan?
 There's always a plan, buddy.
 Why didn't you tell me about this? What's the plan? Okay, in the bottom of the ninth when the Phillies are up by, like, 50 or 60 runs, Dennis and I are gonna start beating the shit out of each other. Which will attract the attention of Security. Yeah. And that's when I run on the field and kiss a player. Oh!  Whoomp, there it is Whoomp, there it is . And I will toss on Green Man and run around the field
 No.
 And go crazy as Green Man. No, no, no, no, no. Whoomp, there it goes. Don't toss on Green Man because in this particular case, the Philly Phrenetic really reigns supreme, okay? We're talking about the Phillies here. Leave that for other shit.
 Are you kidding me?
 Dude, people love that guy.
 We love him. I don't love him! I'm sick of him! He's got a stranglehold on the Philly mascot scene. It's not fair! I got a pretty good thing going with Green Man. I don't see why there can only be one mascot. No. I feel like there's only room for one green idiot running around making an asshole of himself. Whoa. I can't find the tickets.
 What are you talking about?
 I don't have the tickets in my pocket!
 [Charlie] What, dude?
 Nowhere. I know exactly where I left them. I left them on the coffee table in the apartment. We don't have time to go back. We're not gonna get a good spot for the tailgating!
 We gotta go back and get 'em.
 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Dennis, Charlie, why don't you go to the parking lot, get us a good spot.
 We'll go get the tickets.
 All right. Let's move, man. I can't believe I forgot the tickets. Jesus Christ, Frank. I don't know. All I'm doing is, like, just making the sandwiches. By the way- Shut up! Okay, I think it's important to figure out which player I want to kiss when I thrust myself out on that field. I'm going Shane Victorino right now. Flyin' Hawaiian. Flyin' Hawaiian. Strong choice. But center field- way too far. You'll get jacked out before you get anywhere close. Oh. Oh! [Gasps] Balls! Oh, no! They're fumigating the building for bed bugs. How did you not know that they were bug bombing your apartment, bro? I can't read every flyer that gets slipped under the door! Jesus Christ. Well, now what are we gonna do?
 Well, I don't know. We gotta go-
 Go get the tickets! Hurry up! I'm not going in there! That's full of toxic smoke. We'll go buy gas masks. We don't have time for gas masks! Frank, come on. It's not that poisonous. Just go really fast.
 Shit. All right.
 [Mac] Jesus Christ. [Coughing] [All Coughing] Oh, God!
 My eyes are burning!
 Now what? All right. Fine! I'll have to scale the building, cut a hole in the tent, smash through the window. That'll cut down on occupancy time. You are not capable of doing that. I absolutely have the upper body strength to accomplish that. Are you kidding me? Goddamn it, Dee! Goddamn it! Will you shut up? I'm calling the boys to tell 'em we're gonna be late. They're doing that right now? All right. Keep me posted. Shit. What's up, man? Bro, they are bug bombing your building right now. They got the whole thing tented. Oh, my God! Those guys can't get in there to get the tickets. There's no way they're gonna. That's poisonous gas, dude. You can't breathe that. Screw 'em, right? What are you suggesting? Maybe we sneak into the game? I want to get into that game. I don't even want to tailgate anymore, bro. Oh, you're right! We gotta sneak in. All right. We're gonna sneak. How are we gonna sneak in though, bro? Security's gonna be crazy. There's a couple ways you can do it. One, we can take the secret tunnel that goes from the Ollidy lnn into the stadium. Stop. Stop, stop, stop. There's no secret tunnel going from the stadium to the Ollidy Inn. What the hell are you talking about? This is common knowledge, bro. There is. They built a secret tunnel so that the visiting players can get safely back to the hotel without the Phillies fans hammering them. We're passionate fans. Passionate fans. We gotta hammer something. So they got a tunnel for that? Wow. Don't you think there's gonna be security there too? There might. All right. You know what? I got it. We're gonna do a Charlie One-Two, all right? You're gonna do this, okay? Okay. One, you jump in front of a car coming into the stadium. Two, you say, "I'm gonna sue you if you don't give me tickets." No! No! That is a terrible plan. How is that terrible? Because it involves me getting hit by a car. You'll be fine, bro. You're drinking riot punch, man. You'll bounce off that thing. It's called the Charlie One-Two. You do it. Well, no. I've done too many, man. The next one could be my last. I don't want to get hit by a moving car. You'll be fine! This is the World Series, man. I don't want to do any more, dude. I could die. You do it. All right, goddamn it. I'm gonna do it. Let's do it! Last time. One last time. Too shitty, right? Crappy car. Yeah. No, you don't want to jump out in front of a shitty car. We need rich people tickets. Rich seats. Oh. Ooh. This guy right here. This is a good one. This is gonna be a good one, dude. He's gonna have such good seats. Go, go, go! Go! What are you doing, man? Bro, that guy was gonna have great seats. Yeah. I felt like I didn't have a good angle. What do you mean? I might go this way. You just jump right out in front of him. This guy'll have good seats. Don't get cold feet on me. Jump out in front of this guy. I'm fine. This guy's good. [Screaming] Your Honor, so my friend here pushed me in front of a moving car. No big deal. Ladies and gentlemen of the court, these were dire times, and dire actions were needed to get those tickets! But we didn't get the tickets, Charlie, because the guy saw you push me in front of his car. Yeah, that's true. We didn't get the tickets. So you guys tried to scam your way into the game by throwing each other in front of cars with the hopes of extorting tickets from the drivers. Let the record show that the three of us do not condone the actions of the two of them. The record will show everything. You can stop saying that. Are you sure? 'Cause she's not typing very quickly. [Frank] It's shorthand. She's getting the gist. I don't appreciate being paraphrased. I choose my words very deliberately.
 Get back to your case.
 Okay. So anyway, the three of us are back at their apartment trying to get the tickets, and Mac is scaling the building. [Grunts] Well, it's just I couldn't get a good grip, you know?
 Is it the grip? Is the grip the problem?
 Hey, you guys. Look, I found this garden hose. All right? I'm gonna use it to pump fresh air into the building and breathe into it like a scuba diver. That actually seems like it could work. Yeah. Let's give it a shot. I'll try it out. Okay. I'll go- Yeah. [Grunts] Go, go, go. [Groans] Okay. How is it? [Muffled Shouting] What? I'll get- Yeah! You're in? World Series, here we come! All right! Pregame! Pregaming! Let's pregame. All right, Dee. Let's get back to this player selection conversation, okay? 'Cause I got some- got some thoughts. Yeah, I've been thinking about it. Ryan Howard, right? Mmm. [Groans] What? Look, if it's me, I'm going Chase Utley 100% of the time. He's a power-hitting second baseman. Do you know how rare that is in the National League? And he's hot, which is number one on my list. Of course he is. But I really like Ryan Howard. You're kissin' Chase Utley, and that's it. Why are you pushing Chase Utley on me? It's starting to get weird. Okay, look. I have a plan, all right? And it involves you getting this letter to him when you get out there to kiss him. I have given this to Major League Baseball, his lawyer, his manager, his mom, and he has not gotten back to me, which means he hasn't gotten it yet. So just- Okay. What is in this letter? That's none of your business, all right? Just get it to Chase. Did you write a love letter to Chase Utley? Is that In a lot of ways, yes, I do love him, but that is not a love letter in the way that you're thinking of it, okay? There's nothing sexual or- Okay. That sounds good. I'm gonna read it. Pal around and- Yeah, read it! "Dear Chase"- Oh, shit! There's stickers! Yeah. My God. Oh, this is good. You gotta jazz it up. Yeah, you sure do. You sure do. I want to make it pop. "Dear Chase, I feel like I can call you Chase because you and me are so much alike." Really? "I would love to meet you someday. "It would be great to have a catch. "I know I can't throw as fast as you, but I think you would be impressed with my speed. "I love your hair. You run fast. "Did you have a good relationship with your father? "Me neither. "These are all things we can talk about, and more. [Mouths Words] I know you have not been getting my letters because I know you would write back if you did." "And I hope you write back this time and we get to be good friends. I am sure our relationship would be a real home run. " [Imitates Hitting Ball]
 [Snickering]
 [Chuckling] Well, if you- if you read it out of context There's no right context. [Whistles]
 Strike that from the record, please!
 No, leave that on the record.
 That one stays on the record.
 Can we get back to your case? Let's move on, huh? Shall we move on? We're gonna move on. Sorry about that, Your Honor. Whoo! My God! Wow! Wow. Okay. Okay. [Laughing] Hey, what were you hoping to accomplish with this? I'm hoping that he reads the letter- Uh-huh. And realizes that he's always wanted a younger brother. Younger brother? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! That guy's, like, five years younger than you. You know that, right? Is he really? Are you kidding me? He seems- Yeah- Oh, shit!
 The hose is gone. Oh, God.
 Oh, shit. He's in there breathing the poison. We gotta get those tickets. I gotta get to Chase! Goddamn it. Okay, hold on. [Inhaling] Oh, the poison is so thick! Oh! Oh! This hallway is really bad! There he is! Run! Get him! Frank! Frank! Frank! Hey, where are the tickets? [Groaning] Where are the tickets? Leave me here to die!
 No, come on! Where are the goddamn tickets?
 I don't know where I can't find 'em. I'll find them! I left 'em on the coffee table! Get 'em! The bug bomb bastards took 'em! [Loud Groaning] Oh, God! [Coughing] [Gagging] [Gagging] [Frank Grunting] [Groans] Hey. Yo! How are you feeling, buddy? I'm in a great deal of pain, Charlie. I was just blasted by a car. Yeah, I know. You got creamed, but check it out. I got you a soft pretzel dog! Screw your goddamn soft pretzel, you son of a bitch! I might be bleeding internally! Dude! That's the Philly Phrenetic up there, man! Maybe I'll go talk some shop with him! A little Green Man! He can get us in the game, dude! Ow! [Gasps] The Phrenetic! Yo! Hey! Hey! [Laughing] Whoo! Whoo-hoo! Philly Phrenetic! Philly Phrenetic! Huge fan, man! Seriously. Big time. Are you serious? Do you mean that? Ha-ha! Bring it in, man. Bring it in. Ah, yeah! All right. Now, seriously. Man to man, mascot to mascot, I was wondering maybe if you could help get me in the game, you know, maybe hook me up with a Green Man routine. We do it at the stadium together. So All right, now- I'm trying to talk to you, dude. I'm trying to have a conversation with you, you're belly bumping me. All right. I'll give you All right, don't big league me now here, man. Don't big league Look, I'm trying to have a conversation with the man behind the mask! I feel like you're big leaguing me, dude! Are you taking me seriously? [Blows Raspberry] [Car Radio: Man Rapping] # Now it's time for a brother to get on the mike #  And this mother party hype  Yeah! That guy's beating on the Phrenetic. Dude, is that a hate crime? Nah, it's not a hate crime. You want to hammer his ass anyway? Definitely.  Let me hear you say whoomp, there it is   Whoomp, there is it  Guys! What are you doing? [Charlie Grunting] # Whoomp, there it is Whoomp, there it is #  Louder Whoomp, there it is . Yo, Dennis! Yo, bud! Where you going, dude? Ow! Goddamn it! What happened to you? Charlie pushed me in front of a goddamn car. That's what happened.
 You look terrible.
 Why are your eyes all filled with blood?
 On account of the poison.
 Dude, where were you going? We gotta get in the stadium. Look, it's starting to get packed. Just forget about it, okay? It's impossible to get into that stadium. Trust me. Take my word for it. No, that's not good enough! We've gotta get in so Dee can kiss Chase Utley and Well, how the hell are you planning on getting in there, Mac? Uh- You put me on the spot! First thing that comes to my head, scaling the facade. I know I soured on that earlier, but I believe that is my mind telling me I have it in me! I hate to tell you this, bro, but you do not have the core strength to scale the facade of Citizens Bank- you just don't. What? I work out all the time! You only work out your glamour muscles, and you know it. I work out my core! No, you do not work out your core. You're totally arm heavy. You're all bi's and tri's. And everything else is just fat and ribs. Bro, I can do way more push-ups than you, and that's like 16 different muscle groups. That is beyond retarded, what you're saying right now. I can do way more push-ups than you even though I was just hit by a car. One, two, three, four, five Six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11- All right, enough!
 Stop it!
 All right. But you get my point, Your Honor, and you could see that Mac was slowing down at the end there. What? And let the record show that that is because he only works out his glamour muscles. No, that's- That's bullshit! I did, like, three more than you! Yeah, but you were- I wasn't slowing down. Put that on the record! Strike that from the record. I don't think you did three more.
 Oh, no! You saw it! She saw it!
 I need this story [Charlie] Sustained. To come to an end soon. Okay. Fair enough, Your Honor. I will bring this story to a close very soon. Okay, so- Let me pick up where we left off. We were at the parking lot, and I had just punched him in the face for cheating like he just tried to do right here in the courtroom. Stop handing me papers. [Mac] Why did you hammer my nose, bro? I hammered your nose because you disqualified me for no good reason. Because you had bad form, dude! What are you talking about? You were slowing down, and you just tried to- That's bullshit. I got hammered so hard! Yeah? Well, you deserve it, asshole! Charlie, who hammered you? Just some overly passionate Phillies fans. Who do you think? You getting hammered by Philly fans is reminding me of something. There is a secret tunnel between the stadium and the Ollidy Inn. I know, dude! I was telling this guy about the tunnel! No! That's not true. They built it 'cause Phillies fans hammer people all the time! That's a known tunnel. They gotta get the players out! It's underground. Everybody knows about the tunnel. Let's give the tunnel a shot. Well, let's get in! We've got nothing to lose. It's starting. You hear that shit? I hear it. Is that- It seems like it's gonna rain. Don't ever disqualify me again for a bullshit reason, or I'll hammer you again. Was your form off? Try to look inconspicuous. Inconspicuous? We all look like we've been in a terrible fight, Frank. Everybody in here looks like they've been in a terrible fight. These two ladies are in the middle of a terrible fight right now. Phillies fans are brutal. There's the elevator. Go! Go! All right. Which way is it, dude? Which way? Uh, let's try this way. The game is about to start, and this damn thing is not giving me a signal. Damn it. I don't know if I'm on board with this plan, man. I might just go up to the hotel bar and watch it up there, then join the riot afterwards. Maybe you're right. If we can't go to the game, we should be able to watch it somewhere. We're getting in the game, all right? [Dee] Just hurry up. All right, hang on a second. This looks good down here. Bingo. Look at this little room. This has got to be something, right? All right. Here we go. It's a linen closet, Charlie. Yeah. They want you to think it's a linen closet, Frank! All right, check behind the shelves and shit. Why? In Scooby-Doo, secret tunnels are always behind shelves. There's gonna be one. Could we not base our decisions on what does and doesn't happen in episodes of Scooby-Doo? Goddamn it! Let's get up to the bar before the game ends! Yeah, let's go. Come on. Oh, shit. It's locked. What? What do you mean, it's locked? It's locked! Help! Hey! Somebody help us! Guys! Check this out.
 No!
 [Laughing] Holy shit. Is it really? This is the way. [Charlie] Hang on. It's dark in here. But it sounds like it's a tunnel. [Frank] It's dark as hell in here. [Dee] I can't see anything. [Mac] It stinks. [Dennis] Awful. [Charlie] Hang on. Hang on. I found a light. [Screaming] [Screaming Continues] No, no! [Screaming] No, stop it! No! Uh-uh! No! Are you telling me you all found a dungeon at the bottom of the Ollidy Inn? No. No, no. No, no. Not really. I just added that last part at the end there to spice the story up 'cause if I'm being honest, it kind of seemed like we were losing you for a bit. Yeah, you weren't paying attention, but- But now you are. But the point is, we did get stuck in that linen closet for six days. Yes, we did. And as you know, there was a rain delay on the game. We missed the game. We missed the riot. We missed the parade. We missed everything. Yeah. And the only way we got out is some maid came after six days to get fresh towels. Yeah. How does the hotel not run out of towels for six days? Let the record show that we question that hotel's sanitation procedures. Absolutely. [Frank] It's a filthy place. And while we were stuck in that tiny little room for six days, surviving only on sink water and peppermint candies and what little bit of riot punch we had left at that point, my car accumulated the massive amount of parking tickets that brings us before you today. So I submit to you that not only should I be excused of those parking tickets, but I think, um, we're really owed compensation for the entire ordeal. Compensation. Because we went through some shit!
 Is that it?
 [Dennis] Um I think that about covers the bases, yeah. Because I do not find that your story excuses your behavior. In fact, it actually seems like you committed a litany of additional crimes in the process. I order you to pay the original fine. Next case! I didn't want to do this, but I'm gonna have to I'm calling kangaroo court on this one! A kangaroo court! It's a kangaroo court. I'm calling kangaroo court because And you know what? I'm gonna toss in my countersuit. Uh, Charlie Kelly versus Major League Baseball A countersuit, Charlie? And the Philly Phrenetic. Don't do it, Charlie. I'm mad that this guy. He's got a stranglehold Oh, boy. Look what's happening. On the mascot scene. First of all, I had to call him the Phrenetic. His name's the Phanatic. But I'm gonna get sued by Major League Baseball if I call him the Phanatic. And let's talk about steroids! Can we talk about steroids? Can we talk about steroid abuse? It's bullshit! It's ruining the game! It's ruining it! [Door Slams] [Voices Speaking Backwards]                      
 Come on Hulk!
 Get em Hulk! Come on, Hulk! I have a question though. What's going on with Hulk Hogan's hair? It's blond and yet it's silken, like that of a Chinese man. Ah yes Uh, that is Hulk Hogan's signature's look. Blonde, Chinese hair And skin of a hot dog. It's awesome. The whole thing's fake, but it's really awesome. Fake? What the hell are you talking about, fake? It's not fake. Those guys got bashed and bloody. I seen guys get pounded in the ring.
 It's still fake, no dude.
 Charlie, Charlie I was there once, I saw a guy pick up a trash can Smash it into a guy's head. Blood went everywhere. Okay, what is going on here? Ohhh Yeah! Right here he's going into a state of 'Hulkamania'. Okay, when he's like this, nothing can hurt you. It's like a seizure of strength. Who we got here? Hey sexy! I can't get you out of my mind.
 Who's that addressed to?
 It's
 Who's Soldier of Fortune? It's just this guy I been chatting online with.
 Damn it. So that would make you Desert Rose.
 Yes it would.
 [Snort] Wow! What a couple of losers! Ohhh! Oh really Okay well This loser that you are referring to happens to be an American soldier in Iraq. Back it up. Don't Don't joke about that. Are you serious? In seriousness, this platoon is coming home his weekend. And we are going to hang out together. So suck on that.
 I feel terrible.
 Yeah, you should. I feel terrible too because he's going to come back from Iraq and he's going. Gonna find out that he's been chatting with And thenThat's no good Nooo I mean High suicide rates for this guy. He's going to be crushed. I think this is emblematic of a bigger problem guys. I don't think people are proud to be Americans anymore. You know, not like we were in the 80's. On the 80's we were so patriotic. Oh man! And when Hogan was doing his thing, and we were killing Iranians, or whatever I mean we were proud! There's no fanfare. There's no parade.
 Girls are tricking troops on the Internet.
 Nope! Nobody is tricking anybody! You know? We gotta do something about this. Cus Cus People just aren't showing their appreciation for these guys. We gotta show them the love. We gotta do something. Let's step it up! Let's be the guys that do something for the troops. Let's put on a show or something. For reals. Something with a little A little pa-zass. Like a thank you.
 Yeah!
 For all your service. Something to celebrate the troops. Celebrate American. Maybe celebrates us. I'm into that. I know you are dude. Huh. What's the best way to celebrate America boys? Wrestling.

And then I pick up the trash can And I, smash the guy on the head. Oh That's gonna be a disaster. No, no, nobody's gonna get hurt. I'm telling you, like you said It's all fake. But it has nothing to do with the troops, Frank. A sixty year old man eating trash, who wants to see that? Nah, but that's what people want. Hey I got something for you. I got a character for you. You can be The ref. I'm not gonna be the ref. I'm a villain, don't you see? Pick up the garbage and then I uh.

Alright, let's get this Let's, let's Let's get back to it Just Charlie. So we're talking about the entrances okay? Yeah, we got a good idea. Okay. We got a good idea. Alright now, they are going to announce our name: Birds of War. Oh, I loved that name. I love it. And yeah, maybe we'll do an eagle screech.. *Screeching* That'll be great. And then we'll start out.. We'll come out of the tunnel, we'll start out. We're gonna write this great song. It's gonna be how bad ass we are. You know what I mean. It's all about the About how we soar through the air, how we live in a nest top. How we like to protect our eggs from predators. And our young, we regurgitate to our All the Actually, can I stop you guys for one second? Because what you just described, Nah, it seems like we're just singing About the life style of an eagle. Yeah. Okay, well I was under the impression that we were presenting ourselves as bird men. Which, to me Is infinitely cooler than just sorta being a bird. No No No It's good We can meet in the middle thou We can maybe Maybe It's just already the middle That's all I ask, that's all I ask I want people to be able to see that we're not just birds. Thanks you for stepping in as Desert Rose. Uh, no problem. I dated a lot of disable men in my past, so I enjoyed the power. Okay Why aren't you wearing red? I was very specific about that.
 I don't' do red.
 Well, you look like a grape. Fine, then I'll be Desert Grape. No, he wasn't talking to Desert Grape, He was talking to Desert Rose, it's very specific and Alright, you know what, alright, this is what we'll do, just put this here.

I thought there was a wheelchair and you were in it. Oh no, no I I twisted my knee getting of a plane in Germany. I'm uh. I was just trying to stay off of it. Mmm, it's good now, you see? Yes it is. Can I talk to you for a sec? I'll be back. What is it? What, what? I changed my mind, so move out of the way so I can swoop in. Nah Uh

I was looking around, I was thinking I I brought some You just I'm sorry for that. You just I just props I thought I was bringing. That is not a prop though, that's sharp razor wires. Mr. Manic, we were thinking that maybe we could go a little more traditional with it. You know just, figure 4 leg lock, pile driver Hey, off the top suplex Oh, no no People, that old school bullshit That, that don't play no more you know.
 Really?
 Yeah, it's gotta be gruesome, you know? Those people, they like blood you know and Yes, well guys like you You know what, I love you guys man You know, you remind me of my kids Oh, you got kids Maniac? Nah, not anymore. What does that mean?

A pile of laundry Look at this dude, that's just a bucket of chestnuts. What, is he just foraging for his food? I don't know why the hell would you have a bucket of chestnuts, bro? We are dealing with a legitimate maniac now. That is clear to me, his mania is not confined to the ring. No, he kept calling you the N word earlier. Yea, I didn't, I wasn't gonna bring that up, I don't' want to freak him out. Me? Yes, Yes. He was calling me the N word. Every time you turned your back. He's like you stupid N, go get me grease.
 And this and that.
 Why? I don't' know, did he say why? He has a problem with Black people and he likes to Why does he have a problem with me? I mean I don't understand. Both, I think Oh my god, okay. Let's get rid of him. Let's get rid of him, thats it. How you get rid of a guy like that? I don't want to be anywhere in the ring with that guy. You know what? What if we were just hype men? We don't even go in the ring. Yes, we let him do the wrestling.
 We do not wrestle?
 No. Alright, we gotta find someone for him to wrestle though. Right right. Okay. Someone who has like You know nothing to lose, right?
 Cricket.
 That's out Cricket.
 Yeah.
 Cricket. No. What do you want? What do you want from me? We want you to wrestle at a wrestling match that we're gonna throw. No, how about that? I'm not gonna participate in your little games and schemes. Cricket, how about this? It's for the troops. I don't give a shit about the troops.
 We'll gonna pay you, bro.
 That's pay involved. Oh, you should have thought about that, Cricket.
 You paying?
 Oh, yea man. Oh I see, so what, am I gonna get my ass kick? It's wrestling, it's all fake. It's relatively fake. What happens in the ring, happens in the ring, Cricket. It's really up to you. I don't feel we're reading as eagles. No bro, we look like assholes. It didn't turn out the way I had envisioned. I'm getting more of a chicken vibe.
 What in gods name is this about?
 Alright, alright, don't start We're Bird Man, we're Birds Of War.
 Bird-Men?
 What do you want? What do you want? Okay uh, I wanna sing the star spangle banner before the match. Yeah, good sing. We don't' care. Do whatever you want. Just get away. We obviously in the middle of something. Get away. Get away. Yeah.

Ahh ahhh ah, cos we're Birds of War now! But we're also mans! Birds of War! They are not responding to the pageantry at all. The new second verse is completely ridiculous. The second verse is necessary to clarify

 The microphones are on.

 Do the routine.
 Go! The crow thing, the crow thing No no cut it, cut it. Not that one, I'm not doing that one. Flip the tape over, the other song. This one goes out to a very special soldier. A Soldier of Fortune.

 Stop, you got me.
 The Trash Man! Oh shit, are you okay Cricket? I must had an itch. I knew this shit wasn't fake. Sync, transcript, spellcheck by Ikatic                     Hello. Charlie Kelly here, local business owner and cat enthusiast. Is your cat making too much noise all the time? Is your cat constantly stomping around, driving you crazy? [Roaring] [Glass Shattering] Is your cat clawing at your furnitures? [Growling] Think there's no answer? You're so stupid! There is. Kitten Mittens. Finally, there's an elegant, comfortable mitten for cats. [Crickets Chirping]
 [Cat Yowls]
 I couldn't hear anything. Is your cat one-legged? Is your cat fat, skinny or an in-between? That doesn't matter, 'cause one size fits all. Kitten Mittens. You'll be smitten. So come on down to Paddy's Pub. We're the home of the original Kitten Mittens. Mee-ow! [Button Clicks] So, lately at night, I've been forced to fall asleep to the deafening sound of, like, a hundred alley cats tapping on my windows, trying to get in. You know what I mean? Thus, Kitten Mittens. Right? I'm making a quieter cat. And then I made the sales tape when I heard about the merchandising convention.
 Ooh, question.
 Mac, go. Thank you. Uh, what merchandising convention? They're having one down at the Sheraton. All right? So I figured, what a better place to, like, find investors for my product. What do moronic Kitten Mittens have to do with our bar? Okay. One, they're not moronic. They're awesome. [Dennis] Mmm. And two, uh, nothing. Look, Charlie, I kinda like this. I might jump in on this with you here. I think it's a good idea. We could do T-shirts. We could do beach towels, those nudie pens. [Laughs] Okay. It's about time, you know, we get some merchandise in here, and I start making some money off this place. What? What are you talking about? You're not gonna make any money of this place. You don't own a piece of the bar. No, but I own a hundred percent of the merchandising. It's in my contract. What contract? The contract you had me sign when I first started working here. What? [Scoffs] [Laughs] Dee, we got you to sign that contract so we could pay you less than minimum wage. Okay? We're never gonna merchandise anything in the bar. But now we are. To be honest, I don't even remember signing any kind of contract. Oh, you don't remember? Did it slip your mind? That's okay, 'cause it's right here. I keep it in this drawer so that you two jerks don't try Hey, hey! Wait! What are you doing?
 Oh!
 You son of a bitch! That doesn't nullify it, you know? Oh, why? Do you have another copy? I don't. I don't, but you can't just go eat a contract!
 He just did eat it.
 All right. I'm talking to a lawyer about this. You don't have a leg to stand on. Yeah, go ahead. Yeah! This is making me think maybe I should slap a patent on my Kitten Mittens before you guys try and steal that too, huh? I can see it in your eyes. You're all over this, aren't you? [Swallows] You know, I gotta say, Mac, my instinct to steal this idea is very strong. Kitten Mittens? No, idiot. Merchandising in the bar. Yeah. I'm thinking we take this merchandising convention as an opportunity to make merchandise for Paddy's. Right. You know? Like, expand our brand. You know? Make a little "mon-ay"! Who's gonna buy merchandise to a bar that they've never been to? Uh, hello, Frank. [Chuckles] I've never been to Fiji. All right. Well, how about, like, hard-boiled eggs from Paddy's Bar? Green eggs. Says "Paddy's" on them. You keep them on your desk when you go to work. Who's gonna want to keep a hard-boiled egg on their desk at work? Oh, all right. Then you put it on your dashboard of your car. It's just a jumping-off point. Frank, keeping hard-boiled eggs on your desktop or the dashboard of your car is not a jumping-off point. Get the hell out of here, all right? Let us concentrate on doing the merchandising idea. Clearly you don't get it. So I don't want- I don't get it? You don't get it! I don't get it? You don't get it! Oh, yeah? We'll see who doesn't get it! Okay! Yeah! All right! All right, Charlie. Remember, this lawyer is not a big fan of ours. So we're probably gonna have to turn the charm up a little bit in the beginning. Know what I mean? I got a plan on how we can do that too. See this picture of his wife right here? Mm-hmm. What if we compliment her good looks? That gets us off on a good foot, right? Are you kidding me? That woman looks like a stone-cold bitch, and you know it. And he knows it 'cause he turns the picture away from him. Well, I'm trying to make lemonade here. Oh! Ooh, there he is. How did you get in here? Hey! Aw, we just There's the man! The old-fashioned way- with doors and feet and walking. You know, we were just having a conversation about how lovely your wife is. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Very lovely. I was not participating in that conversation, 'cause I don't find her lovely. I think you're better than that. I think you can do better than that. And I mean that as a compliment. You are aware that there are other lawyers in Philadelphia? But the three of us have a history. Sure. We, uh- We have a past, if you will. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And Charlie and I really like the fact that you don't charge. I do charge. Okay? You don't pay. We're both men of the law. You know? We get after it. You know? We jabber-jaw. We go tit for tat. We have our little differences. But at the end of the day, you win some, I win some, and there's a mutual respect left over between us. No. Any respect that you're feeling that's coming from me is a mistake on your part. Then I'll just regress, 'cause I feel like I've made myself perfectly redundant.
 Yes, you have.
 I'm lost. So I'm just gonna get down to brass tacks. I got a question for you. Does a legal document hold up in a court of law if it has been ingested by the other party?
 I'm not-
 Now, mind you, the heretofore document had- had dry ink on it for at least many "forknights," uh, hereto- We signed it a long time ago. It was a long time ago signed. I'm also gonna need a patent for the Kitten Mittens. I'm sure you do. I was gonna ask you, "Hey, need Kitten Mitten patents?" That's them. I'm sorry, sir. But they locked me in a closet. Yo, dude, dude, dude. I'm ready to show you my idea. Me too. All right, let me go first, bro. Let me show you mine, then you can go first. Then I'd be going second. Yeah, great. Okay, now listen. When we're selling stuff at Paddy's, I think we need to be selling a certain attitude, right? One that reflects our take-no-prisoners, rock-and-roll lifestyle. Okay. Yeah? Yeah. Now what says that more than this? Huh? Paddy's thong, dude! Paddy's thong! You're wearing women's underwear? Yeah, bro! You bet your ass I'm wearing women's underwear. What's more sexual than a high-waisted thong riding high up a woman's backside? Nothing. Dude, come on. Paddy's thong is gonna be a huge hit with chicks. Okay. All right. Uh, question. Yeah, Mac. Go. Dennis, are women gonna wanna buy their underpants in a bar? No. Women will not buy their underwear in a bar, but men will buy the underwear for their women in a bar because it's not for women, it's for men. It's a visual stimulant, bro. I'm not wearing these because I'm comfortable. I'm wearing them because I want to turn you on. You know what I'm saying? You get it? Yeah. Yeah, bro. It's visual stimulation. Okay. Yeah. Can I go now? Yeah, sure. I've been waiting for a long time. Okay. Okay, I'm thinking to myself, what do people love more than anything else in the world? They love comedy! They do love comedy. Everybody loves comedy, right? So- And I'm funny. I can do funny. But you gotta have functionality with your comedy, okay? Right. You can't just go throwing jokes around willy-nilly. Oh. So I did one of those. You drew a men's buttocks on a towel. Yeah. You get out of the shower in the college dorm. They got the butt, right? People are laughing. Okay. Your buddies are laughing. [Laughing] And then you give them one of these. Boom! [Laughs] Oh, that is big! That's a big monster dick. That's huge. That's the biggest dick you ever seen. Yeah, that's really- That's not how you see yourself though? Now that's funny. That's funny. That is funny. Yeah, people are gonna laugh at that. But, bro, that's just the setup. What is it? For this. Ding-ding-ding! Oh, it's a baby dick. Yeah! We're gonna sell a million of these, dude. We are gonna sell a million of those, dude. We'll do black ones and yellow ones for the Asians. That is probably more Asian than anything else. Dude- Yeah. Oh, my gosh. Maybe a little bit more bush. We should set up a Web site for it. Already did it. You did? Dicktowel.com. Dicktowel.com. [Laughs] Well, you don't think I know what's going on? Huh? Oh, Jesus Christ! I don't get it? Huh? Open your mouth, bitch. What? Prepare to be blasted, bitch! Brenda! [Muffled Screaming] [Groans, Spits, Coughs] [Frank Laughs] This is my new merchandising idea. It's a gun that shoots liquor into your mouth! You threw tequila in my eye! Well, I haven't figured out how to get the tequila to come out of the barrel of the gun. But I'm working on it. What the hell does she have to do with anything? Check her out. I mean, she's gorgeous. You bring a woman with cans like that into the convention, you sell the idea in a second. So this is your plan? You're gonna go into the convention waving a gun in people's faces, throwing tequila in everybody's eyes with a big-titted woman? Duh, yeah! Frank, get the hell out of here! Your ideas are ridiculous! Okay. Okay. Suck on this, bitches. Huh? Huh? Paddy's Pub stress ball. You give this to people. They put it on their desk. And then during the day, you squeeze it when you have any tension. Right. Oh, goddamn it, Frank! That's just an egg! It's a jumping-off point. Get out! All right. Get the hell out of here! Just get the hell out of here! Don't even listen to them. You know what I'm saying? Jesus Christ. Okay, we're stealing that gun shot idea, right? Gun shot idea's awesome. You see any sign of that lawyer or his secretary? No, and I don't know why you think we're gonna catch him having an affair. I mean, the guy's wife is really hot. No, she's not. And also, why does he turn her picture away from him so he doesn't have to look at her face? Why are we in this shady motel where we saw him go in? I'm telling you, he's- he's banging that secretary. I don't know. It just doesn't add up. She's an attractive lady, you know? She's not attractive. Oh, my God! What? The woman in the room right next to him she just ate an entire sleeve of Chips Ahoy! Charlie, could you focus on the lawyer's room, please? We're not here to blackmail a lady for eating too many cookies. Did you say an entire sleeve though? An entire sleeve. That's a lot of cookies. She a big lady? [Charlie] Of course. She's a humongous lady. Yeah. Of course. Oh, shit. I see him. He's walking towards the car. He's walking towards the car! Get down! Shh! Why is he coming towards us? Get down and hold still! [Door Opens] [Sighs] [Door Closes] All right. Um, so what are you people doing in my car now? Okay, let me explain that. Uh- Yeah. We were staking you out last night- kinda spying on you. Mm-hmm. It got a little cold. It dropped down, right? It was freezing, wasn't it? Did you feel that? So we jimmied your lock and spent the night in here. Okay. Uh, so why were you spying on me all night? Because you're having an affair, and we're gonna blackmail you for your services. Okay. I hate to disappoint you, but I am not having an affair. Oh, yeah? Then why do you turn your wife's picture away from your desk so you don't have to look at her face? Why are you staying in this seedy motel? And why does it look like you've been crying all night? I'll tell you what I think. I think you feel guilty. All right, listen. If you must know, my wife is leaving me. And I have to sleep in this fleabag motel. And I am still very much in love with my wife, which makes this divorce very difficult. Thus you have the turning away of the photo and you have, you know, the crying episodes, and the what-have-you. Mmm. Sad. Okay, that's our bad. We, uh It all comes together- That makes a lot of sense though. In a different way than I thought. God, divorce is tough. The picture sort of coming together for you all? You must be all ripped up about that. So, um- Do you want to have a conversation about helping us out with our Kitten Mitten patent and I thought this contract- You know what? If, um Why don't you get out of my car? We should go now. Why don't you just get out of my car? You've had a hard couple of days. Okay, consumer, are you ready to get blasted in the mouth by Paddy's Shotgun? Yeah. One, two, three! [Gargles] Ah! Goddamn it, dude! You just cannot blast water out of a gun. The technology is just not there. They did sort of figure it out with water guns, so I don't know why Yeah, but a water gun doesn't have the same feel to it, you know? It doesn't. You want to feel the weight of a real gun in your mouth. You want to taste the metal. You want to feel the steel, man, you know? Okay, bro, new plan. Yeah. Let's just make a video, show that at the convention. Not like Charlie's video though. Ours needs to be cool. No, no, no, dude. Way cooler than Charlie's. With, like, quick cuts and awesome music and eagles flying through the air and picking up trout out of rivers and shit. Ripping it apart and eating it, you know? It's so cool. That'll excite people. Yeah. They'll want to invest. Then we'll let the brainiacs in China figure out the technology. Yeah. But the point is- is it's got to really grab people's attention. You know what I mean? All right. I did a little tweaking and
 What is that?
 Paddy's Shotgun, bro! You get blasted in the mouth! [Laughs]
 You stole my idea!
 No, no, no, Frank. We tweaked your idea. We took what was a good idea and we made it a great idea. We're also gonna get a bustier chick. No offense, ma'am. You're very busty. Your breasts are very large. But, uh, we want to go weird with it. We want to get really freakish. I would like to get your number, actually, though at some point. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Look. You can't just take somebody's idea, change the name of it and then sell it. That's the American way, bro. Yeah! Yeah. Take a look at Hard Rock Cafe. Got tweaked by Planet Hollywood. Coke got tweaked by Pepsi. Transformers got tweaked by GoBots. Our job is to step aside and let the consumer decide. Oh, yeah? Well, I'm gonna get a patent for this and sue your balls off. We're gonna get a patent too, Frank, so screw you. Kiss it.
 Knock, knock.
 Hey, friend! Hey, we got you a little something to take your mind off your current wife situation. Sandy, have a seat right here. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 This is Sandy.
 Yep, and everything's been taken care of financially. She's been briefed on the divorce. She knows all about everything that's going on. She knows all about it. And, you know, because you've been talking about the whole money thing a little bit You said that we hadn't paid you, and we felt bad about that, so we're kinda hoping that this is sort of a compensation of sorts. Sandy does that. Sandy.
 She's the payment.
 Lawyer, check out this freakish whore we found. Hey. Whoa. What the hell are you guys doing here? I came to see the lawyer to sue you for breach of contract. What's with the busty chick? We're gonna throw a patent on her and a couple of other things. Now, I see that you have a- a lovely busty woman as well. Yeah! We brought one. Well, she's a lady of the night. She's a prostitute. Don't get too excited. And she's his lady, because he's going through a messy divorce. We paid her. So we're gonna have them have some sexual relations as sort of a payment. Ah. Wow. Divorce, huh? That's never fun. Oh, yeah. No, it's terrible. He's all broken up about it. She left him- probably 'cause he cheated on her, I'm guessing, 'cause look what a cold bitch she is. She was mean to him. [Dee] It's a mess. [Charlie] He's been crying. I tell you what, buddy. I can help you out. I'm gonna toss a frame bang your way. Now here's how that works. I slip into your house one night while your wife is sleeping, and I ease into her real nice. That way, you're both cheating on each other, and she can't clean you out. [Dee] That's a win-win. Goddamn shoes. You can't run in 'em.
 [Mac] Ah, son of a bitch.
 Come on in. What- What's with the broads? You're stealing that idea too? No! No, we're not stealing Yes, you are. We're tweaking your idea. You're stealing that idea. Guys- You're stealing my idea! Can you take your ladies outside? Stop! Stop! Everyone stop! I will take care of all of your legal needs if each of you agrees to never seek my legal advice again. What? Great. For free? No problem. And, you, promise not to break into my home and rape my wife while she's sleeping. Bro, rape? I wasn't talking about raping your wife. I was talking about making love to her sweetly while she sleeps. And I was gonna do it for you, you son of a b- All right, fine. I won't do it. Great. Now we're all here. Let's get into this.
 Deandra.
 Yeah. You want to sue these guys over some sort of breach of contract thing? Yes. This one ate a contract that said I got all the rights to the Paddy's Pub merchandise.
 That never happened.
 It happened! Okay, why don't you throw out the suit if they agree to sign a contract that grants you rights for Paddy's Pub? Fifty percent? I'll take it. Deal. [Dee] Yes! What the hell you doing, dude? I'll just eat the contract later. We would also like to make a patent on Paddy's Shotgun and this very large-breasted woman who's gonna be shooting the gun into your face.
 Objection!
 This is not a court of law. Sustained! Frank, move to strike. They stole my idea! Open your mouth!
 [All Shouting At Once]
 Christ's sakes, dude!
 [All] Oh!
 Jesus Christ! [Charlie] Whoa, man! Whoa! Oh, my God! How did you get that much propulsion on the gun? I made tequila bullets, but I guess I put too much gunpowder in. New deal! We are taking that propulsion and putting it in our shotgun! No, no, no. That deal sucks. Okay. Why don't you just use both guns? That's an even better idea. Two guns! Okay. Six boobs! We're all on the same team! Okay. I like that idea. Yeah! Yeah! All right. And, you, you want a right to the cat gloves? Mittens, dude. Pay attention. So sorry, sir. They duct-taped me to the bathroom sink. How in the hell did she get out of that? I don't know. Next up, we have submission 35 a potential investment opportunity in merchandising for a, uh- a Paddy's Pub. [Frank] Yeah! You're really sweaty, man. Well, my eyes are really burning here, Charlie.
 Start again. Start-
 [Exhales] Yeah, that's good. Action, Frank. Go, Frank, now. Go. Frank, just do the- Say the line now. Let me have a drink. How about a shot? What the  This is how we do it   [Man Vocalizing] [Mac, Deep Voice] Paddy's Pub, home of the original shotgun and gun shot!  [Continues] Are you shooting me? Shoot the girls. Shoot the girls. Do shots as they were intended by blasting them directly into your mouth! [Chuckles, Coughs] Awesome! I'm wasted! But that's not all! Dick towel! [Dennis's Voice] Dot-com. Nudie pen!  All the gangbangers forgot about the drive-by 
 Egg.
 [Mac's Voice] So come on, dude! Invest in our merchandise and Get blasted!  [Ends] [Screaming] Okay. Uh, why don't we just take a break? Huh. That did not look cool. No. Well, we had to edit while we shot. You know, and we just didn't have time. God, that was terrible. Does your cat walk around too much? Does your cat make too much noise? Guess who just found some investors for Kitten Mittens! I told you! People love stupid shit! Why do you keep calling it stupid though? It's really pretty stupid. Why do you keep calling it stupid? But people are stupid too, so
 Hello!
 [Dee Shrieks] Hey, there he is! What's up, man? Hey, nice tie.
 What are you doing here?
 Congratulations on the sale. Thank you very much. Oh, you were there? Yeah. How much money am I gonna make? Do what now? Oh. The contract that you all blindly signed grants me 100% of the profits from any merchandising opportunities from your little bar. And Kitten Mittens- I own that. Dude! I had to get paid by you people somehow. Well, that's what the hooker was for! Dude! All right. TouchÃ©. You out-lawyered me there. Mm-hmm. Okay. Tell you what though. Let's split Kitten Mittens 50-50, and then you'll never see me again. Wow. Fifty-fifty? Mmm, let me think about that. How about if I never see you again because the contract that you all signed also included a restraining order? [Laughs] Which you're all currently violating. Uh, excuse me, sir. Can I see these supposed documents that you have? Why, yes. Um, in fact, I happen to have that right here. [Charlie] Ah! Yeah! [Dee] I knew it! It's still new enough to be edible. That's an edible contract! Right in your face! Really? Yeah. You know, fortunately, I made hundreds of copies of that. [Laughs] Goddamn. So, uh, why don't you all have just a nice day. Mmm. [Laughing] [Scoffs] [Laughing Fades] [Door Closes] [Paper Rustling] You can probably stop eating that now. [Voices Speaking Backwards]                       [Knocking] [Mac] Dee. Dee. Dee. Dee. Sweet Dee. Sweet Dee. Sweet Dee. Sweet Dee. [Dennis] Hey! Sweet Dee. Sweet Dee. Sweet Dee. Sweet Dee. Sweet Dee. What? Hey. Hey- Oh- What the hell is this?
 Oh, yeah.
 [Purring]
 [Dennis] Uh-oh.
 And so it begins.
 Mmm.
 What are you talking about? I got a cat. So what? Congratulations, Dee. You've begun your transformation into crazy cat lady. I didn't begin a transformation. I just- I just got a cat 'cause I wanted something to hang out with. I don't have, you know, a roommate or anything, and I don't really have anyone to talk to, so I If you listen to yourself, you would realize you're only strengthening our argument. What do you want? We need a big bowl for popcorn.
 Yeah!
 Mac and Dennis movie night! Whoosh! Tuesday night's movie night! We're doing Predator again. You guys don't have a bowl? Um We don't have a big one, no. Not a big enough one for what we need, Dee. [Clattering] All right! Be careful! Come on! These cups suck. You serious? Yeah. Oh! Bingo. Yeah, you found it. Nice. Why did you guys have to both come over here to get one bowl? It's more fun if we both come. I was gonna hold the bowl. Dennis was gonna stand next to me and make snide comments. Yeah. That's right. Oh, you look like a bird. That's one. Uh- Old. Pick a new one. You got a new one? It's an oldie but goodie.
 He comes up with good ones.
 Yeah, no. That was a good one. I don't understand why you can't make snide remarks and hold a bowl at the same time though. It doesn't make sense. You're fixating too much on the bowl aspect of it. Put it this way. If the two of us didn't come together, what if one of us were to get into a jam? Mmm. Be silly not to have the other one there. Silly? Dennis, that sounds downright dangerous. Yeah. See, you'll never get out of a jam because you got no friends. Well, you're a spinster. Mm-hmm. A lonely spinster. With a cat. [Both Giggling] Those are all funny. It's funny 'cause I feel like you guys are two codependent losers who are so wrapped up in each other that it's hard for you to see how pathetic your lives are. It's like you're an old married couple. No, Dee. We're more like a dynamic duo. So you don't think that two 30-year-old men who spend every waking moment together is a little bit pathetic? Well, we don't spend every waking moment together.
 What are you, crazy?
 You're right. I'm sorry. When was the last time you went more than an hour without seeing each other? All the time. Every day.
 Okay. Without checking in?
 Ch- Checking. That's Uh-huh. He always checks in with me. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He likes to have me check in, but it's not like Okay. Enjoy that movie, boners. [Exhales] She doesn't know anything about friendship, dude. No. How could she? She doesn't have any friends. "Old married couple." That's what she called [Both Chuckling] [Door Opens]
 Hey-oh.
 Yo, where you been? What do you mean? I was getting the movie. Yeah, but you weren't answering any of my calls. I've been calling you sort of over and over again. I was having a conversation with the video store clerk. Yeah, but I texted you 911, dude. That means it's an emergency. Yeah, I saw that. Yeah. Uh, what was the emergency, Mac? Well, I couldn't get in touch with you, dude. I almost called the police. The police? I mean, that's a bit of an overreaction. I was gone for what, an hour? Yeah, but I thought we had a deal. You know, you would check in every once in a while, and then that way I would know that you were okay. Okay. I- I'm okay. Uh, I'm sorry. Can we watch the movie? Yeah. Great. Sure. Yeah. The Transporter 2? Yeah, I- Look, man. I-I-I I know you wanted to see Predator again, but I feel like we've seen that 30 times in the last two months and thought maybe we could mix things up. Video store clerk guy said this movie's awesome, so The video store clerk guy. I feel like you won't [Chuckles] stop talking about him. Huh. I asked him for a movie recommendation, okay? Yeah. And you got one. It's really not that big of a deal. Well, the big deal, Dennis, is that I wasn't even consulted on the decision. Okay? And this is a big deal to me as well. It's also my night. Plus, Transporter 2? We haven't seen Transporter 1, which means we'll be completely lost. I doubt it. Plus Jason Statham's physique is nothing like the lineup in Predator. Okay, stop. I don't want to have conversations anymore about dudes' physiques, and whether they can Dennis, in body mass alone That's what I was trying to avoid- a conversation about body mass, okay? We've had that conversation five times a day for the last month because we keep watching Predator, and all you talk about is Weathers and-and-and Jesse "the Body" Ventura and how many pounds they can pack on. It's important to pack on mass. You're talking about carbo-loading. I don't want to have this conversation with you anymore. No. You'd rather have conversations with video store clerks. You know what, man? If you don't want to watch the movie with me, that's fine. I will watch it by myself. Goddamn it! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where is this coming from? I have been thinking a lot about what Dee said, and I do think [Exhales] maybe we are spending a little bit too much time together. Wh-What are you saying? I'm saying that I feel like we're in a little bit of a rut, and I feel like I'm not flourishing. [Clicks Tongue] Well, far be it from me to, uh, keep the flower of you from flourishing, but, uh, I guess I'll grab my shit and stay at Charlie's. Wait. Don't do that. [Exhales] I feel like I'm the one that got us into this mess. Okay. So you'll stay at Charlie's then. No. You should stay there because you already said that you would. Also, I have more stuff. It'll take me longer to pack, and it'll be easier. [Doorbell Rings] Hi. I'm responding to a missing persons report. I'll pack my things.
 [Knocking]
 Hey! [Laughing] Hey-oh! What's the matter with you? What are you doing here?
 I came to hang out with you.
 I thought it was movie night. Yeah, it is movie night. But, uh, Mac and I are taking a little bit of a break. I was thinking about what you were saying. You were right. I wasn't spending enough time by myself. I wasn't being an independent individual. I wasn't flourishing. So let's watch the movie together, you and me. [Meowing] I'm kind of in the middle of something with my cat right now. Oh. Okay. Well, yeah. I like cats. Let's bring him into the mix. Uh, can't do that. He is in the wall somewhere.
 He's in the wall?
 Yeah. I think he got into the wall. Wow. Well, that's a bummer. [Meowing Continues] But I'm sure he'll come out at some point. Got himself in there. I'm sure he'll get himself out. Or he won't, and he'll die in there, and you'll have a dead cat smell for a while. But listen, I'm gonna help you out of that jam. Open the windows and get some scented candles going, maybe get a big fan in here and then he'll decompose and everything will be fine. Boom! That's what it's like to have a sidekick. Helped you out of a jam. [Meowing Continues] In the meantime, let's watch the movie. I want to- I want to [Exhales] Just want to watch a movie with you. Could we do that? Why don't you just put your trash into a trash can? I put it in the trash can when I'm ready to take it outside, dude. Yeah, but you could skip a step by first putting it into the can. And you can shut the hell up, man. Okay. And Jesus Christ, Frank. Are you cutting your toenails with a steak knife? I suppose you have a problem with that too? Ah! Oh! Oh! Botched toe! I botched that one. Oh, that's a botch job. That's bleeding. I need some trash to plug up the cut. Do not plug an open wound with trash.
 Well, it's bleeding like a sieve.
 Then use your sock, bro. Don't waste a good sock on a tiny little cut. Sock. I'll find you a candy wrapper if you give me a second. Oh. Oh. Oh, wait a minute. That's- That's working. Oh, it's acting like a cut glove. Ah! Unbelievable, dude. Waste of a sock. There are so many things that are gonna need to change now that I'm living here. Are you hearing this shit, bro? Well, you know, he's got some good ideas. What?
 Maybe it wouldn't be bad if he moved in.
 Are you serious, dude? I could use a little structure in my life here. No, man. Look at all the trash all over the place. Oh, I love the trash. He's cleaning up the trash. Mmm [Phone Ringing] I don't want struc- [Groans] Uh- Eh- Is that Dennis? I don't know who it is. I haven't answered the phone. Are you gonna answer it though, because- Okay. Unbelievable, dude.
 I'm just gonna get it. Hello?
 Hey, buddy. How you doing? Oh, Mac is being annoying as shit. That him? Oh, Mac's being annoying? That's a big surprise. He bossing you around a whole bunch? Totally bossing me around. Yeah. Typical. It's what he does. It's what he does.
 Did he mention me?
 No. No? Really? He didn't say anything at all about me or What is this, dude? Did you call me just to talk about Mac? Okay, 'cause I don't want to talk about Mac with you. Is he talking about me?
No, no, no, no. Tell him I'm not talking about him at all.
I'm not telling him shit, dude. I'm gonna hang up the phone on you. No, no, Charlie. Don't hang up the phone. I didn't call to talk about Mac. I swear to God, dude. Please. Come on. I could care less about that guy. Are you kidding me? Called to talk to you. Wanted to see if you wanted to come over to Dee's apartment.
 We're doing a movie night.
 Charlie, hang up the phone. Oh, my God, dude. I'll be right over. Hang up the phone. Yes! Yeah! Yes! Yes. Yeah. Hey, Dee. Charlie's coming over. I don't care. Ah, shit. I don't care either. I am so excited to watch this movie without Mac. He is so annoying. He's always constantly critiquing the fight scenes and talking about how he could choreograph the fight scenes so much better than they could, which is ridiculous.
 He doesn't know shit.
 Ooh! Dennis, I pinpointed him. Dee, will you forget the goddamn cat for a second and listen to all the interesting things I have to say? You're being the worst sidekick right now. No, you're being the worst sidekick. [Meowing] I thought sidekicks were supposed to help each other out of jams. What? I did help you out of the jam. I told you what to do with your dead, stinking cat. No, no, no, no, no. Come on. Oh! I lost him. I lost him, Dennis. Thanks a lot. Oh, do me a favor. Peel this apple for me, please? No! No, I'm not gonna peel an apple for you. But Mac always does it for me. Why does Mac peel your apples for you? He doesn't like for me to eat the apples with the skin on it. He says the skin's loaded with toxins. Okay. Well, good news. Mac's not here. I know he's not here, and that's why I need you to do it for me.
 Please? Please?
 Oh, Jesus. Just eat it with the skin on it. I do not like it with the skin, Dee! I'm not allowed to eat it with the skin!
 I'm not allowed!
 Oh, my God! All right. If you just shut up, I will peel the apple for you the way that Mac likes you to eat it. Give it to me. Give it to me! I'll do it the way that Mac insists. Okay? Yeah. Hey-oh! Is that Charlie? Charlie's in the house! Charlie's in the house! Hey! Hey! Hey, you want a skinless apple, bud? Yup. Two skinless apples, Dee. Let's fire the movie up. It's movie night.
 Here's your apple, dick.
 All right. Yeah. Where's mine? Are you kidding me? Mmm. You can peel your own apple, Charlie. Mmm. She's in a little bit of a mood because her cat got stuck in the wall. Cat in the wall, eh? Okay. Now you're talking my language. I know this game. All right. Catch me up to speed here. What do we got? You're putting Cheeto fingers all over the wall. All right. Let's focus, Dee. What's the point of entry here? That's the thing, Charlie. I've been looking all around this goddamn place. I can't find one. All right. I've seen this before. You know what happened? I bet it flattened itself out, went right through a seam in your wall. I don't think there's anything in the laws of nature that would support that. Cats do not abide by the laws of nature, all right? Hey. You don't know shit about ca- We're still gonna watch the movie, right? Uh- Uh, yeah. Yeah? I think it's stuck in there. No! It is not stuck. All right. Let's focus on what's happening with the cat, all right? It made a conscious decision to go in your wall. Correct? Really? Absolutely. Absolutely. It chose to be in there. It wants to be in your wall, Dee. Thinking about getting some catnip, and I was gonna put it- No, no, no, no. Don't do that. Don't do that. It's gonna know that's a trap, Dee. Okay? That's gonna irritate the cat, then it's gonna dig itself down further. We may never get to it. Okay? You serious? Let's start thinking like a cat here. All right? You know, we- we need another cat. Yes? That's what we need. Here's what we're gonna do. I'm gonna crack a little hole in your wall- Tiny one. It'll be cool. And then I'm gonna slip a second cat in with a string tied around it. Those two will become codependent, then I'll rip the second cat out, and the first one hopefully- hopefully will follow. Hey, hey. Hey, man. Hey. I'm sorry. I don't mean to keep bugging you, but you didn't tell me what to do. I don't care. Do you want me to start it now or wait? I'll wait. Yeah. Start it. But I want to watch it with you. I will wait. Just start the movie, man, 'cause I'm having a conversation here!
 All day.
 [Mouths Word] All right. Where are we gonna get this other cat? I can get you another cat. I got followed here by, like, 10 cats. Yeah, they're starting to follow me these days. Uh-I You know, I don't want you to miss the setup. [Mouths Words] I got everything- all the groceries, no cat food. [Chuckles] And I bumped into that guy at the video store.
 Beefcake?
 Total jerk-off. [Exhales] Nice.
 Hey! This place is tits!
 Yeah, right? Looks good. Huh? You did a great job. Thank you. Whoa! Frank! No, no! Oh, God, dude! What? The skin of those things is riddled with toxins! [Groans] Yeah, get it out though. Get it all out. Yuck! [Spitting] Whoo! That was a close call. Good save. Hey, all right. Well, don't touch me with it. Hey, also- I cleaned out this closet. I'm telling you, bro, we could fit a mattress in there. You and Charlie don't have to sleep next to each other anymore. Well, I- I kind of liked the other arrangement though. That was pretty good. [Chuckles] Yeah. The other arrangement was- was not pretty good. It was, um It was, uh- What- What's the word I'm looking for?
 Crazy.
 No, it's not- not crazy. It's like
 Wackadoo.
 No. Just stop. Whoa! Wh-What- What are you doing now, dude? What? I'm taking the toxic skin off. Yeah, but you're cutting it with your toe knife.
 Who gives a shit?
 Frank, that is disgusting. What- What are you talking about? I'm throwing it out.
 Wait. You're throwing my toe knife out?
 The toe knife is gone.
 Why would you do that?
 Because you were cutting your fruit with it! What the hell's going on here? Look, Mac. I mean, look. I I think the cleaning up and the throwing the trash away is good, but the you know, the sleeping arrangements and the plastic and throwing the toe knife out the window, that's I'm not gonna put on airs just because I got company.
 So you think not eating cat food is putting on airs?
 You betcha! Look, I gotta take a walk. My head is swimming. That's fine. Just make sure you, you know, check in. Oh, my. 'Cause I haven't heard from Charlie, and it is getting late.
 Yeah, right.
 Okay. Be safe. [Door Closes] [Movie On TV, Indistinct] Okay, Dee! This little lady is a calico cat. All calico cats are female. [Meowing] I'm gonna pop this little girl in your wall here. [Growling, Hissing] She's gonna meet your little fella, they're gonna bond and then I'm gonna rip her out and he's gonna come right afterwards. Are you sure? Mm-hmm. [Growling] You hear that? Uh, I hear a squabble. Mm-hmm. It's all part of the dance, okay? [Screeching, Hissing] They do a little sq- Come on. Wait. Hold on. They do a little Uh-oh. [Clicks Tongue] Crap. Thanks a lot, Charlie. Mmm. Goddamn it. I knew I should've gotten a bird. A bird? What are you gonna do with a bird? Yeah! Hey, guys! I swallowed apple seeds! So what? Are they poisonous? Are you kidding me, dude? They're extremely poisonous! They're absolutely not poisonous! Should I make myself throw up? I would throw up now! Oh, goddamn it! Apple seeds, man? That's no good. Are you kidding me? Apple seeds- Yo! Hey. Oh, hi. Come on in. [Exhales] So, uh, how's life with Mac? I'm off him. He's too pushy. Yeah, no shit. You back on my team? If there's room for me. There is always room for you, bud. Give it to me. [Both Grunting, Laughing] [Dennis] Hey, guys! I can't throw up. Should I stick a finger down my throat? Yes! Oh, my God. You guys, we gotta- [Retching] Oh, man. We gotta get Mac and Dennis back together, okay? Because they are ruining all of our lives. What's the situation? [Retching Continues] I got two cats stuck inside this wall. Can't get 'em out. You want to bring in a third? I'm thinking maybe four.
 What? No! No! No! No more cats!
 A deep hole Frank, get out of here! You're making it worse! Whoa. Back off Frank. We work very well together, okay? We're the gruesome twosome! Gruesome twosome! [Braying, Grunting] All right! Okay! I am gonna go and get Mac and Dennis back together. I'm gonna get a bird, I'm gonna get two cats out of my wall and then I'm gonna go back to being alone. Excuse me. Can you part for one second? Sure. Thank you. Thank you. [Retching Continues] What? He swallowed some apple seeds. Sit down. What
 What-
 Sit. What is he doing here? I was told I would be meeting a woman with giant breasts. I was also told that I was to meet a woman with giant breasts. Yes, geniuses. I set you up. Now, can you please make up, because you're driving everyone crazy. Look, I'm sorry that I called you codependent, okay? I think you have a great friendship, and it's perfectly natural for two grown men to need each other this badly. So make up, please. [Sighs] I guess I should [Grunts] [Grunts] You son of a bitch! Okay. All right. Okay. Oh, my God. You know what? Fine. I don't care anymore. Guess what? Neither one of you are ever going into my apartment ever again, okay? So make up, don't make up, kill each other- I don't care. I need to go get a bird. She looks like a bird. [Chuckles] I swallowed some apple seeds today. Did you make yourself throw up? I tried, but I couldn't. Smoke some cigarettes. The smoke will suffocate the bacteria in your stomach. Okay. Thanks. How was Charlie's? [Groans] The way they live, bro, it's It's like, um- It's like- Preposterous. Yeah, dude! Preposterous! Yeah. I've been trying to come up with that all day! Yeah. God, dude! This is why you and I are such a good team. You know? Like, I'm a man of action, and you're a man that comes up with good Words? Words, dude! Okay. Yeah. Great. You really gotta work on your vocabulary though, man. Well, you could help me. You couldn't think of the word "words." Is everything okay here, gentlemen? Uh, yeah. Everything's fine. Uh, not that it concerns you. Now might be a good time for you to pay your bill and leave. Well, you're not making sense 'cause we didn't buy anything. Actually, I- Oh.
 I had a couple of rum and Cokes.
 You had six, actually. Six? I had six of 'em. Did you? Yeah. I was nervous about the big-breasted lady. I- I was nervous about her too. You got nervous too? A beautiful woman. Dee said she had giant boobs, you know? I'm really excited about it. [Clears Throat] Will that be cash or charge? I also was assuming that the big-breasted lady was gonna pay for the drinks, so I don't have any money. I've got some cash. I can- I can get you out of this jam. [Bird Chirping] [All Meowing] Watch your eyes. What? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! What the hell is going on? The gruesome twosome in effect! [Grunting, Braying] Yeah. We're bashing a bigger hole in your wall.
 We're gonna stuff all the cats in at one time.
 Yeah, I see that. No more big holes in my wall, no more cats. We're doing the bird thing. I got one. I tied a string around his teeny, tiny little legs. I'm sending it in. You're gonna toss a bird in? I'm gonna toss the bird in, Charlie.
 Go ahead, Dee. Toss the bird in.
 Check this out. Watch this. [Frank] Dinner time. Go on, guy. Do your thing. [Charlie] All right. [Meowing] Go on. You got it. [Screeching] Whoa! Hold on. Hold on. Hold on, guy. I got you. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Come on. [Meowing] [Charlie Laughs] Well, congratulations, Dee. You have some very satisfied cats in there, okay? Now will you step aside and let the men do the work? Shut up! Shut up, okay? I got it from here, all right? I'm bashing a hole in my wall. I'm going in myself. Give me this. Get out of the way. All right. I'm not kidding. Get the hell out of the way. Oh. I'm dead serious. I'm going in. I've had enough. Go for it. Bash away. Bash away. [Shouting] [Frank] Whoa! Oh!
 I'm gonna get you, you jerk!
 Yeah! Yeah, Deandra! [Panting] Come on, kitty. [Meowing] Oh. Come on. Okay. I'll get you. I'll get you. Wait- Oh. Wow! There are a lot of cats back here! Yeah. We put a lot of cats in there. [Cell Phone Rings] Oh, I'm getting a text. Ooh. Who is it? Ah, the dynamic duo in effect. Oh, they're back together! [Chuckles] Yeah. All right. They're watching Predator. You want to join? Absolutely, dude. Great. Deandra, we're out of here. Yeah. Hey, you guys? We're going. Yeah? You guys, I think I'm stuck in the wall. That's why she needs a friend. You gotta have a sidekick. That's all I'm saying. That's all I'm saying. All right- Oops. Okay, I'm trying to back out, but my shirt's caught on something. [Cats Screeching, Hissing] Guys? Guys? Guys, come on! [Voices Speaking Backwards]                       I'm only gonna be here for 10 minutes. I got to get my pump on. I have a very big day. I'm sorry. I can't let you in. I don't understand why you're insisting on jamming me up here, bro. I'm not trying to jam you up. I just don't believe you. What is not to believe? I am absolutely Dennis Reynolds.
 This picture looks nothing like you.
 Well, thank you. Because I have actually packed on since that picture was taken, bro. It's actually a testament to your gym. I'm gonna need you to either buy your own membership, or get out.
 Mac?
 Yeah.
 Hey! Tranny! Carmen.
 Yeah. Sorry. How you doing? Wow. You look great. Sweet camel toe. That's a good tuck job. You have it taped back there?
 No.
 It's good. It's actually gone. I had the surgery. Get out! That's fantastic! I thought I was gonna get a phone call after the old snip-snip 'cause we talked about that, but either way, now that you're dickless, I'm into it.
 What are you doing this afternoon?
 How's it goin'? Uh- It's goin' good, pal but, uh, the lady isn't interested. Uh, Mac, I would like you to meet my husband, Nick. Husband? You're married. Great. Now, what do you guys think? They're good almonds, right?
 They are tasty.
 These almonds? Yeah, they're fine. I found them in, like
 in a little pile in the alleyway.
 A squirrel must have piled them up and then got hit by a car.
 Why? Why, why, why?
 Why would you feed us alley almonds?
 Why wouldn't you tell us that?
 They're perfectly good.
 Guys. Guys, guys. I've got news. I've got huge news. So I went down to the gym this morning, right? I was all amped up, 'cause Charlie and I found a bunch of nuts. I was so full of protein, okay? I went to get my pump on, but I couldn't get my pump on. Now, I know what you're thinking. Clearly, I did get my pump on, but that's 'cause I just did a bunch of push-ups outside.
 Also why I'm out of breath.
 What in God's name are you talking about?
 Is this the big news?
 No. I ran into the tranny. She got her dick cut off and she married a dude.
 Oh.
 Oh, that's great! Congratulations to her.
 No, that is not great.
 No?
 That is a gay marriage.
 Uh, I got a question for you.
 One's a girl, one's a guy.
 Yeah. And how is that gay? Well, for starters, clearly, her husband is a homosexual, okay? Why are you making that assumption? Because he's with a tranny? You were with the tranny. What are you saying? No! Charlie, that is completely different, and you know it. Yeah. No. He's right. That's different, 'cause this new guy- if I'm hearing correctly
 he waited until she got her dick cut off before he banged her.
 But that means

 No. Who gives a shit if gays want to be miserable like everybody else and get married? Let 'em do it. It's no skin off my ass. No. Marriage is a wonderful thing. It's between two people who decide they want to spend the rest of their lives together because they love each other very much. I'm all for it, and I think everyone should be entitled to it. Oh, everybody up on their high horse of marriage all of a sudden. Marriage is about procreation, okay? This is gay marriage. That's two dudes banging each other. What do you get from that? Nothin'. Nothin'. Uh, that is a persuasive argument. You should take your powerful extension cord argument straight to the supreme court.
 Mm-hmm. They'll love it there.
 Run that right up the ladder, right?
 Run it up the ladder.
 Mac, dude, I think you're just getting upset that the tranny married some guy that's not you, and that's what this is about. No. No, Charlie, this is about the big man upstairs, okay, getting boxed out.
 Ah, Jesus.
 It clearly says in the Bible that gay marriage is wrong.
 And I'm gonna show you. Where's our Bible?
 "Where's our Bible?"
 Where's our goddamn Bible?
 We don't have a Bible in here.
 Why don't we have a Bible?
 We never have. It's a bar. Okay, I see what's happening here.
 I don't have enough facts to support my argument.
 Clearly. I'm gonna find a Bible, I'm gonna come back, and I'm gonna school you sons of bitches. Because you guys are trying to confuse me. You're trying to confuse me, because that's what God's work
 Ah
 Oh, he's getting himself all worked up, huh? Yeah. Very worked up. Very worked up. You know, I always thought I'd be married by now.
 What?
 What? Yeah. Well, I don't know. All that talk about marriage and everything
 It's got me thinking about myself and my situation and I guess I always thought I'd be married by now. What the shit are you talking about? Frank, I'm talking about Maureen Ponderosa. Oh, my God, dude. Don't start in on this. Maureen Ponderosa was my girlfriend in 10th grade, and we were so in love. You remember Maureen Ponderosa, right, Charlie? I remember her dead tooth, dude. What? Dead tooth? She didn't have a dead tooth. You guys remember her brother Bill
 Bill Ponderosa? Oh, that guy was like a walking cliché. He was hot. Great buns. Yeah, and I remember, every time you tried to talk to him, you'd
 I got a little gaggy. It's only 'cause he made me nervous.
 But he was very handsome.
 What is it with you two and the Ponderosas? I think I might call her up actually. Charlie, not in the corner. Put 'em in the closet, tuck 'em in the back.
 Hold on a second.
 Pick 'em up. There you go. Come on.
 Not on the floor!
 Dude, my back! Charlie, look at this. I've been saving these for years. What? I think I slipped a disk, man. Stand straight or something. Aah! Frank, I gotta go see a chiropractor again. Oh, right. I just keep paying medical bills, right? Is that it?
 I keep lugging pennies.
 Come on. You're in pain? Here, let me hit you with the two-by-four. You won't feel anything. No. I don't want to play that game anymore. All right. Crack my back.
 Can you crack my back, please?
 Crack your back. All right. Turn around. Give me that. You ready? Way up.
 Oh! Oh! Oh!
 Did you get my back?
 Oh, my back. Oh!
 I'll get you. Ow, my back! Aw! I need it again!
 Yi, yi, yi, yi, yi!
 Oh! Oh! Oh! Charlie. Charlie.
 Don't touch me.
 All right. All right. This is gonna sound crazy. I just got an idea. If we do that domestic partnership thing that gay guys can do I can totally get on your health insurance. You won't even have to pay for the chiropractor. You proposing to me? Come on, man. No. I'm saying, we're already friends, right? Let's be friends with benefits, right? Oh, yeah. You get your back fixed. What's in it for me? All right, man. There's gotta be a reason why all those couples want to do it. Uh, perks, right? Can we at least look into what goes into it?
 I really gotta see a chiropractor, man.
 We'll look into it. You got to hit me with the two-by-four. I got too much pain. It's bad on me too. All right. I got you.
 I got you. I got you.
 Hit me in the head. Hit me good. Phew! I feel really nervous, Dee. I haven't seen Maureen in, like, close to 15 years.
 I was really in love with that girl, huh?
 Yeah. No girl has ever had this effect on me, so I don't know how to deal with it. It's crazy. I know what you mean. I'm feeling a lot of butterflies myself too. It's, like, "Oh, I'm gonna see Bill Ponderosa."
 Is that gonna happen?
 Maybe bubbly water.
 Maybe if you get me some bubbly water.
 Slow down- Here we go.
 Dennis!
 Hey, Maureen! Wow. Look at you. You look amazing!
 You look amazing.
 Me? Oh. Who's this? Is this your husband?
 This is Bill.
 Hey, you guys. Bill? No
 Wow! Wow, right? I would not have guessed that was you.
 Yeah, I've gained a little weight.
 Did you now? Oh! Well, no, it's hardly noticeable. Hardly noticeable. I do notice the ring though. Oh, good for you.
 You got married. That's good.
 Yeah, 10 years now. Yeah, she's amazing.
 So are my two kids. Want to see little

 Oh! No, no, no, no, no, no, I don't. I don't really. I mean, it's great, but you know what I mean. Nobody really wants to see that. Goddamn, this has been a really fun walk down memory lane. Uh, Maureen, great to see you. And, Bill, take care of yourself or whatever people say.
 Okay. Excuse me.
 All right. Well, yeah, this has got to be a little awkward for you now, Bill, right? 'Cause you're here, and we're sort of having a
 probably gonna have a little sit-down breakfast and now you're a bit of a third wheel kind of wormed your way into our situation.
 Yeah. Not really. I just came to catch up, so

 No. But I can leave you guys alone, I guess. Yeah! Oh, yeah. That would be great. That would be great.
 Hey, take care of yourself. It was good to see you.
 I gotta pick up the kids.
 Sure, pick up the kids, yeah.
 Bye, Bill. Uh

 Hey, you want to sit down?
 Yeah. Great. Hey. God, man. Maureen Ponderosa.
 I can't even believe those words are coming out of my mouth.
 I know. Look at you. Look at you! You look great. You're still quite a catch.
 You look just like you did in high school.
 Oh. Hey, do you remember all the good times that we used to have in the back of your dad's Datsun behind this place? Oh, man. So much romance. Mmm.
 Hey, how is your dad?
 Dad died last year.
 Did he die?
 Yeah. Oh, that's- that's too bad. It happens, you know. He was getting up there, right?
 I mean, it was probably natural causes, or

 Suicide.
 Sui- Suicide?
 Car exhaust, yeah. I had to break the window of the Datsun, so
 Oh, yeah. It was one of those. One of those, huh?
 His eyes were so yellow.
 Okay. Oh! Oh, Maureen Ponderosa!
 Yeah.
 Oh, yeah! Dennis Reynolds and Maureen Ponderosa back together again at last. Hey, Carmen.
 Carmen, hey. I wanna show you something.
 Oh.
 Hey, Mac.
 Yeah.
 What's going on here?
 Good. I'm glad you're here too. This pertains to both of you guys. I am about to do you guys a huge solid. Ready? "Men with men committing indecent acts"
 sex in the butt
 "will receive the due penalty for their perversion." Word of the Lord. Okay, what is it you're trying to say, Mac? I'm saying that in the eyes of the Lord, your marriage is an abomination and if you don't get a divorce, you're going to hell. I love people tripping all the time. Can I see that for a second?
 But I'm not tripping, okay? It's all right there.
 Oh, no. It's gonna take you a little while to flip through it 'cause that book is long as shit.
 Oh, yeah. I like this one. Exodus 21, verses 20, 21.
 Mmm. "When a man strikes his slave with a rod so hard that the slave dies he shall be punished. If, however, the slave survives for a day or two, he is not to be punished for the slave is his property." That's not what I'm talking about though. That's not my thing. So you're saying you're gonna whup my black ass with a rod for as long as you like and as long as I get up after a day or two, we all good. That's what you're telling me? No, I wouldn't whup on you with anything, whether you were my slave or not. That doesn't really pertain anyway, because that section is not from the same time. Oh, oh, really? Well, what time is your section from, Mac? Look, I came here to help you guys, okay? As a gay man, there's certain things you need to know about the afterlife. I'm not a gay man. Yes, you are. You're banging a dude. Look, if anything, you're the one that slept with me when I was a man. Oh, that's it- You're gay.
 No, no, no, no, no.
 He's gay.
 No, no, no, no, no.
 If this is about you and me, then just say that. I'm never going to admit that, Carmen. But come on, I mean, him? What- What do you see in this guy? I mean, look at my body compared to his. I'm a hard body. You're a hard body. We could be hard bodies together. Not hard body and
 I thought we established that there was going to be a phone call after the procedure. And then you have the procedure, and I never got that call. Instead you called this soft body and you gay-married him. And now you're calling me gay, telling me I'm tripping and trying to confuse me with your liberal biblicisms. Man, my guess is, you've been confused for a very long time.
 All right, take it easy.
 Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho! Thank you very much. All right, dude. Okay, I admit this is more paperwork than I expected, all right? But, Frank, that's because this domestic partnership thing is really worth doing, dude. There's a lot of perks in these bad boys, you know? There's a lot of jelly in these doughnuts here, Frank. Charlie, you still haven't told me how this shit is going to be good for me. Me. It's all in here! All right. Okay. Think about this for a second. You're definitely gonna have another massive heart attack or stroke in the next few years? Definitely. What's gonna happen when you go on life support, dude? Dennis and Dee are gonna pull the plug on you so fast, your head is gonna spin. But think about this, Frank. You know who's not gonna do that? This guy right here. This thing- This is so much complicated stuff, Charlie. Look who it is. Wow! Guys, you remember Maureen Ponderosa, right?
 Charlie!
 Ooh!
 Hey! Maureen, how are ya?
 Dead tooth. Let me see the dead tooth.
 What's he talking about?
 Oh, he's- Pipe down, Frank.
 So listen, guys. We just got married.
 What? Yeah. Yeah. We're married. Maureen and I got married.
 What is wrong with you?
 It's not what's wrong with me, Frank. It's what's right with me, and that's this little piece of paper here that we just signed. It's our marriage certificate. Now we're married. Boom. Hold on a second. You just had to sign a little piece of paper? They gave Frank and I, like, a million forms for our marriage. You guys are trying to get married too, huh? That's weird.
 It's a whole

 Okay. Well, we're out of here, so good luck. Oh, my God. What is the matter with him?
 Did you smell her breath?
 Are you kidding me? It smelled like she was nibbling on little pieces of shit. Wait a second. Wait a second.
 Dennis, you're married?
 Yes, man, I'm married. I'm a married man. She's actually here, dude. It's awesome. She's in the bathroom. She's brushing her teeth. Yeah, she must have eaten something a little bit sinister. Must have been the Funyuns or something. I don't know. Whatever. It doesn't matter. Anyway, the point is, I am having
 This is crazy, but I'm having feelings again. Like some kind of 14-year-old kid or something. You remember feelings, right? Yeah. I have feelings every single day of my life.
 Do you?
 Are you saying you don't have feelings? Well, I'm saying I built up a shell
 a shell around myself. A cold, calculated, heartless shell that couldn't be broken by anything but marriage. And that's what she did, dude
 she broke that shell with marriage. In a good way, if I'm being unclear. And that brings me, actually, to my next point. I need you to move out like now, like right away. What? Why do I have to move out? It's my apartment too. Uh, actually, you know what, Mac? Turns out it's not your apartment because you never signed the lease, if you recall 'cause your credit was so bad. Oh. Well
 What am I gonna do with all my stuff? You know what? Believe it or not, I've been doing some inventory and it turns out you don't actually own anything in this apartment. That can't be true. It's shockingly true. Yeah, yeah. Every single thing in here is mine. For instance, that shirt that you're wearing right now- that was my shirt. Then I got tired of it, I threw it in the trash and then you fished it out of the trash and you cut the sleeves off it as you are wont to do, 'cause that's your thing- but whatever. Also, I don't want to rush you on this either but I did have to drop you from my cell phone's family plan. And I'm gonna need you to stop using my name at the gym because I'm getting a lot of phone calls about that, and that's a little embarrassing.
 Can I say something?
 Yeah, totally. Oh, there we go.
 Oh! How you doin'?
 Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
 No! No, no, no, no, no, no.
 You got a minute?
 You got a minute?
 Quick question.
 I'm kind of in the middle of something right now.
 Yeah, yeah. Yeah. That's easy. Okay, no problem. That's better. Why do you people keep bothering me at the gym? I'm so sorry. It's gonna be a quick question. Charlie. You remember me, right?
 Yeah. Hi.
 Frank. No, I don't remember you. My friend and I, we're trying to get a gay marriage situation going on and he's all tripped up about some issue. And now he's uncomfortable talking to me.
 I figured you're an expert, so we could talk to you.
 Fine. Just go ahead. What?
 Good. Go.
 If Charlie and I were gonna get married who would be the man and who would be the woman in that situation? Neither of you would be the woman. You're both men! Are you kidding me? Is this what you've been upset about the whole time? Which one of us is gonna be the woman? Yeah. I'm not gonna get my dick cut off and sold to China spend the rest of my life on a treadmill like this guy. What are you- What? I don't want to be the woman, Charlie, and I don't want to see you be the woman. That's insa
 Neither of us would be the woman, dude. We would both be men. We'd be two cool straight dudes married together. Oh. I never thought of it that way. Two dudes getting married
 that doesn't seem very gay. Yeah, right? It's not
 Yeah, right. Yeah. Okay. You know what?
 Let's not argue on this or think about it too much.
 No.
 Two cool married dudes.
 Dudes. Two dudes.
 Not gay.
 I'm down with that.
 All right! Two gay dudes married!
 Bump it, bump it, bump it.
 Two gay dudes married.
 Is my role in this done now? Uh, any more questions? No. I think I got it. Hey, did they really sell your dick to China? No. I can tell by your stare that the answer is no. I told you, Frank. That's crazy. Dee, hey, we gotta talk. Wait. You can't just come barging in here like that. What are you doing? Okay, look, it takes a big man to admit defeat but you were right, I was wrong. Everybody should be able to get married to whoever they want which got me thinking about you and me. Oh, no. I'm not gonna marry you, if that's where this is headed. What? Dee, I would rather get shot in the face.
 Okay. Then what are you doing here?
 I'm glad you asked. I'm moving in. Also, I need to get on your gym membership because I got to get back in there ASAP before I lose this pump.
 What's with the beers? Are you carbo loading?
 No. Oh. What are you doing? Are you gonna throw up?
 No.
 Then why are you gagging? Oh, that
 Because, Dee, that triggers my gag reflex, too, and then I feel like I'm gonna throw up. It's fine. I had some bad spaghetti
 spaghetti
 Ah, Dee. Look, the point is
 the reason I came over here is because you were totally right about this marriage thing, okay? It is a special bond between two people in love and everybody deserves that right. Look, I'm thinking that- I gotta throw up.
 I'm gonna throw up.
 No, no, no, no! Not in there! Oh, sorry. Uh
 Wait. I know you. Bill Ponderosa. Where are you going? Hey, Maureen Ponderosa. Hey. I was just gonna go meet up with the guys. But I thought we were gonna watch a movie tonight. Watch a movie. Yes, we were. Yeah, you know what? But I feel the need to reconnect with the guys. So- But you know what?
 You can watch a movie without me.
 What? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. God, dude, we have so many great, great movies here. Got a lot of action films, which is very, very exciting. Got all the Lethal Weapon movies, which is cool. Including the one that I made with the guys- Lethal Weapon 5. Yes. Amazing film- truly, truly. Although it gets a little confusing halfway through because Mac and I decided to switch parts. He wanted to play Murtaugh for some reason. Yeah. And I'm not gonna lie. His use of black face I found a bit regrettable, but
 Come on. It's our first night as a married couple. I want to spend it with my husband. Oh. Yeah. I see that you're wearing another one of those kitty cat sweatshirts

 Meow.
 That you seem so fond of.
 You've glued some jewels and some flowers and things to it.
 Uh-huh.
 Interesting. I like to be comfy and current. Yeah. Yeah. I did not remember that about you.
 You don't remember a lot of things, silly.
 Yeah. Now, you get yourself on that couch.
 I'm gonna go make us fish sticks.
 Uh, I don't

 I don't think we have any fish sticks.
 I bought some. Yeah. I don't particularly like fish sticks, but

 Dennis.
 Hmm? Hey. I love you. Uh, I love you. Yeah.                     Hey! Hi. Hey. Come back to bed and snuggle with me. Oh. I wish I could, but I got to go to work. But there's cab fare on the nightstand. That's the third morning in a row you've done that. We're married. I'm already home, silly. Right. Y-You're here. We're married, and that's cool. I'm psyched, dude. That's great. So you're- Yeah. Okay. Well, you could use the cab fare to get to work.
 Oh, I don't work.
 Oh. Okay. I just thought maybe you weren't going to work recently because we were going through a little bit of a honeymoon phase.
 But you're saying that you don't have a job.
 No job.
 No job at all.
 Mmm.
 Wow.
 All yours.
 All mine. All mine all the time.
 All the time. Okay. Except on my work days. I do have to go to work. So, that's cool though. You can just hang out here, I guess and sort of get used to the lay of the land or whatever. Although don't go snooping around too much. 'Cause this has all happened very fast and I haven't really had time to do a pass yet. Don't- Don't look in those drawers. What- What's in those drawers? My sex tapes. Yeah.
 All right, I got to go to work.
 I love you. I love you too, Maureen. Uhh! Okay. Look, dude. All I'm saying is that you started off our domestic partnership on some very shaky, uh
 very bullshitty ground, dude. And I'm saying, Charlie, you should get over it, move on. You signed the prenup. Case closed. You told me it was the phone bill, man. Of course I signed it. Why would you think that you needed to sign a phone bill? Uh- I can't keep track of our financial comings and goings. When he hands me something to sign and it's about money and papers, I sign it. Hey-o! Look who got a brand-new car. I'm still a little bit confused as to why in the hell you two got married in the first place. Yeah, Charlie gets health insurance, and I get diddly squat. He's gonna get some perks. He doesn't trust me. Why in the hell are you bathing yourself in the sink? Because I don't have a home anymore.
 This is where I take a shower. This is where I live, Dennis. Texting me again. This is pathetic. Back me up on this, Dennis. You got a prenup with Maureen, right? Uh, no, I did not. Should I have? Should you have? You are screwed! Typical. This is so typical. My God! Dee, you clearly have something you want to say. So let's just get it over with. Oh, no. No, it's no big deal. It's just Bill Ponderosa. He's, like, obsessed with me now or something. He's texting me all the time. He calls me, like, nonstop. He bought me a new car. Dee, are you seriously bragging about sleeping with a married man? Yeah, one second you're on your high horse about how great marriage is and now you're destroying one?
 I'm not the one who's married. I didn't do anything wrong.
 You let him buy you a car. Well, Frank, I'm not gonna go passing on free cars. Guys. Guys, guys, guys, guys. All this talk about marriage and Dee being such a whore has got me thinking. I never got a bachelor party. We should go to the strip club.
 Right now?
 Yeah! Immediately! And since you would have been my best man, you should probably throw it for me. Yeah. What? No way, dude. I'm so pissed at you for throwing me out of the apartment. Yeah, and I'm still pretty pissed about you not throwing me a bachelor party. So this way I figure we'll be even. I'm ready for this. Being married to Charlie's got me all confused. I gotta get my hetero on. # Wanna get dirty Dirty # # I'm gonna make your body hot, girl # # Make you sweat # # I'm gonna give you the time of your life, yeah # I like that move. What is that, a little motorcycle? That's pretty- Yeah, not like that though. It's pretty good. But you gotta use a little bit more shoulder. I like the way he's doing it. 'Cause I'm like- I'm-I'm bending the bike. But that's not really how you drive a motorcycle.
 Yeah, but you're not really driving a motorcycle.
 It's my thing, okay?
 All right.
 If you're not gonna take it seriously
 Then don't do it.
 I felt like I was doing it pretty good. I feel like you're taking it too seriously.
 Let's not fight. It's a bachelor party.
 Oh! I got a text. I got a text from the woman. "Miss you." I'll just write back "Miss you too." Now do I write the word "too," or should I write the number "2"?
 What's the best way to do that when we're texting?
 Who cares, dude? I'll do the word. Okay, great! Frank, what's with the purse? This is my money bag. I'm gonna make it rain, baby. Whoa! Hold on. Make it rain? What is that? You're gonna chuck money everywhere? Don't do that.
 Will you lighten up?
 I'd like to make it rain. Can I make it rain, Mac? Why are you asking me? Dude, 'cause I can't fund my own bachelor party. That's just tacky. Fine. Excuse me. Hi. What is the recommended amount of money for one to make it rain? I'd say at least a thousand. How much would it cost for this gentleman and I to get a nice couple's dance? Uh, sorry. You have to be a couple for that. We are a couple. Charlie, documents.
 All right, this is what it was all for.
 Mm-hmm.
 Look at this. We're married.
 Yeah. Oh, you guys are cute. You're still gonna have to pay full price.
 Screw this. I'm gonna go make it rain.
 All right. Hang on a second. Give me some money. Let's go. I'm your husband. Give me some money.
 Here it is.
 What is this? I'm tightening the purse strings on this relationship until there's a little bit of give-and-take. You know what? Keep your money. I don't need your little allowance. We'll see. Oh, "miss you more." That's classic Maureen right there. She's always got to one-up me for some
 some reason. And so I'll write back what? I don't care. "Miss you most. " Most. Can't get more than most, right? So that should
 that should be the end of it, right? So I hope so. Oh, man. You just cannot get enough, huh? Sorry for just showing up, but you weren't responding to my texts. No, I totally get it. Once you pop, you can't stop, am I right? Actually, I came clean to my wife, and she kicked me out of the house.
 Ooh. Ouch.
 Yeah. Bet you wish you could take that one back, huh? So I was thinking maybe I could stay here tonight.
 Oh.
 Well, you are somewhat responsible for this. No. No, no, no, no. Can't you stay in a hotel or something? I would, but she froze my assets. Yikes. Shit's getting pretty real for you, huh? But nonetheless, uh, I really, like I said, I don't want you in my space. So there's got to be a lot of other places that you could stay that aren't, you know, here. Dee, I gave you a car.
 Oh, you're gonna jam the car in my face, huh?
 Mmm. Come in. Thanks.
 # The boys are back in town #

 Whoo!
 Dennis! Hey! What are you doing? It is 2:00 in the morning. I was sleeping, Dennis. That's cool. Well, you're up now, baby girl. So let's do some shots! No. I don't drink. You know that. I think it makes people look ugly.
 I

 Maybe I should go to my room. That is not your room anymore. It is my craft studio. So kindly stay out of there.
 Don't freak, dude. It's-It's all good, dude.
 What? She turned it into her craft studio where she makes terrible sweatshirts out of cats, or puts cats in sweatshirts and then I'm, like, dude, what the hell did you do? What? Dennis, do not talk to me that way. I am your wife. Please show me some respect in front of your friends. Uh, you know what? I'm not entirely certain that you are my wife. 'Cause I remember marrying Maureen Ponderosa. And you are no Maureen Ponderosa. That doesn't even
 I don't know what that- What?
 Divorce!
 What? What did you just say? I will divorce you, Maureen. I'll do it. Okay, you're drunk. Why don't we just go to bed
 I'm not drunk. I'm more sober than I've ever been in my entire life. Okay, I'm a little bit drunk
 I'm totally drunk, but my mind is sober. And my mind's telling me the following: I don't love you, Maureen. I don't love you. I never loved you. You're annoying, and you're strange. I don't know what to say. Don't say anything. 'Cause every time you open your mouth, I'm, like, ohh! It's like her breath is, like, always so bad. It's like a dead tooth
 It's the dead tooth. I'm saying it now. I'll say it. You have a dead tooth. You realize that, right? And I hate it! And it's annoying! I want you and your boy toy out of my apartment now! I'm the boy toy. You're my boy toy. No, I'm not gonna leave our apartment
 Or should I say my apartment
 'cause it's my apartment. Oh, yeah? How about if you guys don't leave I call the cops and I tell them you beat me? What in the hell are you talking about? I didn't touch you. What-What
 What are you doing? What is that?
 I recognize that. What is that?
 Oh, shit! That's from
 That's from Fear, dude.
 Oh, that's Marky Mark.
 That's Marky Mark. That's what Marky Mark does. He does that. And then, um
 Oh, shit, and then the cops come and he gets

 The police think that William Peterson

 And he gets it.
 The guy from C.S.I.

 Go! She means business.
 She means business.
 Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, my God.
 You are really making yourself at home here, huh?
 Yeah.
 Sorry. You want to have sex?
 What? No. No. God, no. Please close your legs up. That's
 Listen, I-I don't want to get into your personal life, you know what I mean? It's not really any of my business. But this is really bumming me out, okay? So here's what I'd like to do. I'd like to talk game plan with you, okay? And number one, and most importantly, uh, the car. Now hear me out. It was kind of a gift. So it'd be pretty rude of you to try and

 I don't give a shit about the car, okay? My life is in ruins.
 Mm-hmm.
 I'm gonna lose my kids.
 Okay, great. So we're in agreement. I keep the car. That's wonderful. Now secondly
 and this is gonna be kind of hard to hear
 but, um, get out! Get out! You gotta go back to your wife, okay, and get out of my place! Okay, well, I'm gonna need the car to get over there. Well, the car's off the table, okay? We just discussed the car and we came to an agreement that
 Stop bringing up the car, okay? So I'll get dressed and I'll drive you over there and I'll drop you off.
 Okay.
 Okay. Well, get up. Oh, God. I don't- I don't
 Okay, I'm gonna go in here. Jesus. You know, I wouldn't have imagined the whole thing going down the way it did. It was a little uncomfortable. I'm glad we got our little "heart-to-heart"
 or whatever you want to call it
 out of the way. I feel like now we can set aside our differences and settle this whole divorce pretty amicably.
 You think it's gonna be that easy, dude?
 Well, yeah, of course. I mean, marriage and divorce these days is like more of a formality than anything else. It's just sort of something that you do, right? Don't snap at me, Charlie! You bring nothing to the table!
 Oh! Oh!
 Nothing! This is my money!
 I bring nothing to the table!
 You bring nothing to the table! Oh, really? Do you ever stop for one second and think about "Hey, hey, where do all of the groceries come from
 Frank, okay?"
 Ohh! "Oh, how did my laundry get so clean?" "Oh, oh, who washed all the dishes today?" Nobody washes the dishes! We eat the food directly off the coffee table and you know it! I cannot stand being married to you! You can't stand it? I'm gonna pull the plug.
 You're gonna flush our marriage down the toilet?
 Right down the toilet!
 Flush it, big boy!
 Yes! There we go!
 Flush it down the toilet 'cause I don't care!
 Oh, yeah? I'm gonna pull the plug, but first I'm gonna draw up some documents. This is gonna be an ugly-ass divorce. We're gonna get a mediator. Okay, I got it. We'll get that idiot lawyer that helps us out. He does good by us. Yeah, he's excellent. But he slapped a restraining order on us. We can't use him.
 Also, you need a lawyer too. We should talk about that.
 I need a lawyer? For what? How are you not grasping this situation?
 Oh, for the divorce. Yeah.
 The divorce.
 You getting a divorce?
 Yeah. All right, so it's going around. Okay, I think I know someone who will take both our cases. Ah. Is it you? Is it? 'Cause if it's you, I'm not interested. Well, I have a family member who's a lawyer. I bet he'd do it. It's coming up here. This- Yeah, this is it right here. Ponderosa's Ponderosa. Could you wait a minute? I just want to make sure it's okay. Yeah, you know, whatever it's gonna take to wrap this up, really. Maureen? No, it's Dee. How are things going on your end? Oh, not bad. Yeah, not bad. I'm getting a divorce. Well, I know how that goes. Got a messy situation going on on my end too. Had to let my guy go. Had to cut him loose. I tell you what though. I do love the car. Hands-free, Blue

 I can do all kinds of stuff with both hands. Dennis? Did we get cut off?
 Okay, hop in there.
 Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! What is this? What are you doing? Here he goes. Okay, go, go.
 What?
 Go! Go! Oh, my God! I'm so glad you called, Charlie. Your uncle never hears from you anymore. Well, you're kinda the only actual lawyer I know who doesn't have a restraining order against me
 So I sort of had to call you

 Hey, hey, I-I miss you too, bud. Mmm, with the touching. With the touching. None of that. You're put off by my hands. I know they're very small. It's been very hard on me. There's nothing wrong with your hands, okay? Can we just focus on the law? Of course. All right. As far as shared assets, I'm not seeing much.
 I'm keeping the hot plate!
 Over my dead body! Hey, hey, hey! Easy, boys. Don't let the dog off the leash, okay? Remember, the bigger man walks away first. He can have the hot plate. Oh! Hot dog! Now we're cooking with gas! Moving along to art holdings. All I'm seeing is a series of drawings of elephants.
 Mmm.
 Oh. Oh, yeah. Well, Charlie did the elephant drawings.
 Yeah, but

 You should keep 'em.
 I did those for you, man.
 I like 'em. Well, you should like 'em. I put a lot of work into 'em. And thank you for saying you like 'em.
 I've seen 'em, and I like 'em too.
 Yeah, they're good. I'll keep the drawings, okay? If I didn't know any better I'd say there's a lot of love in this room. Look, Jack, we just want to get back to where we were. Sounds like what you guys want is an annulment. It would essentially void your partnership.
 Yeah. Right. That sounds perfect.
 Marriage blows. Preaching to the choir, fellas. All right. I just need both your signatures on here. All right, that's easy enough. Easy-peasy. One. Two! We did it! That's it. Your union has hereby been dissolved. Why did we have to do all the touching and the hand holding if it was just
 It was fun. Hey, Mac. You mind snapping a photo for the Web site? But keep my hands out of the shot. I'll put 'em down here. You guys. You guys, I need help. I don't know what to do. I just kidnapped Bill Ponderosa's kids. All right. Are the kids confined in any way?
 Maybe in a crawl space or a backyard bunker?
 No. They're out in the car.
 Have you touched them yet?
 Absolutely not. What- Who is this man? Don't- You're- You don't need to

 What is she, some cheap tramp?
 Oh, no! Oh, my God! You are such an asshole! I followed you, okay?
 I knew you were seeing someone else!
 Honey, no
 Hi. Hi, there. I'm Dee. Uh, I understand that. Listen, I want to just say I'm really sorry about- about the kids. I tell you what, I did not mean to kidnap them. That was all- That was all this guy. They're not my kids.
 Aren't you his wife?
 No. I'm his mistress. Well, what the hell, man?
 I'm taking my car back.
 Nuh-uh. That's my car.
 Actually, I loaned it to both of you ladies. You son of a bitch! I'm gonna kill you! What? How many mistresses do you have? Mistress? I'm his wife! Kids, let's go.
 Yeah, come on, kids. Let's go home.
 No, no, no, no, no. Not you, Bill. Now I want this to be over with right now!
 So how much does he owe you?
 What? How much does he owe you, whore? How much does he owe you for the sex? Oh. No, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. I'm not a prostitute. I think that's- that's clear.
 You know?
 Oh. Well, congratulations. You're the only woman he didn't have to pay to sleep with. You must be very proud of yourself. Wait! No, no! Oh, goddamn it! Yeah. Well, the, uh, gravity of my situation just set in.
 So

 Let's go get you a divorce, huh?
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Definitely.
 Yep. You guys, uh, have any questions? Yeah, I got a question. What's in the fanny pack? Oh, check this out, Mac and Dennis. Just a little victory dance. Thought maybe we could hang out later. No- Um
 Oh, Mr. Reynolds. Oh, uh, I'm sorry. What are you doing here? Well, when I heard you were getting divorced I-I felt compelled to involve myself. I'm sorry. How would you have heard that I was getting a divorce? I-I-I may have told him. I so enjoyed listening to you drunkenly explain all that at 3:00 a.m. I enjoyed it so much that I tracked down Maureen here and I offered her my services, pro bono, of course. Hold on, fellas. I'm Jack Kelly. I'm a lawyer. Hello, Jack Kelly. The pleasure is all mine.
 It's a pleasure to meet you.
 The pleasure's still

 Why don't we just get started?
 Why don't we just get started? Ahh.
 Boy, the old place, huh?
 Uhh

 Yeah.
 Some good memories here. All of us. Hey, um

 So I was like

 I'm gonna go. No, no, no. No, stick around, dude. Stick- Stick around.
 Please don't

 I don't want to though.
 No, you should stay.
 Yeah.
 Shea butter.
 Oh.
 Assorted lanolin products.
 Oh, God. I'm serious. You could be a hand model. You've got the goods. Well, that was quick, guys. Open-and-shut case, Dennis.
 Okay.
 Did you get the apartment back? I sure did. You did? You did? And you also acquired Miss Ponderosa's debt. What? You're in debt? Not anymore. But you are. About 90K. This guy seems to think you don't have a case and I'm inclined to agree with him. Yeah. When I found out that Miss Ponderosa here had been cast out of her marital home I-I only thought it was fair that you assumed her debt in addition to the alimony payments, of course. Wait a second. So I gotta pay alimony payments? Uncle Jack, what the hell? I-I froze up. He's great. Oh, congratulations, Ms. Ponderosa. Oh, congratulations to you. See you around, Dennis.
 Yeah.
 Mac. Hey, Mac, would you mind taking a shot of the three of us for the Web site? Come on, Dennis. And would it be okay if you put your hands on top of mine
 Like they're my hands?
 Like that?
 Yes.
 Okay.
 That looks like my hands.
 Yeah. For the Web site. We're lawyers.                     Thank you so much for taking the time to meet with us.
 Yes. This shouldn't take long.
 Uh-uh.
 So, you'd like to buy a boat.
 Yes. We have recently come into a considerable amount of money. We're not gonna bore you with the details but let's just say my friends here set off on a certain towel venture

 Dicktowel. com.
 Yeah.
 You're not supposed to talk about the name of it.
 That's true. Technically, we're doing a couple of things on the hush-hush from Uncle Sam. The point is, we're flush. We are $2,500 flush, so don't worry about that. We'd like to take some of that money
 And taste a little bit of the high life.
 Absolutely. We've also talked our friend into throwing his entire life savings into the venture. That's right. I'm in it for the lifestyle as well as the great investment. Okay. Well, then what is it you guys are looking for? Let's talk needs, please. I'd like to talk needs first. Now, I have the need for speed. It's very important. It's inherent. There's nothing I can do about it, so speed is a must. Absolutely. But we are also looking to entertain guests upon this boat, so
 Yeah. We're gonna throw some P. Diddy-style parties up on the deck. Um, can we talk shrimp for a minute? I'd like the boat to be able to haul in a tremendous amount of shrimp
 Sort of a Forrest Gump size amount of shrimp. Um, you should be writing this down, I think. Why are you not writing this down? Let me just see if I have this right here
 and, please, correct me if I'm wrong. It seems like what you guys are looking for is some sort of a P. Diddy-style shrimping vessel. Oh, right! You're a really good listener and I didn't peg you for one 'cause of the pinky ring, but that's great. You know, I've got just the boat for you. Well, here she is- the Drowning Sailor. But, uh, it doesn't meet, well, any of your specs. I'm gonna level with you, pal. We saw this comin' a mile away. We've had our hearts set on this boat thing for days now which, in our world, is a level of focus in which I personally have never experienced.
 But I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say

 We'll take it! Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Wh-What are you doing? I was doing a thing.
 Takin' a long time, dude.
 We wanted to buy a boat. Let's get the boat. It was taking a little while because I was doing a presentation
 What if someone walks down the deck and makes an offer before us? Nobody's gonna make an offer before I finish my thing. We're not the only people that want a boat. I'm confused. Are you gonna take the boat or not? Yes, we're buying the boat. I wanted to add a little fanfare into the situation but my friends here couldn't wait for that. Yes, we're-we're taking the boat. What a score!
 Houseboat, huh?
 Yeah. Abso
 The houseboat offers all the advantages of a house but with the excitement of the sea.
 Think of all the fish we're gonna catch.
 Not just fish, Frank. You gotta start thinking about shrimp, okay? We're gonna be hauling in so much shrimp every day it's gonna pay for itself 10 times over. Picture tiny shrimp crawling all over this boat, every inch of it. Guys, can we not focus on the shrimp? 'Cause we have so much work to do. It's a shrimp boat. I'd like to have at least one conversation about shrimp. No, shrimp is a very small aspect of the whole
 Most important part of the
 Tell you what. Shrimp or no shrimp, I'm very excited about it and I say we take this lady out onto the sea and get loaded. Slow your roll there, Dee. The lady's not quite ready to go out to the sea yet. There's a lot of prep work that still has to be done. Actually, Frank and Charlie, I want you to start by scraping the barnacles off the bottom of the boat
 'cause that probably hasn't been done in years
 while Dee and Mac and I go into the inside and check out the decor situation.
 Huh?
 Mmm.
 One word.
 Shrimp. Okay. Yeah. No. Just as I suspected. We got our work cut out for us, guys. This isn't Diddy-esque at all. No. We gotta get rid of all this shit. Are you guys crazy? This boat is awesome. How about a little of this? Huh? What the hell is that? This? That's my P. Diddy boat dance. Uh-huh! You look like one of those inflatable dancing things at the used-car lot

 The ones that flail around in the wind.
 No, I don't. I look good. No, Dee. That's exactly what you look like. I promise you that's what you look like. You can't dance for shit. I can dance, and you don't know what you're talking about. I'm gonna bring one in so you can see it. Okay. Why don't you bring the guy in. We'll have a dance competition. I'm gonna be the judge of that contest. There's not gonna be a contest. No, stop. Everybody stop. Shut up! No, nobody's bringing any trashy inflatable man on this boat. Absolutely not. Dee, stop dancing. You look like an asshole. We're not there yet. We have a lot of work to do first. Okay, Dee, since you didn't invest any money in this venture you're gonna be the one that's got to do all the hard labor here so I need you to get rid of all this shit, and make the boat look nice, okay? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hard work? What are you talking about? Work first, and then you can do your weird, inflatable tube-man P. Diddy dance. Or whatever it is. You know what I'm looking forward to
 Is catching me some Delaware River catfish.
 Oh, yeah! They are so tasty! I used to eat 'em when I was a kid. You can't buy 'em in the stores no more.
 Why is that?
 The goddamned E.P.A. They says they're toxic. Toxic my ass. I mean, they're just endangered.
 Frank

 They're tasty, man. This boat is the best investment I ever made, man. I mean, it's huge! We're gonna pop over to the boat store real quick and grab some, uh- Whoa! What the hell are you guys doing?
 We're loading our gear.
 No, no, no, no. You should not be loading. No one should be bringing anything onto the boat. You should be scraping, okay? So scrape. Oh, well, we're gonna scrape the boat. We are gonna scrape the boat. Are you patronizing me? Don't patronize me. Don't do that. No one's patronizing you, all right? Here's what we'll do. We'll scrape all these little delicious oysters or whatever off the side of the boat. We'll boil 'em up before you get back.
 We'll cook 'em for you.
 There you go. No, those are barnacles. Do not eat those. Do not serve them to us.
 Okay, all that.
 Honestly, don't eat those.
 You'll get very, very sick, okay?
 Yeah. Now that is a direct order from your captain. Whoa! Since when are you the captain? Clearly I'm the captain. Who else would be the captain? I feel like I would be the captain. Dennis?
 I don't give a shit.
 I'm captain! I called it! Locked in. Boom. Scrape. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
 I ain't scraping shit.
 No, we're not scraping!
 No, no scraping.
 Here's what we're gonna do.
 We're gonna fire up the boat, right?
 Yeah. We're gonna take it out into the ocean. We're gonna get some oysters.
 And shrimp.
 And shrimpies!
 Toss me the keys.
 Here you go. What the hell was that? It's the keys. I threw 'em right at ya. I asked you to toss 'em! You threw 'em overhand!
 That's the way I throw.
 Jump in there and get 'em.
 I'm not going in there. I don't sink.
 What? I get in there, I just bob around like a cauliflower. Don't give me lines. Jump in the ocean and get the damn keys. No, I'm not going in. Charlie, I'm not going in. It's your boat. You go on in. You son of a bitch. All right. Yo.
 Hey, buddy. Uh, I got us some turpentine, some wax and some high-gloss boat paint.
 This shit is really expensive.
 You're telling me. I picked us up some new slacks and Docksiders so we could have the right look and fit in and everything. We're running pretty low on remaining dick towel money though.
 We got to fill that thing up with gas.
 I know, man. We got to pop by the department store, pick up the mattress. I want to get a nice one too. You know? The what? The mattress? What do we need a mattress for? What do you mean what do we need a mattress for? Why do you think we just spent all that money on a boat? The whole purpose of buying the boat was to get the ladies nice and tipsy topside so we can take them to a nice comfortable place below deck and, you know, they can't refuse
 because of the implication. Oh. Uh, okay. You had me going there for the first part. The second half kind of threw me. Well, dude, think about it. She's out in the middle of nowhere with some dude she barely knows. She looks around, and what does she see? Nothing but open ocean. "Ah, there's nowhere for me to run. What am I going to do, say no?" Okay. That

 That seems really dark.
 No, it's not dark. You're misunderstanding me, bro.
 I think I am.
 Yeah, you are.
 Because if the girl said no, then the answer obviously is no.
 No. The thing is, she's not gonna say no. She would never say no, because of the implication. Now, you've said that word "implication" a couple of times. Wh-What implication? The implication that things might go wrong for her if she refuses to sleep with me. Now, not that things are gonna go wrong for her but she's thinking that they will. But it sounds like she doesn't want to have sex with you.
 Why aren't you understanding this?
 I don't
 She doesn't know whether she wants to have sex with me. That's not the issue.
 Are you gonna hurt women?
 I'm not going to hurt these women.
 Why would I ever hurt these women?
 I don't know.
 I feel like you're not getting this.
 I'm not getting it. Goddamn. Don't you look at me like that. You certainly wouldn't be in any danger.
 So they are in danger?
 No one's in any danger. How can I make that any more clear to you? Okay, it's an implication of danger.
 You know what? Just drop it.
 Let's drop it. Buy your shit and let's get out of here. Oh, Charlie. Charlie, you got 'em?
 No keys. Can't find 'em.
 What? I found a couple cool things.
 What?
 I got a tooth.
 Ooh, look at that.
 It's like a horse's tooth or something.
 Ah, yeah. And look at this bullet. Ooh! This is a war relic. This could be valuable. What the hell happened down there? Some kind of horse massacre?
 Could be.
 Could be, right?
 Yeah.
 There's so much cool shit down there I'm gonna keep diving, looking for it. I need a flashlight 'cause it's dark. Flashlight coming up. Just toss it to me real quick.
 Come on, man.
 I throw overhand, Charlie. Ooh. # Stop # # Drop # # Shut 'em down Open up shop #
 # Oh #
 What the hell are you doing in here? Aw, just throwing all these old, like dolls and compasses and hair brushes and shit overboard. Mac and Dennis are making me clean up.
 Well, this is a shit-hole, isn't it?
 Yeah.
 Maybe we should gut it.
 All right. Let's see. Ooh. Ah! Here we go. Now let's see. Start with this beautiful baby here. Whoa! Crash and burn. Holy mackerel. Die, you sucker! Oh, baby, look out. Whoa! That ain't good. Whoa, Christ! Think about, like, all the movies and the books and all the stories of all the terrible, awful, awful things that have happened out in the middle of the ocean. You know, that's the stuff that's rattling around in her head informing her decision as to whether she sleeps with me or not. That's all I'm saying. It's not like a big thing or
 Uh-huh. Look, I need you to understand this, okay?
 You're making it seem like I'm some sort of monster.
 Yeah, okay. Hey, wha
 What is going on in there?
 Like this?
 It's more like a rolling sway. What the hell are you guys doing in here? Oh, my God. What the hell did you do to our boat?
 Uh, we were cleaning it.
 Wow, wow, wow. What's that all about? You're just breaking everything in this boat. You were supposed to be fixing it up and making it look nice. Crew meeting! Crew meeting!
 Where is Charlie?
 He's in the water. What is he doing in the water? Charlie.
 What are you doing?
 Oh, hey, guys, come here. You are not going to believe how much cool shit is under the boat. There's like a whole world of ancient stuff. There was a horse massacre in the Revolutionary time and then there's like a pirate ship. Like, I found all these old pretty little dolls. She's pretty, right?
 No.
 Maybe like a brush

 Like a pirate was brushing his hair

 No! killed a horse and then jumped in the ocean. Goddamn it! I've been cleaning up in there for hours throwing this shit overboard, and you're just dragging it all back up. You've been dumping the trash in the ocean? Wait, wait. Why are you swimming in the water in the first place?
 He dropped the keys in the water.
 I did not. All right, first of all, he threw the keys at me overhand. You should have seen this throw. We leave you guys alone for 45 minutes and you destroy the interior of the boat, you lose the keys
 I can get those keys. I need you guys to buy some scuba equipment so I can stay down there longer. Do you realize how much money scuba equipment costs? No. Rent the cheap stuff. Just rent some cheap stuff, all right? In the meantime, we'll clear all this stuff off. We'll start to paint, all right? By the time you guys come back, I promise you, I promise, the boat will be looking better. I can't tell. Is he patronizing me again? I can't even tell anymore. No. What he's saying is really stupid, but it's sincere, okay? It's sincere this time. You're just a little sensitive to it now.
 Sorry, Charlie.
 I'm sorry too. That was patronizing! You can't patronize your captain.
 Come on. Come on.
 That's a sea law. Yo, dude. You realize how much boating equipment costs? It's crazy. It's astronomical. I can't believe how much they charge for this shit. You know, Dee, Frank and Charlie are driving me crazy. We're spending all of our dick towel money. They're throwing keys into the water and losing everything. You're not even listening to me. No, I heard you. You said a bunch of words. Look at this.
 What is that?
 It's like some kind of dock party mixer, dude. It's a flyer. Look at these chicks. And an anchor. Dude, that's what we need to be doing. We need to mix it up at mixers with other boat people and living the lifestyle. You're right. Okay, cool.
 And then we'll be back in the high life again.
 Yeah.
 Like Stevie Nicks.
 That's actually Steve Winwood.
 Right. Same dude, right?
 It's not the same dude. Actually, one's not even a dude.
 Are you sure?
 Yeah, I'm sure. It doesn't matter, dude. I love that song. Let's buy that CD. Well, first of all, I love that song too. That's why I already own the CD. I own all of Steve Winwood's shit. You should know this. Secondly, we have not been on the same page all day. We can't be spending money on CDs that I already own. We're spending too much money as it is. It's bad enough I let you buy that stupid inflatable guy from the car lot. # Wanna get dirty # Stop it! Stop it! Goddamn it, don't! It's not the puffy guy. It's this music

 This aggressive music you're playing.
 Huh? This is not boat music. It's got nothing to do with the music. Listen to me. Listen to me! I'm turning it off. Riled you up.
 Yo, you guys.
 Look at you- Fighting with a green guy. You're never going to believe what I just found floating off the end of the boat. Okay, I'm scraping those little delicious oysters off the bottom, right?
 Why is this turned off?
 You're back. You don't even
 I got to say, guys, I'm very impressed. The boat's really starting to come along. I didn't think you guys had it in you. There's a couple more brushes here and a little paint. Get to work. We'll do the trim and then we'll be done. Us? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. We're not going to be doing any of that. You're not gonna be doing any of that? What do you mean? We're not gonna be doing any of the work. That's what you guys are doing. That was the whole deal.
 No, we got a party to get ready for.
 Yeah. We're going to do all the work while you guys go to a party?
 We got to socialize.
 I could socialize. Uh, no. Not looking like you're looking. You're covered in paint and dirt and grime and all kinds of shit. Your skin looks like leather and you got blisters all over your lips. You guys look absolutely terrible. Well, we're out of here. So, Charlie there's your, uh- here's your scuba gear. Find the keys. Just find 'em. Oh, guys- Keep up the good work. See, now they flipped it around. They're patronizing us. They're absolutely patronizing us, Frank. But don't take it to heart, 'cause I got something that's going to cheer you up.
 What?
 Guess who found the keys.
 The keys!
 You found the keys! They were just floating under the boat. They got a little floaty thing. This is amazing, by the way
 these floaty things. We should patent this. Okay, I think this is it. Now this is much more our speed. These are the kind of people we should be hanging out with. Man, now this is a boat. Ahoy, ahoy. Hi. Hi. A couple of fellow yachters. Saw your flyer at the boat store. Oh. Do-Do we have the wrong yacht? No, no, no. Come on in. Grab a drink. We're just getting warmed up.
 Okay.
 Sure. We'll just
 Yeah.
 Uh, can I talk to you for a second?
 Yeah. Um, this isn't the crowd I was expecting. These guys are more barnacle covered and sunburned than Dee and Frank. Let's not rush to judgment, okay? These are real men of the sea. Maybe this whole thing isn't about meeting girls. Maybe it's about having an adventure, you know? An open-ocean adventure. Take a look at this guy. How'd he lose that hand? I bet you it was some kind of crazy adventure, right? Let's find out.
 Yeah.
 Let's go talk to him. Hey, bro, how'd you lose that hand? Diabetes. Oh. Um
 That's not, uh, much of an adventure, is it?
 Mmm.
 Kind of tragic.
 Yeah.
 Yeah. You know, we'll let you get back to
 We're gonna go over to the bar and grab a drink. I'd offer to pour you a drink, but you probably can't drink though with the, uh

 Diabetes.
 Diabetes.
 Uh, yeah.
 Yeah. Okay, you know what? I was wrong, dude.
 This is a bummer.
 Yeah, this is a major bummer. Let's get the hell out of here. What do you say? Hey, guys, thanks for everything. I think we're just gonna take off though. No, no, no, no. Don't do that. We're just getting warmed up. We're going to set sail soon and we're going to have a couple of tasty treats out there. It's going to get nuts out there, fellas, right? We're going to be out on open ocean, right? Huh? Anything can happen out there. No laws. Right, boys? Just us and our tasty treats.
 That was an implication, right?
 That was definitely the implication. Tasty treats? Are we the tasty treats? We're the tasty treats in this scenario. They're gonna take us out into the open ocean. They're gonna have their way with us. We gotta get out of here.
 Is this how you wanted those women to feel?
 No. You know what? I don't enjoy having this conversation with you. I feel like you're lumping me in with them. Now, gentlemen, the moment you've all been waiting for.
 Whoo! Yeah.
 The ladies have arrived. # I'll be back in the high life again # # All the doors I closed one time # # Will open up again # # I'll be back in the high life- # Oh, Frank, you were absolutely right. This is boat music. Yeah, this is the kind of music you ought to listen to. I am learning some amazing moves from this guy. Yeah, you're doing great. You got the moves. Does anybody want any more catfish? Yo, dude, definitely give me another one of those. They're delicious!
 And you can taste that sort of endangered tang.
 That's it. Oh, hold on. I'm getting a call. Y'ello.
 Hey, Charlie, did you guys ever find those keys?
 Yeah, man, I did, actually. I did. Can you believe that?
 Okay, great. I need you to grab Frank and Dee and get the hell out of there because we're gonna be bringing back a couple of tasty treats, if you know what I'm saying. Hey, man, yeah. Absolutely. I'll get right on that.
 What?
 That's how you patronize someone right there.
 What, what, what, what, what?
 Dennis being a dick. Don't worry about it, man.
 This scuba equipment's broken. It's useless.
 The hell with it. Let's get back to shrimping. I'm gonna toss this shit. It's crap anyway. Ooh, that's not good. Uh, hey, um, what do you do if the boat is on fire?
 What do you mean?
 Boat is on fire.
 Oh, fire's getting bigger.
 What?
 Fire's getting big. Fire's getting big.
 Go!
 Help!
 Holy shit!
 Find some water.
 Find some water? What do you mean find some water?
 There's water everywhere.
 Help! Help us. I cannot wait to get you ladies out into the sea. It's so much more romantic in the middle of nowhere where we can be completely alone and you can make rash decisions based on fear. Right, Dennis? Uh, yeah. Yeah. Oh
 Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I thought we told you guys to beat it. Out of my way. No more Diddy boat. Damn catfish nipping at my heels all the way
 Endangered, my ass.
 There's a billion of them out there.
 Ugh. What the hell happened? That was a hell of a swim. Charlie, where's the boat? What happened to the boat? It's right there. This was a terrible investment. Whew!                       Back with the Preston and Steve Show. Listen up. We've got to open up the phone lines. The first listener who can correctly answer our stupid trivia question of the day is gonna get to come down to the Flyers game with us tomorrow night and take a shot from center ice. If you make it, you win two V.I.P. passes to the 93. 3 WMMR Beach House for our Start of Summer Blowout! Who would want to spend a weekend at a beach house with these idiots?
 Nothing but busy signals.
 I'm on hold on all of 'em. We're gonna get through. You're on hold on those?
 Hey, who's on the line?
 Uh, uh, Mac from South Philly! All right, Mac from South Philly, you're on with Preston and Steve!
 Holy shit! He got on!
 Holy shit! I got on! Please don't curse. All right, here's the question. What Philadelphia Flyer holds the franchise record for goals in a season? You have 30 seconds. Go!
 It's a hockey question!
 Go, go! Hockey, hockey! Where's the "H" key? There's no "H" key!
 What are you talking about?
 Is there another way to spell "hockey"?
 There's no "H" key!
 There's an "H" right there! Why did I put you in charge of this job? Forget this. I got this. Think, Mac. Think. Think. Think.
 I gotta think like that guy that sits on the rock.
 This dude? The one like that?
 Yeah, with the big muscles. He puts his hand on his He's big, green and gets angry?
 The Thinker?
 The Thinker. Oh, the Hulk! The Incredible Hulk! Hulk doesn't think at all! Shit, I know this. Dude, you gotta stop cursing. You guys can't censor me. I'm a bit of a badass. All right, let's go! Answer the question! Come on! I don't know. I don't know it. Damn it! Reggie Leach. Reggie Leach is the correct answer! Wow! Center ice shot, baby! # We're goin' to the beach house # # Gonna make our dreams come true # # Down at the beach house is what we're gonna #
 # Do-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh #
 Yeah! This is a potentially life-changing opportunity. Not potentially. It is a life-changing opportunity. It is! Sorry. How is spending a weekend at a radio show beach house a life-changing opportunity? Dude, there is gonna be so many athletes and celebrities at that beach house. This is my chance to finally sow myself into the inner circle. I'm gonna be like a local sports legend.
 Hey, can we have our phones back?
 Oh, yeah, yeah. Why don't you get on 'em about using the minutes on the cell phones? They used up all your minutes. Right? Frank, nobody gives a shit about minutes anymore. Actually, you know what? I do give a shit about minutes. I know I shouldn't and I'm just probably buying into the phone company's propaganda.
 But there you go.
 Interesting.
 What is happening here? Why are you taping them?
 Because they got great banter. They jib-jab. Jib-jab, jib-jab, jib-jab. I use it for the car because my stereo's busted. We have a lot of interesting things to say, so
 Oh, shit, I feel like the conversation we've been having the last five minutes is a lot more interesting than the shit they're talking about on the radio. You kidding? Moronic commentary, stupid sound effects. It's dumb. It doesn't make any sense. We have voices. We talk about the issues. I feel like we could do a podcast and it would be a million times better
 Than whatever that drivel was we were listening to.
 Without a doubt.
 You know what? This sounds like jealousy talk.
 Yeah. "Mac, Charlie, congratulations on your slap shot and the beach house. Okay? Uh, we're happy for you."
 You're sad sometimes. You're dark souls.
 Why aren't you happy for us?
 You wanna just do our thing and let

 Let's do our thing. Have fun with your important conversations and your big issues with your brains and your smart stuff, okay?
 We got hockey to learn!
 And we're gonna

 And it's gonna change our lives.
 Life-changing!
 Okay. It was The Thinker. It's The Thinker.
 You couldn't spell hockey. Oh! Zing! Boom-boom! Hold on a second. You guys are the best. Do not speak until I turn my tape over. Okay. Oh, shit! I taped over my Luther Vandross mix! Ahh! Okay, dude, now we're both in agreement. This is probably the biggest opportunity either of us have ever had in our lives, right? We are not men who get a lot of opportunities, Charlie.
 The few we've had, we've squandered.
 We've squandered 'em all. That's why we gotta stay focused, Mac. I mean, this is pro sports!
 We gotta do this right. You gotta look good.
 Yeah. And you can't miss that shot, right?
 I really appreciate you helping me, dude.
 Absolutely.
 A little pee-wee hockey experience never hurts.
 You're good. Okay, so first things first.
 Hold the hockey stick.
 Hold the hockey stick.
 Mm-hmm.
 Okay, good. 'Cause I was thinking I'd have a position sort of like this. Why would you do that? All of my instincts and my training tell me to use this as a weapon. All of your instincts and your training are wrong. Hold it like a hockey stick or people are going to boo you.
 The Philly fans are brutal, dude.
 All right, fine! All right? Right. Then you just sort of haunch down a little bit.
 Okay? Can you

 Done. You might wanna hau
 You look stiff like a
 You look like a G. I. Joe action figure. Loosen up. And haunch.
 What if I do this?
 That's way stiffer!
 That's pretty good right there, Charlie.
 You look so awkward. Bro, when you tack on mass you sacrifice flexibility. That's just a straight-up fact! That's insane! Touch your toes! What am I, a gymnast?
 Teach me how to shoot the shot!
 All right, fine, fine. Calm down. All right. What you're gonna want to do is just gently
 gently sort of guide the puck at the net like, you know, like a tiny bowl of cream you don't want to spill and you're guiding it. I'm not gonna do that. I'm gonna go out there and take a wicked slap shot. You know? Really make a name for myself. Otherwise I go out there, I look like a jabroni. You know what? Yeah. We might wanna work on some kind of routine, huh? Thank you. Exactly. So I'll go out there, I showcase my weaponry
 Uh-huh. Pump the crowd up.
 Really get the crowd up and raise the roof. Huh?
 Okay. But you can't take a slap shot before you even know how to handle a stick and a puck. So will you just glide one? Just to get the form. And then we'll get bigger and bigger and eventually slap shots. But it starts with gliding like cream. Go!
 Gliding like a jabroni is what I'm gonna be doing.
 Jabroni. Okay, go.
 Well, that didn't do anything.
 That was pretty pathetic. You're right. The problem is, I'm out in the elements, dude. There's so much wind and sun.
 And this asphalt- That's not regulation.
 No, it's not regulation

 So it's not gonna slide.
 All right, you know what? You wanna do this the right way?
 Yeah.
 Let's go to the ice. Let's get some pucks. All right? We'll slide, we'll take a few slap shots. We'll do this the right way.
 Let's go to the ice.
 Let's go to the ice. All right, very exciting stuff. We're pretty much ready to go with this podcast. What the hell is a podcast? Why don't you just tape it? What are you doing? You don't have to tape it these days, Frank. You just record it right onto the computer. And once we start recording, Frank, I'm gonna need you to stop eating those crackers. It's incredibly annoying, and it's all anyone's gonna be able to hear. So, Dennis and Dee Reynolds here. Inaugural podcast. We're talking technology today. The big "T." Absolutely. Everyone's talking about technology these days because it's everywhere.
 Oh, it is- You can't escape it.
 You absolutely can't. So, Dee, tell us what you feel about technology. What's your opinion on it? My opinion? Dead air!
 Could you ease up on the crackers?
 I'm gettin' bored with this!
 I'm gonna bring my guest in.
 Guest?
 I asked Cricket to come. Cricket. He's outside.
 Cricket? No! You can't bring guests in here! This is our podcast! I feel like you're trying to take over! No, you know what? Actually this could bring up a pretty good issue. If you bring Cricket in here we could rail on him about the homeless issue.
 Cricket!
 Cricks.
 Yo.
 Come on in, buddy. We're ready for ya. Hey, Frank, where's my chicken? This is taking forever. Come on.
 I promised him a rotisserie chicken.
 Let's go. Chop-chop.
 I'm starving here.
 What's going on with your voice? It's from when Frank hit me with the trash can.
 Wound got infected. It was a whole ordeal.
 Ugh! Okay, all right, well, uh, listen, let's get into the issues here. We're gonna start rolling on this, Cricket. Oh, no, no, no, no. I am not saying another word until I get the chicken.
 I lied about the chicken, Crick.
 Are you kidding me?
 It was bullshit.
 Oh, my God. Unbelievable. Why do I even trust you? All right, wait a minute. Here. I do have something for you.
 Lemons.
 Lemons?
 Yeah. You suck on 'em.
 Oh, come on. At least give me the crackers.
 No, suck on a lemon. Here. Go ahead.
 Well, they are good for scurvy.
 I'll have a few lemons. But then I'm out of here.
 All right, here we go. So, uh, Dennis and Dee Reynolds here. We are talking about the homeless issue here in Philly. That's a big issue these days, and we're here with our friend Cricket. He is a homeless man. Cricket, walk us through a day in your life. Oh, a day in the life. Well, uh, the other morning I wake up, I find a dog sniffin' at my wound.
 Mmm.
 He's fully aroused, mind you. So I'm thinking, "Oh, great. What does this jerk want?" Course I know what he wants. He's lookin' at me right in the eyes. He does not have to say it. Not that he could. Oh, that is- that is tart! That is really tart. I mean, does my scar look like a dog's vagina? You know? Maybe. I don't know. I'm not gonna sit here and try to get inside the mind of a dog. I mean, that's God's work. Well, not that I believe in God. I don't. Not since that Chinaman stole my kidney.
 Cricket, tell Dee how much you think she's ugly.
 That's not gonna make sense. He doesn't think I'm ugly. He's madly in love with me.
 Don't flatter yourself. I'm over you, sister.
 Since when? Since I found out you are a whore.
 Will you stop talking about this! This has nothing to do Ohh! Well, maybe you're a whore, you stupid, ugly, homeless bitch!
 Zing!
 A dog banged your neck the other day!
 You're both whores!
 This is great radio! At least someone's banging my vagina! Get into it! Get into it! This is not good radio! All right. Okay, this is exciting, Mac! This is exciting!
 You know? You're- What are you doing?
 Huh?
 Will you take this seriously?
 I am taking it seriously. This is your big moment, man. You gotta walk out to center ice and you gotta be like, "Hey! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!"
 U.S.A!
 Not like that. Make it classy. Okay, but keep in mind I am gonna be wearing the duster. Of course you're gonna wear the duster. That's gonna look awesome.
 Thanks.
 Yeah. You should probably also be wearing a wig.
 A wig?
 Totally. Long, flowing hair. That's gonna look way more dramatic. You know what I mean? Okay, I like the wig idea in spirit. The problem is, I'll have to wear the wig to the beach house so people will recognize me. Next thing you know, I'm wearing a wig for the rest of my life just to keep up appearances. Yeah, like Andre Agassi, huh? Yeah. Right. I don't wanna do that. I don't know. Let's not rule it out. A good hockey wig could put this thing over the top, man.
 Okay, fine. Let's do this! Come on, dude!
 Let's do this thing!
 We'll take some shots.
 What else are we here for, dude? Let's do some shots!
 All right, you ready?
 Let's see what you got. Haunch. What was that? All right, well, that would have been cool if I was standing backwards. You're not gonna stand backward. You're gonna stand forward. You're gonna
 What the hell are you two doing out here?
 Don't worry about it, bro.
 We're prac
 You can't be out here swinging hockey sticks. You're not even supposed to be out here without skates. Now get out!
 All right

 Out! Okay! We're leavin'. You know what, Charlie? I think he's right, dude. Only a couple of jabronis come out here without skates on. I gotta do this thing in skates. You know, work up a routine, really jazz the crowd.
 Can I stop you though?
 Yeah. You keep using this word "jabroni." And it's awesome!
 It's like the coolest word I- Is that a hockey thing?
 Yeah- N- I don't know.
 I think it's some dago word, but it sounds like a hockey word.
 It does
 You're gonna want to brush up on your hockey words. At the beach house you're gonna be hanging out with the Flyers. Okay, we are back. Dennis and Dee Reynolds here. We're back to the podcast.
 We got a little derailed earlier.
 We did. We did. But that's okay. We're gonna get back on track here.
 I got a hot topic that I wanna talk about, Dee.
 Tell me what it is. This is something I'm pretty charged up about. It's stem cell research.
 Good one. Excellent one.
 It's a very divisive issue these days.
 People are really going to town, one side against the other.
 Oh, absolutely.
 Some people are for it, some people are against it

 What is that? What are you doing?
 That was a duck.
 Why would you make a duck noise right in the middle of my thing?
 It was funny.
 Yeah, but you derailed us.
 I thought I'd up the production value, add some sound effects.
 Well, don't.
 Okay, well
 So, stem cell research- Stop.
 Stem cell research is a very
 Why are you still pu

 Stop pushing sound effects. I want to talk about ser

 Which one is that one?
 This one. That's a laser beam. Yeah.
 I like that one. I wanna pepper that one in.
 Okay.
 Don't do it while I'm talking.
 All right, well, we'll see.
 Hello.
 Hey! Frank!
 That's Frank Reynolds, everybody!
 I have a great topic for you.
 War.
 War!
 War? Good one!
 Yeah. Yeah! Everyone's talking about the war. And I have the perfect guest.
 Huh.
 Okay. All right.
 Ben the soldier.
 Hey, Dee. Good to see you. What are you doing? No. No, no, no. I'm not comfortable with this. Okay, Ben is a soldier. He's in the war- probably. Not now, obviously, unless the war is happening here. Is the war happening here? I don't know! Let's get into all this stuff. Ben the soldier is here with us, folks, and I want to talk to him because, Ben, it's my understanding that there is a war going on right now. Am I
 Am I right in this? Well, actually there are two wars right now.
 Two war

 You don't say.
 We're in the midst of two wars?
 Huh! Now, the United States of America is engaged in both of these wars? Yes. Yes, they are. And, uh, are either of these wars happening on U.S., uh, soil? Excuse me. Let me- Let me

 What is your job in the war?
 Let me just

 Are you a carrier of- of, uh, large weaponry?
 Let me just interr
 How 'bout if we talk about how you used to bang each other?
 Yeah

 No
 What kind of technique did you use? Tie-ups and stuff like that.
 Frank, it's not good radio.
 'Cause people like sex. Okay, well, I just want to clarify. What my producer, Frank, is referring to is the fact that Ben, our soldier here and Dee used to be lovers.
 Hey! That's a good one!
 Don't do that to me. That's not funny.
 You're in the hot seat, girl.
 I'm not in the hot seat! Ben's in the hot seat! All right, Mac, so you're gonna come on the ice and fire out to center. Right? Do, like, a cool turn, get the crowd going!
 Okay. So, fire out

 C- Come on!
 Huh?
 What are you d

 Huh?
 That's not cool! Wait. Do you not know how to ice skate? No, not at all. But I figured you would teach me, 'cause we got plenty of time. We don't have time! It's tomorrow night, man! Charlie, you gotta help me, dude. This is my big break. Come on! Oh, my God! All right, we got a lot of work to do. All right, here. Grab the stick.
 Ready?
 Uh-huh. And we'll start slow. Oh, my

 This is gonna take forever, man.
 That's good. That's good. That's good. I'm skating. # Push it to the limit # # Limit # # Walk along the razor's edge # # But don't look down # # Just keep your head or you'll be finished # # Open up the limit # # Limit # # Past the point of no return # # You've reached the top # # But still you gotta learn #
 # How to keep it #
 Charlie, don't! Don't! Don't! # Hit the wheel and double the stakes # # Throttle wide open like a bat out of hell # # You crash the gates # # Crash the gates # # Going for the back of beyond # # Nothin 'gonna stop you There's nothin' that strong # Send it on in!

 # Push it to the limit #
 # The limit, the limit, the limit, the limit # Okay, next guest! All right, Dennis, let's get this over with. Don't bring her in here stinkin' up the joint. Come on. Frank said you were gonna apologize to me. Oh! Who's in the hot seat now?
 Let's not push too many of those. You're abusing it.
 It's gonna get not funny after a little while.
 No, no, that's good. So let me understand this, waitress. Uh, Frank promised you an apology from me. You didn't believe him, did you?
 Come on.
 Yeah. Really? Well, that makes you incredibly gullible and stupid. Oh! Oh, oh! Don't take that from him.
 Are you gonna take that from him? Stand up for yourself! I'm not leaving here until you apologize to me. Yeah? Well, you're gonna be here for a while. She's boring me. I'll give you 50 bucks if you take off your top and you drink soup out of my shoe.
 What?
 Okay, now that I'd like to see. Yeah, yeah, me too. What do you say, sister? You need some extra cash?
 No.
 500 bucks. Cricket, bring her some soup. You're gonna pay me $500 to drink soup out of a shoe. And take your top off. Fine.
 Oh!
 I'll do it.
 Nice!
 But I am not taking my top off.
 Well, that's a relief to all of us.
 Ooh!
 Zing!
 Zinged her! Gotcha! Couldn't find soup, but I found some dirty dishwater.
 Boom! Even better!
 I am not drinking dishwater.
 Oh, come on.
 Dump it on her head.
 What?
 Yes!
 Whoa!
 Oh, my God! Hold it- Ugh! Oh, now this is good radio! Holy shit, dude. There's a lot of people here. I'm getting nervous, Charlie. Yeah, you might throw up when you get out there, you know, from the nerves. You're supposed to be my coach, dude. Don't tell me I'm gonna throw up!
 I know, but people do that, so try not to throw up.
 Oh, come on, dude.
 Mac! Charlie! What's up, man?
 You guys came to support me!
 Uh, yeah! Yeah!
 Oh- Yeah, that was

 Yeah, yeah, that's why we're here.
 Primarily, yeah. But also, since we're here we wanted to give you this tape so you could give it to those radio guys. That's our demo tape. We were recording the whole thing on a computer. But then the computer got water dumped all over it. It was a whole thing.
 "Luther Vandross"?
 Is that still on there?
 Oh, that's very off-putting, Dennis.
 We should have relabeled it.
 It's not Luther Vandross.
 Make sure you tell 'em it's not Luther Vandross. Let's get going! Mac from South Philly, get out here!
 This is you!
 Oh! Here we go. Here we go. Everybody say a prayer. Let's do this. Give 'em the tape.
 What is that?
 The future of radio, you jabronis. "Jabronis." Cool word. Score! He did it! Mac from South Philly has cemented himself as a Philly sports legend! Let's hear it for Mac! Mac! Mac! Mac! Mac! Mac! Mac! Mac! Mac! Mac! Mac! Mac! Mac! Mac! Mac! Mac! Mac! Mac! Mac! Mac! Mac! Wake up! Mac! Mac! Mac! Wake up! Mac, wake up! What happened? Did I do good, Charlie? No. You fell on your face almost immediately, man.
 Who took the shot?
 I took the shot. Yeah, I missed wide right by, like, a mile. It was terrible. Look on the bright side, dude. I think you're gonna be a sports celebrity after all 'cause they're definitely gonna play that shit on ESPN.                     Yo! Hey! Bro, help us out here! Swim time! It's a heat wave, dude!
 Heat wave!
 Heat wave! Heat wave!
 I'm sorry about that. Can I help you?
 Yeah, two checking in for the pool.
 Check us in. Sorry, sir. You can't bring beer onto the premises. What? You can't drink in this pool?
 That's kind of weird.
 Charlie, chug this.
 Yeah, we'll pound 'em.
 We'll just have to finish these out here.
 Here. Help us out. The boss isn't around.
 No. I'm-I'm good.
 All right. More for us.
 You sure? I'm sure. Yeah. I'm gonna assume you guys aren't members here. Just go ahead and sign us up.
 We'll blaze through these in no time.
 Yeah. Actually, if you'd like to join our swim club you need to be sponsored by two existing members. But I'm sorry to tell you, fellas that membership is currently at capacity.
 At capacity?
 Yeah. We're in the middle of a terrible heat wave and you happen to be at capacity- for us. Well, you can try the public pool, but
 Oh, thank you. Thank you for your suggestion.
 We're out of here. Let's go.
 Yeah.
 You.
 You don't have to- Oh. Sir. I cannot believe that that just happened, in this day and age. I know. I can't believe there's such a big list. Mm-mmm. Don't you get it, dude? They'll always be "at capacity" for us. I don't get that at all. Is that what he said? Don't you get it? We got big-timed, dude. He called us lower class.
 He called us lower class?
 Yeah. Yeah, but I wouldn't argue with that, dude. We're definitely lower class. Yeah, I'm not disputing that fact, dude. I'm saying we shouldn't get boxed out for it. It's bullshit. Honestly, I just wanna go swimming. Should we suck it up and go to the public pool? Ugh! Gross, dude. I will not go to that disgusting public pool. People there are gross. I got a good idea. Let's get out of here. There she is. This is what I'm talking about, bro. Man, the old diving pool. Remember how much fun we used to have here?
 It's all deep end.
 Hell, yeah, we had fun, dude. You know why? Because this was a pool for people like us. Street guys. And I think it's clear why it looks like shit now. 'Cause Jamie Nelson drowned in it. What? No. No, I was gonna say it was because of a pattern of discrimination because this was a pool for lower-class people.
 Dude, what?
 Yeah. Look, dude, I say it's time we take matters into our own hands with this.
 What you thinking?
 I'm saying we fix up this pool. Ahh! Man, I'm gonna have to keep tinkering with the A.C. 'cause I can't feel it at all. Can you feel it? Charlie, you gotta focus, okay? A pool is a major investment. So if we're gonna get Frank on board with this we have to approach him as equals.
 Okay. Is that why you got that gold chain?
 That's why I got the gold chain. Okay. I see what you're going after here.
 Hey, Frank!
 Yeah. We have a little bit of a presentation for you. Can you come down? Oh, what's up? What's with the sheet? Not just yet, okay? Please, have a seat. Charlie, get Frank a beer.
 Don't do airplane noises. Just give him the beer.
 Good move.
 Why don't we get beers? Because you're not even supposed to be here.
 Frank is the audience. Just keep your mouth shut.
 Sheet, sheet, sheet. Okay, ready. Hey, ho, here we go! Boom! Pool! Charlie and I found this abandoned pool that we used to swim in when we were kids.
 It's full of branches and shit.
 It's a big mess. If we have a little bit of money, we can clean it up

 Pass.
 Just let me finish.
 I have a whole thing Pass. It's too much work. What else you got? Is this 'cause you guys are still all pissed off about not getting into that swim club? If you guys were there, you would know how we feel. No, no, no. Stop yourself right there. We would not know how it feels 'cause Dee and I would have waltzed right into that swim club. Yeah, you don't lump Dennis and me in with you. We're high class, so
 You should've seen this guy. He would have lumped the shit out of you.
 We live in the same apartment.
 Let me explain to you guys a little something about how class works. You're born into class. It's about pedigree. It's about upbringing. It has nothing to do with your present circumstances. Dennis and I were born upper class and therefore we currently are and will forever remain upper class. Frank, stop picking your teeth for one second and back us up on this. I quit on that shit. You understand? I quit on it. I don't give a rat's ass about class. I live on the fringe. Fringe class is where I am. You're in the fringe class. I still maintain that Dee and I are in the upper class. All this talk has really got me thinking about taking a dip.
 I'm hot as shit, Dee.
 Oh, yeah. We could go pop a hydrant.
 We'd beat the heat that way.
 I'm not popping shit. That's about as low class as it gets. Dee?
 Swim club.
 Swim club.
 Later, bitches.
 Okay. Sorry, sir. We are at capacity. Capacity? That is unbelievable that you would use the word "capacity" with us. We truly could not admit you, even if you had the sponsors, which you don't. Well, we know you. You could sponsor us. I don't know what kind of idea you have about us, but we, sir, are like you. Uh, send a little something sweet his way maybe.
 Oh. A little sweetness, huh?
 Want a little something sweet?
 If that's the only language he understands.
 In the mood for sweets? Sir, please, you're just embarrassing yourself now. Oh, I'm embarrassing? I'm embarrassing myself? Said the elitist pool guy. Dee, I don't even think I'd want to be a part of some exclusionary pool club propagated by this-this man, this-this hatemonger. Oh, yeah, I'm with you. I bet you don't even have any black people here. Excuse me, ma'am, but there is an African-American family right there. Well, good for you. You keep a couple of token ones around, do you?
 Parade 'em around like dancing monkeys?
 Right. Oh, no

 I didn't mean it like that.
 Monkeys?
 It's a phrase that means performing on command.
 It's a phrase.
 It-It-It

 Listen. You are more than happy to try the public pool. Oh, can we? Well, maybe we will. Yeah, because we have class. And having class means being able to mix with people that are beneath you.
 Mm-hmm.
 Come on. Your shirt doesn't even fit, by the way. If you wanna be an elitist, get yourself a tailor. Oh.
 Oh! Oh!
 No, Dee, that's
 Severely lacking in class.
 Yeah. Too much? My bad. Got carried away. Oh, Jesus Christ. This is like a goddamn zoo. Uh, there's a very disturbing lack of adults here. That girl just jumped in with her sneakers on. These people all have sneakers on. You know what's happening here? We're just experiencing a little bit of culture shock. These people are very different from the people that are at our normal pool environment and this whole environment is very different. And that's okay. That's okay. It's not a bad thing.
 Dennis. Deandra.
 What are you doing here? I tried to pop a hydrant, but there was no lookout, so I got shut down. I see that you have a towel. Where did you get that? I don't see any attendants around here. Oh, I bartered fringe style with that guy over there. I gave him a bite of my hot dog, he's letting me use his towel.
 Want a bite?
 No.
 Yo, Mac!
 Yeah. Hey, dude. I think this right here has got "keeper pile" written all over it. We could probably set some of this up strategically to represent where all the cool shit in the pool's gonna be. Like this rusty bike frame? We could be, like, "That's where the swim-up bar is."
 Swim-up bar. That's good, dude.
 Yeah. Man, I got a whole plan. We'll dip one of those cans with the string on it into the water and when we're underwater, we'll place our order. "Two beers, please. " And when we swim up to the top, Dennis hands them to us. Well, I was thinking we'd be at capacity for Dennis but I guess if he's serving us, then that makes him lower than us, so that's cool. He'll be lower than us. Don't worry about that. I don't wanna put a tin can in the water with a string 'cause we're not eight. I just thought it'd be cool. Put it in your ear. Put it in your mouth. Yeah, that's not cool, but

 Well, it's classy.
 Neither. All right. Well, you wanna pop down here and help me chuck this mattress out?
 Yeah.
 It's the last big thing I got. Yeah, we'll get all of this out of here. Ooh! God, dude, it's really squishy. Yeah, it's covered in chlorine water, but it's clean. There hasn't been chlorine in here since Jamie Nelson. But it's probably like raw sewage that's been sitting here. Yeah, it's got a sewagey smell.
 Yeah. All right.
 Let's just chuck it out. Ready?
 Yeah, let's get it out of here.
 Give it a boost.
 You ready?
 One, two, three. Whoo!
 I'm strong, dude.
 I'm definitely getting stronger.
 Whoo!
 Wow, dude. This pool is sweet, man. It's super deep. Yeah, I know. I know. Yeah. Hey, dude, um, how have you been getting in and out of here? I was climbing up the mattress
 sort of like a ladder-type situation. Aw, shit. Well
 Are we stuck in here? I think we're stuck. Help!
 Help!
 Help!
 Come on!
 Come on, man. I can't even make out an angle to do a lap or anything.
 Ow! Son of a bitch!
 Wha-Wha-What? I just stepped on broken glass. Ow! Oh, my God. There are shards of broken glass all over the bottom of the pool. Well, now I know why people are wearing shoes.
 Yeah. Now the shoes make a lot of sense.
 Okay. Frank. What in the hell are you doing with that watermelon, man?
 You ever play this game?
 No. You grease the watermelon up, you throw it in the pool. Everybody goes crazy trying to grab it. They can't grab it. Greased watermelon!
 Here it comes! Try to grab it!
 Oh, no! Come on. Come on. Ugh. I can't believe you borrowed hot dog guy's towel.
 Yeah, well, I'm not proud of it.
 Gross.
 I have a proposition.
 I have a proposition too. Let me walk in front of you so you don't get your blood all over my feet. That's fair. Why don't we call Mac and Charlie? I just feel like their pool has gotta be better than this. No. We don't want them to know we didn't get into the private swim club.
 Oh, son of a bitch!
 What? Which one of you little shits stole my shoes? Goddamn it! I'm putting out a feeler call. Stride, stride, stride, stride, execute. Ah! Ah! Okay. I think I see what the problem is though. This move is intended for a back flip and what I need to do is a front flip. If you needed a back flip, I'd be up that wall in a second, bro.
 No, you just wouldn't

 Yeah. You just would not because you don't know how to do a back flip.
 Charlie, I do back flips every single day of my life.
 No, you don't. I have never seen you- Do a back flip right now. Can I see one? Let's see one. Well, I need to stay focused and conserve energy, and that's, you know- Come on. What if I need to do a back flip later? You're not gonna need to! You need to do some kind of flip now! And you don't know how 'cause you don't know how to flip or do karate! All you know how to do is talk me into doing shit
 Where I get stuck in a pool where I'm definitely gonna die! Oh, wait. My phone's ringing. Hang on. My phone's ringing. You've had a cell phone this entire time, dude? Are you kidding me? Shh. Yello! Hey, Charlie. Hey. Dennis and I were just
 No, no. Leave my name out of it. It's Dee and Dennis, dude. They'll rescue us.
 No, dude. Do not tell them that we're stuck in here.
 Why? Because getting stuck in an abandoned pool is extremely low class. Dennis will sink his teeth into it. I feel like if I talk to him, it's gonna slip out.
 Just don't let it slip out.
 But I kind of wanna tell him.
 Just give me the phone.
 We're stuck in a pool! Shh, shh. It's Mac. How's it going over there in your, uh, deserted mine shaft or whatever? It's pretty sweet here. Okay? It's very private. Probably way more private than your piece-of-shit pool. Really? Well, I doubt that, you know. Is that Mexican music? Oh, the music. Uh, you know, that's- it's- You know what it is. It's one of the attendants. He's walking around with a ghetto blaster serving us drinks and just making us comfortable, giving us hats. Uh- Uh
 Why does it sound so echoey over there? Nothing but relaxation going on over here.
 It's very relaxey.
 We're stuck in the pool! And, uh, that's probably what you're hearing is the relaxation. Hey! Hey! Those are my shoes! What? Uh, the attendant, you know, he just walked off with my shoes and
 it made me mad because he didn't ask.
 But

 But
 But it's great because in the end I'm gonna end up with polished shoes. You know how it goes. Okay, bye. Damn it, dude. That private pool's awesome. They have attendants. Oh, my God. Who's in attendance? How many people? She didn't say anything
 No, people that wait on them hand and foot.
 Oh, my God. Really?
 Yes. Oh, my God. Dude, since when do you have a cell phone? I buy 'em all the time. You prepay for it, and then you buy it and you throw it away.
 There's a name for it.
 A burner?
 A burner! That's a burner.
 This is what drug dealers buy.
 Oh, really?
 This is a very specific sect of lower class, okay? This is like- This is like felon class.
 Felon class, huh?
 God! All right, okay, so let me see. Who are we gonna call? We can't call the police because

 We're trespassing.
 Yeah. I got an idea. Let's order some food.
 Oh! Yeah.
 Yeah. And then we'll have the delivery guy come, and he can help us out. Perfect. And we can get some Chinese food 'cause that's the classiest poolside food you can have. Yeah, we probably shouldn't get Chinese though because those delivery guys are always Chinese and he won't understand a word we're saying
 And plus, he's probably gonna be too short.
 Ooh.
 Yeah.
 I could really go for some Chinese food though, man.
 That'd be good.
 But we're not actually eating the food.
 So I'm gonna eat the food, for sure. I'm starving. You know what, dude? Let me handle it. I'm gonna call pizza delivery. Pizza. We're gonna get some pizza. It'll be some big Italian lug, and he'll fish us out of here.
 Fish sounds good. See if they have fish there.
 I'll ask. This place is a shit-hole. I motion for Mac and Charlie's pool.
 It just didn't sound like it was that bad over there.
 Look there is absolutely no way in hell I'm letting Mac and Charlie know that we didn't get into that swim club. Ow!
 What?
 What the hell?
 What? What happened?
 What was that?
 What?
 That's a rock, Dennis. These kids are throwing rocks at each other for fun. What kind of savages throw rocks at each other to have fun times? I am done with this place. We need to take another run at that swim club. Yeah, well, we better before I lose it and I drown a child. Here you go. We ate the watermelon. Butter me up. I'm gonna be the watermelon and jump in the pool. Do my back. I can't do my back. Go ahead. Get ready for a rock in the eye, bro. Ahh!
 Oh!
 Oh, no. Ow! That one really hurt.
 Truce, truce.
 That one really hurt.
 No more throwing rocks, right?
 Hello?
 Hello? Hello?
 Ho-ho!
 Hey! Hello!
 Hey! Hey, you guys order a pizza? You gotta be kidding me. He's Chinese. I know, but his English sounds pretty good, and he's big too, right? Hey, we're stuck in this pool, dude. Can you help us out?
 Is this a prank?
 No, no. Look, dude, we'll pay you first, and then help us out of here.
 Charlie, you got some cash?
 Uh, no. Shit. Check your front pockets. What are you doing? I cut them off 'cause they were overshooting the bottom of my shorts.
 Forget it. I'm out of here.
 No, no, wait!
 We'll give you a gold chain.
 Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah.
 Toss it up.
 Okay.
 There you go.
 Toss that pizza down too. I'm starving.
 Wanna get some of this pizza?
 We might as well. I haven't eaten.
 Here it is.
 Oh!
 No! Dude!
 Sorry. Hey, bro, just toss down that hose, then you can pull us up.
 See that hose right there?
 That'd be good. Just pull us up.
 Here you go.
 That's it. All right. Here we go. Ah, that's perfect. That's perfect. Hey, this chain's fake as shit, man. I'm sorry, dude. He's white trash.
 Don't take it personally. Don't take it personally.
 I'm out of here.
 Pull us up!
 Don't go! All right, whatever. No problem. No problem.
 You can just climb it.
 I'm just gonna climb right up.
 All right. Climb up.
 Stand back, 'cause it takes a real man to do this. You ready, bro? Oh! Whoa! Aw, man! Oh, dude.
 All right, that's it. I'm calling Dennis.
 No. Don't you understand? This pool is our bootstraps and it's lifting us up into the middle class, dude. Well, just accept the fact that you're white trash, all right? Take a look at yourself. You can't do back flips. You don't know karate. You're white trash! You're white trash too, dude. Those shorts are white trash. Do not call the shorts white trash. Dennis told me about these shorts. They're not white trash. Look at this. Look at this. Look what I can do. What is white trash about that? Don't call me white trash. I feel like if I had that kind of mobility I'd be capable of almost, well, pretty much anything. Well, yeah, maybe then you could get the flip.
 Although I really doubt it.
 I could probably get that flip.
 Can we just call Dennis?
 Fine. Call Dennis. Yeah- Oh, shit, dude. I put the phone in my front pocket. Goddamn it. How is this gonna work? We look bad. We're getting in this pool if it's the last thing we do. We just need two sponsors, and we'll get in. Don't worry. You don't think we should go home and take a shower first?
 We don't have time to take a shower. Here we go.
 Oh. Hey, hey!
 Hi, family, little ones.
 Hey! Hi, Mom. Sorry to jump out in front of you. But there is a bit of a heat wave going on in Philly right now.
 It's a terrific heat wave, and it's affecting everybody.
 It really is. And we were looking to cool down a little bit. This pool, that'd be a great place for us to cool off. Oh, yeah. And you know what? We just need a couple of sponsors. Yeah, a couple of sponsors. Hey, Dee, you're bleeding a little bit. Is it bleeding? Is it happening? Kids, don't touch the blood. Hey, guys, I got kicked out of that other pool. This Filipino lady went crazy on me. She started scratching me like a velociraptor. It stings like- Ah! Excuse me. What is happening here? These people are bleeding all over the place.
 We're not bleeding all over the place.
 All over the place? Mrs. Baines, I am sorry if they were harassing you.
 Please have a wonderful day. We'll see you very soon.
 Hey, kids. Listen, buddy, you gotta let us in the pool. It's so hot. Try to understand. We are at capacity. We're not at capacity, 'cause I can see the pool from here. We are at capacity, sir!
 I'm jumping in the pool!
 Yeah. Plus I'm gonna piss in it. I'm jumping in the pool! All right. You see, Charlie, this is a proper memorial. I think Jamie Nelson would have liked this. Yeah. I like the skateboard, 'cause Jamie loved skateboarding.
 He did like skateboarding.
 Not much of a swimmer.
 Not a very good swimmer. No, he wasn't.
 No. Okay, well, I think we can both agree that we need to make sure that his spirit does not haunt us. Yes. We definitely wanna ward off his spirit.
 So if you know any voodoo or whatever, go ahead and Should we join hands? Well, it's not called voodoo, okay? This is the Lord our Savior.
 All right. Okay.
 Okay, here we go. Lamb of God who takes away
 What is that? There's a lamb?
 Charlie, let me do my thing.
 I'll just let you do your thing. All right. Lamb of God who taketh away the souls of the world
 Don't take his soul and get his soul out. You don't have to provide any kind of
 Let me just do my thing. I just wanna be sure we get that spirit out of here. # Lamb of God who takes away the sins of # Alligator tooth and snakeskin

 Don't undermine my prayer with voodoo.
 Okay. Prayer.
 Don't do it.
 I won't do it.
 # Lamb of God who takes- #
 Alligator tooth and snakeskin spirit take this spirit out of this pool. If you're not gonna take this seriously
 I'm taking it perfectly seriously.
 Where the hell is

 Oh! Nice. This place is a shit-hole, huh? I don't know why I thought it would look any different.
 Get your spirit out of here.
 Hey, guys.
 Hey! What the hell are you doing down there?
 Nothing. We're just hanging out.
 We got stuck in this
 Shut up. Shut up. We're good. We're good. We're good. We're good. We're just chillin'. This is pathetic. The word "trashy" just doesn't even do it justice. Whatever. What are you guys even doing here? Go back to your fancy pool. We're fine. Fancy pool got old after a while. Wait a second. You guys didn't get into the pool, did you?
 What?
 What? Oh, my God. You sons of bitches. You didn't get in. Admit that you are low class, just like us. I'm not admitting shit because I did get into that pool.
 I just got tired of swimming in it.
 Then why are you here?
 Why are you piping in, trash? You shut your mouth, trash.
 You're swimming in this
 Why are you calling me trash? I defended you earlier 'cause of these shorts. You're the ones that are trash. Sitting in the bottom of a pool that's filled with trash, like trash. You guys are white trash. Admit it right now. I hope you trash bags die at the bottom of this pool like Jamie Nelson did.
 Don't bring Jamie Nelson into this!
 Forget about it. Stop it. Just stop it. I think I have a way for us to beat the heat tonight Philly style. Yeah!
 Oh, yes!
 Hit us, baby! Dee, get the cup.
 Get the cup.
 Oh, yeah. Oh, yes! All right! All right! Yeah! Watch your balls.                     Dee, what are you doing? I got a tickle, a really bad one. Shit. Are you getting sick? If you're getting sick, stay away from us. No, no, no. I'd better not be getting sick. I can't be getting sick.
 I gotta be able to talk to Groban tomorrow.
 Who? Josh Groban. Artemis and I got backstage passes to his concert in the park tomorrow. Charles Grodin is coming in concert, and you didn't tell us? Aw! We love Charles Grodin. That dude is hysteri- I love that guy.
 He brings out the curmudgeon in me.
 Yeah. No, no. Different guy. Josh Groban is who I'm talking about. Josh Groban. Oh. Is he Charles Grodin's son? He's probably funny. What do you think? If he's related to Charles Grodin, he is. Don't worry about that. Yeah, two totally different people. Charles Grodin is a bitter old man with a giant head and Josh Groban is a beautiful singer with the voice of an angel. Oh, he's a singer. Call Charles Grodin a bitter old man one more time, and see what happens!
 Ooh, ooh, calm down.
 All right. All right. Sorry. All right. No big deal. I got to go home anyway. I should rest. Stay aw- Come on.
 No. Don't come near me. Don't make me sick.
 All right. All right.
 Don't touch me with that. Hey! Stop it.
 Don't make me sick. Mom, Mom! Calm down! Calm down! Listen to me. Okay, here's what you do, okay? You close the curtains, and you mind your own business, right? No, they're not terrorists! They're just Muslims. Okay, well, I'm gonna hang up, okay? Hanging up. Unbelievable, dude. Ever since my Uncle Jack moved out, my mom's going crazy. She's like, "Help me with this. Help me with that. Wash the floor. Wash the ceiling. Clean my car. Get this. Fix that. Are there spiders here? Are there spiders there?" I'm sorry. The woman who brought you into the world and raised you needs you and you're gonna ignore her? Dude, it's crazy shit. It's insane shit.
 And I can't be constantly taking care of her.
 I don't blame you, man. I'm very much looking forward to not taking care of anyone when I'm older. Well, what? What, you're not gonna take care of me when I'm old? Hell, no, I'm not gonna take care of you. You were a terrible father to me. I'll get Deandra to take care of me. She'll take care of me. Dee's not gonna take care of you. You chased her out with a pool cue because she had a cough. Forget about it.
 That's her.
 Answer the phone, Charlie.
 I'm just gonna let it ring, 'cause it's crazy shit.
 Answer the goddamn phone!
 It's not anything serious, Mac!
 Just answer
 What? Hello? What? What is it? Ye- Yeah. Oh, well, that is a serious thing. Okay. I'll let him know. Uh, Mac, your mom burned her house down. Hey-oh! Good news, Dennis. Mom's okay. She fell asleep with a lit cigarette in her mouth and burned the entire house down but the good news is she's fine. Uh- Oh, great. Yeah.
 Um, where is she going to be staying?
 Here, of course. I'll stay in a shelter.
 Hey, there's an idea! Shelter.
 Absolutely not. Okay. What about a nice nursing home? Nursing home? Do you have any idea what happens in those places, dude? Why don't I just rape her myself? Rape her? What are you talking about? What? Yo, got your dog. Poppins! Hey, buddy! How you doing? Poppins? My God, I can't believe that dog's not dead.
 Didn't you get him when you were, like, 10?
 Oh, yeah. This dog is indestructible, dude. Yeah, that dog's nasty, man. He was coughing the whole way over here. He ate cigarette butts off the ground. He's got a wheeze. He might have emphysema, man. Oh, that's entirely possible. Yeah, it wouldn't slow him down though. He's a survivor. He would disappear for months, but he would always come home. Yeah, it looks like his eye is falling out.
 Is it? When it just bulges?
 It bulges out a little bit there. You just pop it back in with your knuckle. I'll show you how to do it.
 I'm never going to do that.
 You're gonna touch his eye with your knuckle? You just sort of pop it back in. Oh. Hang on a second. What, Mom, what? I'm not gonna vacuum your ceiling. Um, because I already did it, okay? Plastic splinters are the same as
 You won't get a splinter!
 I gotta go deal with this.
 No. Hold on a second.
 It's back in, Dennis. Check it out.
 I don't care. I have an idea that's gonna solve all of our problems here. Your moms are gonna live together. Now hear me out. This is gonna be great. Okay, Mac, your mom burned down her house with a cigarette, right? Uncle Jack moved out of your mom's house, so she's lonely. She's got no one to talk to. Boom. Mrs. Mac, your mom- together. Could be the perfect situation. Come on. They could be like The Golden Girls. A couple of old ladies getting together, chasing men, eating cheesecake.
 That'd be cool.
 Sure. Whatever. I'm loving that idea, but my mom's gonna be a tough sell, man. Uh-huh. I'll talk her into it. Oh, it popped back out.
 What the hell are you doing?
 What?
 What the hell are you doing?
 Oh, I went to the health food store. I just grabbed a whole bunch of shit. It's supposed to boost my immune system. I'm not gonna miss that show, Frank. I'm a Grobanite. Grobanites don't miss shows. Josh Groban comes to town, and we consider it a call to action. What you're saying is very dorky. Nevertheless, I brought you some stuff
 a little bit of care package here.
 Why?
 I want to make you well. I got you coffee, I got you some Mexican peanuts I got you some candy. I got you a Stud magazine. What's your angle? What are you doing? Deandra. We have to take care of each other. I'm gonna take care of you now, but when I'm old and sick, you have to take care of me. What? No! No, I'm not doing that. Absolutely not. You're on your own. That
 You okay? Yeah? No? It's down? It's going? It's going? Open up. Put your head back. Oh, God! Oh, God. I got it. All right. Well, you know what? You should go relax. You should go rest now. Good. Look, I'm gonna do everything you need. Anything you need, I will do it. Just make believe I'm your slave. Okay. Do my laundry.
 Done.
 All right. I'm gonna go rest.
 All right.
 Don't bother me. No, no, no, no. I'm gonna be as quiet as a mouse.
 You just rest, honey.
 Uh-huh. Okay. All right. Well, ladies, I know this is a lot to digest, and that's why I'm here
 to act as an unbiased negotiator in the process and to sort out any problems or concerns. Essentially, just to make sure that you're both comfortable with this new arrangement.
 I don't want to live with her.
 Oh, Mom! Why not?
 She smells.
 I know she smells.
 Okay, you can't talk about my mom like that!
 Okay. You don't smell, and you look beautiful, okay? I think what Charlie's mom is trying to say is that Mrs. Mac has a unique and earthy fragrance. I smell like shit. Okay, Mom, don't put yourself down, okay? We talked about this. Perhaps we could get Mrs. Mac some perfume? Oh, yeah. That's not a bad idea. Mrs. Mac, what do you say? What better way to kick off this new relationship than with a new fragrance? Stop talking to me like I'm an asshole!
 She can't smoke in here.
 I know, Mom. Uh
 Okay, okay. Well, that's- Now, Mrs. Mac, I would never ask you to give up tobacco but what if you were to switch to some sort of smokeless tobacco alternative?
 I know that grunt. She's open to it.
 Okay! So what do we say we do a little bit of a trial run tonight? Let's see what happens, and then we'll take it from there. Okay.
 That means absolutely.
 Okay!
 Oh, sweet.
 Okay!
 Great, great, great. So, last step
 Dog's tied up outside. I'll grab him, bring him inside, and then I'll be on my way. No. No! No dogs. Charlie, tell them. Okay. She is terrified of animals eating her face off. I don't want a dog to eat my face, Charlie!
 She doesn't want a dog eating her face.
 Well, you know what? That's not a problem. We'll take the dog- you and I. Oh, I think what Mac is trying to say is not that we'll take the dog
 I'm saying exactly what I want to say. What Mac's trying to say now is that you're taking the dog. What Charlie's saying is correct. We're taking the dog.
 We're not taking the dog.
 You're taking the dog. It's not going to eat my mother's face off. It's coming home with us, Dennis, so just accept it, all right? All right, all right, all right! Fine.
 We'll take the dog.
 Calm down. Laundry's done! Uh, those white shorts on top? That's part of my outfit for tomorrow, so why don't you go and run an iron over those? Ooh! Hey, very whitey white.
 Uh, you're not ragging it, are you?
 What? Gr

 Gross, Frank! Come on.
 You still get periods? What are you doing? Stop asking me that. What? Gross! Come on.
 I'm trying to bond with you.
 That's how you bond with me- asking if I still get periods? What's that stuff you're putting on? That's beautiful. What is it? Self-tanner, for tomorrow. Got to look good for Groban. The, uh, tan's gonna make the white in the outfit pop the white's gonna make the tan pop. Josh Groban likes his ladies to pop, so
 Hey, hey, hey, hey! Look who I brought. It's Poppins!
 Yeah.
 Oh, God.
 That's Poppins?
 Ooh, yeah!
 He's still alive?
 Oh, yeah, yeah. I figured he could keep you company while you're sick.
 Dog looks like a gargoyle.
 Yeah. He smells like piss.
 Does it? Uh-oh. Is he dying?
 No, no, no, he's fine. You're gonna want to keep him away from that cream, too, 'cause he'll eat that shit. He ate a whole bottle of shampoo at our apartment earlier. He loves shit like that.
 Wow. Sounds great.
 Yeah.
 Thanks for bringing him over, yeah.
 He's a great dog. I'm gonna finish this up in my bedroom. Frank, make me another juice, 'cause I feel like that green stuff's really working.
 You got it.
 Great. So, you'll keep the dog here, and then, uh
 What are you doing, Frank? What's going on here? Trying to score brownie points with your sister. I mean, I need somebody to take care of me when I'm old and sick. Jesus. You're still worried about that? Why don't you check yourself into a nursing home? You have the money. I'm not gonna put myself into one of those crypts. As soon as you drop the soap, they rape your butt.
 What?
 That's what happens. Mac told me. God! You people have a very strange conception of what goes on in nursing homes. Frank, green juice, now! The bitch is driving me crazy! She's not even sick anymore. I support your plan, Frank, insofar as it insures that I won't have to take care of you when you get older but you're going about this all wrong, honestly.
 How do you mean?
 Well, for one thing, she's in her apartment. She's comfortable here. She's on her home turf. She's got all of her amenities. She feels good here. She doesn't need you here. You need to thrust her into a hostile environment so that she needs you to protect her.
 I should dump her under the bridge!
 Dump her under the bri
 No, don't dump her down by the bridge. What are you talking
 No, you need to be there, Frank. That's the whole point of this. Just take her to your apartment. Now, secondly, if this is gonna work then she's gonna need to feel more than just a tickle in her throat. So, if she's not feeling sick, well then we're just gonna have to make her feel sick.
 You're good.
 Well, I'm a fixer, Frank.
 You're good.
 That's what I do. Dennis, listen. We should hang out more together. Yeah. Stop trying to bond with me.
 They're not even talking to each other.
 My mom's not very verbal. I know, but they haven't even touched their cheesecake. I feel like if you and I were in a room with a perfectly good cheesecake all sorts of conversation would start happening. Oh, Charlie, the funniest thing happened today when I was doing the laundry. Mom, no, not me. You got to talk to her, okay? Don't talk to me. Pretend like we're not even here, Mrs. Kelly, okay?
 Go gossip.
 About what? Maybe you were at a supermarket one time, and you met a cute guy and you were feeling saucy and then you wanted to go back and talk to your friend, Sophia. So you're like Blanche, and she's like Sophia. So, go ahead. I don't go to the supermarket. The shopping carts are dangerous. Shopping carts are not dangerous, Mom. There's nothing dangerous about a shopping cart! Let's try a new tack. Everybody, calm down. This isn't working. All right. TV's going off. Boom! Okay! That's good! You guys are roommates now, so maybe you can get to know one another.
 I'm hot.
 My mom's hot. I'm hot too. I got to be honest. I'm hot as well. Can we turn the fan on? Okay, well, the fan is broken. It hasn't worked for years. Oh! Oh, okay! That's good! My mom's very good with her hands. Maybe she can fix it.
 Oh, yeah?
 Mom was the manager at Jiffy Lube for many years.
 I never heard about this.
 Yeah, well, she doesn't like to brag. It's not her style. But she started at the bottom, worked her way to the tippy top. There's only three people working at Jiffy Lube. It's not really a high climb. Well, please don't diminish my mother's achievements, okay? Don't get too excited about your mother's achievements. Mom, do you want to take a look at that fan and see if you can fix it? What was that? It means, "Not right now, but there's a possibility that I could get to it tomorrow." See, the problem is, once that sun goes down you're not gonna get this woman to do anything, 'cause she thrives on sunlight. She seems like she's never been in sunlight. Oh!
 That's nasty.
 Oh, Charlie, she's spitting into my porcelain. Okay, well, that makes you mad. Take it up with her!
 Have a conversation with her.
 Everybody, can we just- Let's relax for a second. Maybe I can get you, like, a beer bottle. Would that be okay? An empty beer bottle to spit in? Yeah? Okay, having fun. # Thank you for being a friend # # Traveled down the road and back again #
 # The heart is true #
 You gotta stare at her.
 # You're a pal and a confidante #
 Don't look at me!
 # And if you threw a party #
 Turn your head. # And invited everyone you knew, ooh-hoo # # You would see the biggest gift would be from me # # And the card attached would say # Look at her!
 She's zonked.
 Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. When she wakes up, she'll be really, really cold, so you just give her this blanket. You know, give her some more juice.
 Just be a dad to her.
 Oh, this is so boring. This is bullshit. I mean, God
 I mean, how long do I have to do this for? We've been here for, like, an hour, Frank. You're the worst dad. Groban!
 Ooh. She's up.
 I'll come find you. Okay. Daddy's here. Take it easy, honey. Okay, honey, don't get up. Stay right where you are.
 Gotta go to the show.
 Don't go by the knives.
 Let me backstage.
 She thinks she's going backstage. You sing so good.
 Honey, you want a blankie? I swaddle you, baby.
 I'll get to you.
 No, tomorrow night. That's not tonight.
 You sing in my ears.
 I love you when you sing.
 She thinks she's going to the concert?
 I don't know. She's walking.
 She's in a zombie state. She's going to bounce off all the walls.
 I've never seen anything like this. It's incredible.
 She's going outside. Ooh, she's going to hit the skateboard. Ooh.
 Wow. Did you see that?
 She's like Mr. Magoo.
 Ooh.
 Oh. Magoo never made that mistake. One, two, three. Good night, honey. Good night, Mac. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three.
 Mrs. Kelly?
 Yes? Why are you doing everything in threes? Oh. So Charlie doesn't die.
 What?
 One, two, three. One, two, three.
 That's crazy.
 Bat-shit crazy. I don't know, dude. What do you want me to say? The woman's out of her mind. Hey! Get the hell

 Is she waking up my mom?
 No! No, Mom! My mom does not like to be woken up, Mrs. Kelly!
 Shit! Get out of my room.
 Oh! Just one more. One more.
 One, two, three.
 Get out of here, goddamn it!
 Whoa. Whoa.
 Mom, go to bed! Oh, man, that was close. Now you see where I get my temper, huh? Yeah, one, two, three. One, two, three. Huh.
 What are you doing?
 Huh?
 What was that?
 Ah, you know, just playing it safe. She's been doing it. I'm still alive. Can't be crazy.
 Yeah, no, that's very crazy.
 One, two, three. One, two, three.
 It does feel good to do stuff in threes.
 Okay, you know what? I'm pulling the plug on this whole thing, all right?
 'Cause this and this- this has gotta stop.
 You're right. Tomorrow morning, I'm getting my mom out of here. Let's just go to bed.
 This has not been a good situation.
 Let's go to bed.
 This one look off to you? One, two, three.
 No, it's fine. It's fine. Hey, guys. We got some bagels and coffee. One, two, three. What do you think that's accomplishing? Here you go. Oh, Mom. Where's your chewing tobacco? You know Mrs. Kelly doesn't like the smoke. Oh, the ceiling fan is gonna push all the smoke outside the windows. Oh, yeah? Oh, she's fixing the fan? See? I told you, dude. My mom is very handy. Oh. The Muslims are back. Where do you think they're coming and going from? Damn foreigners! They ain't American, I don't want to know 'em.
 I know. I wish they'd all go back to the desert.
 Yeah!
 So it does seem like they're bonding, right?
 Yeah. It's not really a Golden Girls-type conversation. It's, like, a racist conversation, but
 Where the hell is my damn screwdriver? I'm wiping all the germs off for you. Quit cleaning my damn tools, and sit your ass down! Huh! Shit, dude. We might want to even consider bringing Poppins back into this mix. It does seem to be working.
 Like it?
 Ooh! Yes, I do. Please don't hit me. I have sensitive skin. Let's just find the dog, and we'll talk about it there.
 Okay. All right. Let's just let them be, though, huh? Good morning, sleepyhead.
 What?
 Yeah, you're all tied up. It's for your own safety.
 Yeah, you took a dinger down the stairs.
 Ooh, big-time. You guys untie me right now! Okay, I'll untie you if you promise to remember that I took care of you good. Remember that, 'cause Frank took really good care of you
 So you're gonna have to take care of him.
 What are you talking about? I feel way worse now than I ever did. What is going on with my face?
 It's the bedbugs.
 Oh! But that'll last a little while, but it'll go away eventually. Get that dog off me! The dog stinks!
 Get the dog off me!
 Fair enough, fair enough. Poppins, let's go.
 Come on, dog.
 Hop up, Poppins. Come on. Oh, whoa. Oh, I think Poppins got into the juice.
 What?
 Oh, no.
 What juice?
 Oh. He's ice-cold.
 He's dead? Poppins is dead?
 Yes! He's dead!
 Why would he be dead from the juice?
 We killed Poppins? Oh, shit! Oh, my God. Mac's gonna have a fit, dude. I drank a lot of that juice. I remember that very clearly!
 I have an idea, Frank. Fixer's always got a fix.
 Yeah, what? This is gonna work. This is a good idea. Grab Poppins. Let's go.
 Take the dog?
 Grab the dog! What was in the juice? Okay, hold on. Before you go, untie me.
 You stay right there, Deandra.
 Just real quick, you guys. You guys, I got Groban in the park.
 I got a dead dog over here.
 I got Groban in the park! Untie me! What was in the juice?
 One, two, three.
 One, two, three. Charlie, I think you're right, dude. I feel better about this. More in control. Yeah.
 Yo, what's happening?
 What's happening, guys? Hey, I was just- We were hanging out, uh, in the alley, going for some air.
 What's going on?
 Yeah.
 What are you guys doing?
 Cool. We're actually looking for Poppins. Yeah, we're gonna bring him back over to Charlie's mom's house.
 They're gonna live together.
 Oh, Poppins?
 What happened to Poppins?
 He w- He, uh

 You saw him.
 Yeah, might've been

 Why are you guys acting so weird?
 Yeah. Why are you
 Why are you looking at that trash can? Uh, nothing special about it. I don't know.
 What was in that trash bag?
 Poppins.
 What?
 Well, he ate a lot of cold medicine, and he croaked.
 I'm sorry.
 Yeah, he got into some cold medicine. Sorry. So you threw him in the trash?
 What are you gonna do, send him to the moon?
 Right. I mean, come on. No, I want to have a proper burial for him. That seemed proper enough for Poppins, you know? Oh, no. He's fine.
 What?
 He's fine?
 Yeah, he's just in here chowing down on a diaper.
 Hey! Look at him.
 Look at- That dog was
 Come on. Hey, good boy. That dog just does not die.
 No, he does not.
 Wow.
 Oh, there he goes.
 Ah. Don't worry, guys. He will be back. Yeah, well, let's hope not. Bon voyage, Poppins! Have a good trip.
 Back to the bar, or what?
 Yeah.
 Yeah, sure.
 Let's grab a drink. Yo, Frank, it's Artemis. Have you seen Dee? I'm backstage with Groban, and the party is pumpin '. Look, if you see that "beeyatch," tell her to get her ass down here 'cause Groban's feeling frisky and somebody's gotta tap that ass.
 Oh! Oh, no!
 Suck you later. No! No! Groban! No!                       I'm so pumped, dude. I hope I get to see at least one ancient spirit. I think we should get some chalk and some erasers because that dust cloud, you know, really shows the laser beam alarms.
 So you can see

 Oh! Get a little dust cloud going. We got to spend a lot of time in the Civil War section. No, we're not doing the Civil War section, Frank. We are gonna hit up ancient Egypt though. I'm very excited about that.
 And we're sticking together.
 Just so I'm clear you guys don't actually think that things are going to come alive because you're spending the night in a museum, right? I'm sorry, but we're simply opening ourselves up to the possibility of an amazing adventure this evening. Is there something wrong with that? Now, whether that means Charlie running into his ancient spirits or us having to just, you know, run away from security guards all night
 Either way, it's gonna be a really, really great time. It's certainly gonna be a lot better than sticking around the bar all night watching you eat sandwich after sandwich after sandwich. What the hell is the matter with you? You've been stuffing your face for days. It's fatness, Frank, plain and simple. It's a person becoming fat before your eyes. I don't even really know how to make the bird jokes anymore. Like, they don't apply. I'm not fat. I'm pregnant. I feel like you say that all the time now. You better do yourself a favor and flush it out. Wait a second. You've definitely said that before. You're right. Yeah, and since we're all saying things that we say all the time, I'll just reiterate
 Dee, we don't care about you or your body or your baby or that baby bird that you're probably carrying inside of you.
 Right.
 Oh, really? Well, you should give a shit, 'cause one of you is the father.
 What?
 Wh-What the hell you talking about? I'm talking about the Halloween party, where one of you got me pregnant. But, you know, since you guys don't care about me or my body or my baby or whatever it was that you were saying, we shouldn't talk about it. You guys are on your way to a museum to spend the night. Hey, have a great time, guys. Oh, shit. I mean, what is she even talking about? Got her pregnant at the Halloween party? What does that mean? I don't even remember that party. I was wasted. Yeah, me too. I browned out that evening. "Browned out"? What's "browned out"? Oh, it's when you drink so much that everything goes brown. It's not as severe as a blackout, 'cause I remember bits and pieces. I like to call it "browning out."
 Hmm, never heard of that before.
 There's a good reason for that, Frank because I think Mac just made it up on the spot.
 I did.
 You did. That's a great term.
 "Browning out"?
 You like it?
 I love it.
 Thank you. I'm pretty sure at a certain point we all probably browned out. So I think our best chance at figuring this out is for us to all put our browns together mash them together and try and figure out which one of you two banged my sister. Okay, but let's not overuse the "brown" thing right in the beginning, you know. Yeah, but here's the thing
 Once you throw a term like that out and everybody likes it, it's pretty much fair game.
 We can use it whenever we want.
 It's public domain at that point.
 It becomes public domain.
 Now we're just trying to figure out who banged Dee. That's the important thing. Let's not focus too much on the "brown" thing
 even though it's a term that I'm gonna use a lot. And I'm probably gonna use it a lot right now. So here's what I remember from my brown state. I remember we were all in costume and our costumes were pretty cool, except for yours. I was really pissed off at you, because we agreed to go as Mario and Luigi. I held up my end of the bargain. And then you showed up wearing a different costume at the last minute. Dude, what are you doing? Where's your Mario costume? No, I went with a sexier look. Sexy? Bro, we agreed on funny over sexy this year so we could disarm the ladies. You don't remember this conversation? Without my Mario, what am I? I'm just, like, some weird Italian plumber. I look like an asshole. What is that? What even is that? I'm that character from Lord of the Rings, "Viggio Morgenstein." Okay, that is not the character's name. That's the actor's name. And you're not even getting that right. You're totally, totally boning me here, bro. Do you realize that? Yo, yo, yo! Look at the turnout for our "par-tay." I want to suck your blood! It's Twilight time! Time for blood sucking. Yeah, dude, I'm doing a vampire thing! 'Cause chicks are all into vampires and stuff you know, 'cause of the stupid Twilight movie and all that other crap. You know, so I'm like, what if the waitress is into it? This is my best shot! You are dressed like the Phantom of the Opera. He's not a vampire.
 He eats theater people.
 No, he doesn't.
 I think he might.
 He does. And I'm surprised you even know who the Phantom of the Opera is.
 He might not.
 He doesn't.
 No, I don't. I don't.
 This party blows. There's no studs here. No beef in the freezer, if you know what I mean. Dee, why in God's name would you wear a costume with giant wings?
 I'm a sexy angel.
 Are we supposed to pretend like you're not dressed like a giant bird? I mean, if you're gonna be sexy, don't dress like a bird, Dee.
 I didn't dress like a bird. I'm clearly an angel.
 No. Besides, did you guys see that cooze over there dressing like a peacock? Big, giant bird. Green bird.
 Ooh!
 Ooh! She wears it well. Woof, woof. She wears it very well. She wears it so well, in fact, that I have now pinpointed her as my prey for the evening. Yeah! She will be mine. As a matter of fact, I'm gonna go get that process started right now. Out of my way, bird. This is all sounding right. I remember this. Yeah? This all sounds right to you? Okay, okay. So it was later in the evening, and things had progressed quite a bit 'cause I remember we were all starting to get pretty lit at this point. But, see, I distinctly remember there being some kind of a commotion at the other end of the bar. Hey, leave us alone! Just stop it! Now, this lady, she sounded like she was in a fair amount of distress but I didn't really give a shit, because despite looking like a cartoon bricklayer I was starting to get pretty close to sealing the deal with the peacock lady. Look, dude, you've been bugging me all night, okay? I think your costume's weird, I think you're creepy
 And I just want you to leave me alone.
 Yeah. Yes. Yes.
 Stupid costume is so sexy.
 What? I can't believe it, man. She takes advantage of me. She's like, "Oh, my God, you look so sexy! I'm gonna sex you all up!" I'm like, "You're just my friend! Get your sex off me!" And then she gets all sexy with me, 'cause I've, like, got the sexiest costume in the world on!
 I hate it!
 So what- Did you want to get rid of that costume? Yes, I want to get rid of the costume! You have any idea what it's like to be this sexy?
 Can I have your costume, dude?
 Yeah, you can have it.
 Really? You'll switch costumes with me?
 I didn't even wanna be

 Yeah!
 Let's switch. Let's switch. Come on, let's go switch. You'll be okay, buddy. Yes, dude! It's all coming back to me now. You came over to me. We agreed to switch costumes. You gave me your sexy, sexy costume and I was able to fell the seductive temptress finally. Oh, yeah, so I did have sex with the peacock lady. Yeah, awesome. Ah, that's so awesome, dude. Well, mystery solved. I mean- Awesome!
 That's not the mystery.
 Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That you banged the peacock chick is not the mystery. The Dee thing is the mystery. Right. Dee
 Somebody had sex with Dee, and she got pregnant and- Well, whatever. Okay. Well, clearly, from that story, Charlie, you're the one that banged her. That's why you were feeling so much remorse and regret and you had the tears coming out of your eye. Who wouldn't feel that way after banging
 Ah, shit, dude. Oh, shit. 'Cause the way you're telling that story it definitely sounds like that, 'cause I remember crying! No. Those were tears of joy. Yes, and it wasn't 'cause of Dee, obviously. Okay, I remember this now. I remember this, all right? Frank and Artemis were sitting at the bar and they were in the middle of some kind of big argument. And I was with the McPoyle brothers over at the jukebox and I just finalized a delicate truce with them. So look- So if you guys are cool, then I'm totally cool.
 We're cool as cucumbers.
 Bump it. This time I will bump it. The truce is on! We bumped fists, and Dee walked by.
 Oh, hey, Dee.
 Hey, Charlie. Great costume. Yeah, you too. Thanks. Like the feathers. And just then the waitress came in. Hey, I see you received my invitation. Yeah, Charlie, I received all 100 of them. Who's this jerk? This is my new boyfriend. He's here to protect me. Oh, wait. This is the guy you were telling me about.
 Hey.
 Hey.
 The lady's taken.
 Get out of my face, bro.
 Oh, really?
 Yeah, really.
 You want to get your ass kicked?
 Okay, leave us alone.
 I have to defend your honor!
 Please stop it! Mac, get my back. Oh, goddamn it! I got milk all over me! That was insanely masculine. I made out with the waitress! That's amazing, man! I got to call her or- I'm out of here.
 Charlie, didn't happen.
 What? What?
 No?
 That's not the way it happened.
 No?
 No. You got parts of it right but you're leaving out some major things. Let me set the damn record straight. First of all, don't say I went as Spider-Man. I didn't go as Spider-Man. I was Man-Spider. Totally different! Yes, I was having an argument with Artemis because a couple weeks before, we had some makeup sex in a Dumpster out in the back of Wendy's. Yeah! Yeah! She incorporated a bun in the lovemaking. She took the- the dough and rolled it up into a ball, and then she
 We were going berserk. She loves that kind of stuff. And I-I admit I do too. Frank- Frank, we don't need to hear this part of the story, okay? Can you just tell us about Halloween? Stick to Halloween night. Okay. We were arguing because she wanted another Dumpster hump, and I wanted to stay at the party. So I walked away. That's when you were doing your thing.
 I'm gonna kick your ass, bro!
 Leave us alone!
 I have to defend your honor!
 Please stop!
 Mac, get my back, dude!
 I'm here, buddy! Goddamn it! I got milk all over me! You are insane! Insanely masculine. It was Artemis that took advantage of you because she was trying to make me jealous. After you broke free you wandered off muttering something about the costume being too sexy. Not from you! It's the stupid sexy costume! Ah, shit. Somebody please tell me Frank's memory is not correct. Knock, knock, dick-faces.
 Hi.
 Artie, thanks for coming so quick. Listen, we're trying to piece together a night, and we need some guidance. I don't remember that night. I didn't tell you which night yet. I don't remember most evenings. You can try me, but I will not promise you anything.
 Last Halloween.
 Oh, Halloween.
 Anything ring a bell?
 That was quite a night. I suppose I do recall a few bits and pieces.
 What happened?
 Spill. Well, I was angry at you because of an incident that happened a few weeks before where you and I were in the Dumpster behind Wendy's.
 I incorporated a hamburger bun in a way that he found very
 This is not the part that- Why does everybody think we wanna know about that? Because it's really interesting and innovative, and I thought maybe you'd want some lessons.
 Did you make out with me?
 I sure did. And it worked like a charm. I had Frank all to myself for a month straight after that. All right, let's get back to Halloween. Anything else that happened that night
 like Deandra getting pregnant? Oh, well, that makes sense. Mac slept with her at the party. What? What are you talking about? I'm talking about the sounds of hot, passionate lovemaking that was coming from the bathroom that I had heard with my own two ear-balls. After the fight and the kiss Mac had blood all over his knuckles and went to the bathroom to wash it off. Dee was incensed that her costume was covered in milk.
 So she went to the bathroom to clean herself up. But the line for the ladies ' room was too long so she went to the men's room. Frank started to apologize to me, and after a few minutes we decided to have makeup sex in the men's room. But the door was locked, and I heard the passionate, unmistakable sounds of lovemaking coming from inside. Mac was making love to Sweet Dee in the bathroom so Frank and I had to sneak outside to my station wagon where we gave each other hand jobs. Well, there you have it. Mac's the dad.
 Mac's the dad! Chant with me.
 No

 Mac's the dad! Let's go! Mac

 No, I'm not the
 I'm not the dad, okay, Charlie? Just trust me on that. Hey, all the evidence is pointing towards you, pal. Yes, there were passionate sounds of lovemaking coming from the bathroom, but it wasn't me and Dee. Damn it. I was hoping I wouldn't have to admit this, but I guess I have to tell you. Okay, here goes. I was in the back of the bar when the commotion began and I heard Charlie cry out for help. He was about to get his ass kicked by that giant dude. Mac, help me, please! I need you!
 There was no time for an ocular pat-down.
 Not in my bar, bro. I secured the area, and I retained order- like I always do. Everybody chill. It's cool now. I had a tremendous amount of douche bag blood all over my knuckles so I went to the bathroom to clean it off.
 That's when Dee came in.
 Oh, hey, Dee. Look, I do not give a shit about your problems, Dee, okay? I'm still pumped up from that ass-whooping I just handed out. Did you see that? I don't give a shit, Dee, okay?
 I don't know how you're gonna get all that milk off of you. What is that supposed to mean? Okay, you know what? Shoo. Shoo. Get out of here. Shoo. Shoo! Get out of here. Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Come on! Get out! Get out! So annoying. Whoa! Margaret, what are you doing here? God, that is so gross. You're always doing that. Are you trying to tell me something? Is that, like, a sexual thing? All right. Let's do this. Hold on a second. So are you telling us that you had sex with Margaret McPoyle that night? Yes. Ooh.
 Yeah.
 Well, you know we got to go confront the McPoyles about this now. Yeah, we got to confirm this whole story. The only consistent part about every single one of these stories is that the McPoyles were there, and they were drinking milk which means they were stone-cold sober that night. They could probably confirm the truth. Ah, shit. Last Halloween. Hmm. And Dee's pregnant, huh? Hmm. I remember that night well. As do I. Quite well. You were all very, very, very drunk.
 Quite drunk.
 You should feel shame. Okay, don't give us your judgments, all right?
 Can you please just tell us what you remember?
 Tell us what happened. Well, we just finished accepting Charles's terrible, terrible truce. That's, like, the whole truce. You know, that's all there is to it. And if you guys are cool with it, then I'll be perfectly cool with it.
 Whatever.
 Just get out of our face. Your breath is awful.
 Oh, really?
 Yeah. All right, well, bump it? What about this one? You bump? That's cool. Cool, guys. Good truce, good truce, good truce, good truce.
 Ah, hey, Dee.
 Shut up. Yep. Yep. Uh, hello, hello, hello, hello! I see you received my invitation. I'm sorry. Do I know you?
 Who's this jerk?
 Uh, this is my boyfriend.
 What the hell?
 Whoa. Time out, buddy. What's going on here? The lady's taken, buddy!
 Yeah, I know she is!
 Who are you?
 You want to get your ass kicked?
 Leave us alone! I have to defend your honor! Mac, get my back! Goddamn it! I got milk all over me! Viggio Morgenstein! Hey. I'm insanely high on mescaline. Are you telling me that wasn't even the waitress? Not at all. After the fight, Mac went to the bathroom to wash that poor girl's blood off his hands. And Dee followed. They were only in there a short moment together before Dee came back out. Mac kicked her out of the bathroom so he could make sweet love to Margaret in private. I heard you gave quite a performance, Macwell. Mmm. Mmm!
 Mmm!
 Oh! Okay, that's enough, all right? God, that's your sister.
 Uh

 Yeah. You know what? Just move past it. Tell the story, please. She's still expecting a call. Okay. That's not gonna happen, so just move past it, all right? You will call her! Jesus, man, I'm sorry. Fine, I'll call her. As I was saying Dee came out of the bathroom in quite a rage. Stupid costume. Everybody calling me a bird. She accosted the girl you were all ogling that evening. Hey, you, everybody thinks you're so hot, huh? You big hot bird. Well, I tell you what. You take it off and switch with me.
 What are you talking about?
 Me, mine
 This is mine now. Switch it.
 Uh, I don't think so.
 "Oh, I don't think so." I didn't ask you, okay? Listen. All right, number one, it's a win-win for both of us. That weird plumber- he's gonna leave you alone for the rest of the night. That's good, right? And then the second great thing for you is I'm not gonna beat the shit out of you, so let's go. Dee came out of the bathroom in her new costume feeling quite saucy. Call me a bird all night. Making fun, saying names. Well, let's see who's sexy now, dickwads. 'Cause I look good. Dee was clearly on a warpath to prove to one of you that she was indeed sexy. And the best way to do that was to trick one of you two into making love to her. Knowing that Charlie was the weakest and by far the most vulnerable she assumed he would be the easiest to take advantage of. And so she took Charlie into the back office and had her way with him. You should see the look on your face. It's good enough to eat. No. Hold on a second. That wasn't me.
 What?
 That wasn't me. I switched costumes with Dennis. That was Dennis. So Dennis thought Deandra was the peacock chick. And Dee thought that Dennis was Charlie? So Dee thinks that I'm the dad, but, Dennis, you're the dad! Delightful. Oh, shit. I'm gonna be sick. Go. Do it. Feel it. Let it out. Let's just get out- Let's just get out of here. Don't flush.
 Dee!
 Deandra! Dee! Dee!
 Deandra!
 Yeah! This is bad! This is real bad! You thought you had sex with Charlie but it was Dennis that you went into the back room with. See? I had sex with you. It was sex with me. It was sex with me. He threw up the whole way over here, Dee. Dennis is the father of that baby. We got to get you and that monster that's in your gut down to Mexico A.S.A.P! Are you kidding me? I did not have sex with Dennis. Yes, you did! Yeah- All right, look, look. You went in the back office with him, not me. You thought it was me 'cause you wanted sex from me! But you got sex from Dennis! Okay, you're saying that because I went into the back office alone with Dennis that I must have had sex with him? Gross! No! That did not happen. Have you guys been obsessing about this all night long?
 Yes!
 Yeah? Of course. We were running around trying to figure out who the father is. If it's not Dennis, who is it?
 It's none of you.
 Huh? No, none of you are the father. I just told you that 'cause you were making fun of me for eating the sandwich and I thought it would upset you and get you going, and it did, it worked. You guys have been obsessing about this all night. So, wait
 Are-Are you absolutely sure that you and I did not have sex and that that's not my
 Uh, yeah. Oh!
 Whoa! Ho, ho!
 Whoo! Yeah, but I'll tell you what. I'm not gonna tell you who the father is.
 Who gives a shit?
 Yeah. You all give a shit. You just said so. You were up all night. You were thinking about it all night long. Yeah, but that was before, when you said it was one of us.
 Now that it's not one of us, I mean

 Who cares?
 Who cares, right?
 It's no big deal.
 Yeah, we don't care.
 All right. Oh, my God. I got to take a- Oh, Jesus.
 Whoo, ooh!
 Whoa, baby! Whoo!
 This close, baby.
 That is a load off my shoulders, man.
 I really dodged a bullet on that one.
 You did, man.
 Well, we all did. We all did.
 Hey, what about the museum?
 Huh?
 Yes!
 We could do it.
 Boom. There's still time! Dee, we're out of here!
 You look like a turkey!
 Yeah.
 I would say- I would say, you look like an ostrich!
 Yes!
 Right?
 That's pretty good. You know, I want to call her an emu
 But I want to save it for, you know

 Save it, save it, save it. You are a big, fat, flightless bird!
 Yeah, yeah!
 Those are all

 Those are all

 Yeah, I mean

 Just sort of the general

 The general whatever.                     # Butt, butt, butt # # Open up the time capsule #
 # Butt, butt, butt Time capsule, time capsule #
 What are you doing?
 # Butt, butt, butt #
 That's great, Charlie. I could watch him do that for hours.
 # Time capsule #
 # Butt, butt # What is the time capsule butt, butt? We're about to open this time capsule that we buried 10 years ago.
 Oh.
 Yeah.
 What'd you put in there?
 Oh, man. We just put a bunch of stuff in here that we thought would be valuable one day. Like, uh, let's see
 We got a Gregg Jefferies baseball card.
 Future All-Star. Future All-Star.
 Uh, we got a Korn CD. Uh, we got a copy of Cider House Rules on laser disc.
 Don't know why we thought that would be valuable.
 That's a collector's item.
 That's gonna be very- Be very careful with that.
 Oh, my God, you guys.
 This is a letter to my future self.
 What? Yeah. "Dear Future Dee, how's Hollywood? Congrats on all of your success. Stay grounded. Enclosed is a check for one million dollars. Be sure to give it to Dr. Larry Meyers as a thank-you for all of his inspiration." That's stupid. This is just stupid.
 Who's Dr. Larry Meyers?
 Nobody. It doesn't matter. He was my high school drama teacher. This is just dumb. Like, why would we put such stupid stuff in here? And also, we buried it and then we opened it 10 years later? What, are you supposed to just bury it, open it right up and not give yourself any time to fulfill any kind of dreams? The whole thing's dumb. Like- Cider House Rules? Okay. Hormones.
 Wow.
 She's all worked up.
 It's the failure.
 It's the failure. It's sad. It's sad.
 What else is in there?
 Uh- Oh! Old pictures!
 Pictures! Holy shit.
 Look at that!
 Look!
 "The gang." Whew. Who's this jag-off? Look.
 Oh, that's Schmitty!
 Schmitty! He was the fourth member of our crew.
 There was another member of the gang?
 Oh, yeah, dude.
 I miss him. Why did we ditch him in the first place?
 I don't know. Eh, he wasn't a good fit. Remember? You know? Kind of got on our nerves.
 He didn't get on my nerves.
 No, he never got on my nerves. I actually really loved that guy. You know what?
 I remember now. Charlie soured on him.
 No. And then he, like, gave us an ultimatum. You remember? And then we all turned on the guy pretty quickly. I mean, we all agreed he was out of the
 You pushed him out of a moving car and yelled, "You're out of the gang!" Now, in hindsight that does seem a little rash. Yeah, it was a bit of a snap decision. Why don't you call this Schmitty guy up and see what he's up to now? You know, I do feel like we owe the guy an apology.
 Yeah. You know what? I'd love to see Schmitty.
 I would too. Yeah, but that's a bad snap decision, you know?
 There's a reason he didn't work out.
 Let's go. We got a good thing going on now without him. We don't need a new member of the gang.
 Don't get Schmitty. Don't get Schmitty.
 I like Schmitty. He's nice.
 I'm really pumped to meet this guy.
 Ah, he was the coolest. Seriously.
 Oh, hey. Hey!
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Mrs. Schmit. Hey, it's, uh- it's Dennis. Yeah, and Mac. You remember us, right? We're looking for Schmitty. He around? Ah, he's dead.
 Oh.
 What? Oh, gosh. That is too bad.
 We're sorry for your loss.
 Yee-aaah! What's up, bitches?
 Oh!
 Is that Schmitty?
 Yeah, it's Schmitty!
 We thought you were dead.
 He made me say it.
 "He made me say it. " Listen to you, Mom. Thank you for playing along. You're a sweetheart. You see that shit? He jumped down a whole flight of stairs. Yeah, I didn't see you down there, Chuckles. How you been, little man? Not that little, you know? Regular size.
 Maybe he, but

 Not anymore.
 Put on a few LB's since I saw you last, huh?
 Nope!
 Same weight. Same weight I always been.
 He put on a lot of weight.
 No, you tacked on weight.
 I tacked on mass. Muscle mass. Who's this old son of a bitch?
 I'm Frank.
 Frank?
 Frank.
 I'm Schmitty. Nice to- Put her there.
 No!
 Don't kiss him! Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, uh, so what brings you dicks here, huh? Oh, well, Schmitty, um, honestly, we came around here because we, um

 Go ahead.
 Want to say we're sorry, Schmitty that- that we

 Can you take this, Mac?
 Yeah, man, I got this. We just want to say we're sorry for icing you out in the past, and we'd like your forgiveness.
 Yeah.
 Get on your knees and ask.
 Excuse me?
 Get down on your knees and ask. Show some humility, for Christ's sake.
 Really?
 Yeah.
 Aw, man.
 Whatever it takes, Schmitty.
 Wow, you're really doing it. I'm kidding. I'm kidding!
 Oh! Oh, he's joking! Oh, man! Come on, guys! Have some dignity, some respect for yourselves.
 Do you forgive us?
 Absolutely. That's classy, Schmitty. Very classy. Dr. Meyers?
 Yes?
 Hi. Dee Reynolds. I was in the school musical. Frankenstein. Yes, of course! Deandra Reynolds!
 Yeah!
 Sit, darling.
 Thank you.
 Sit. Listen, I came to talk to you about high school. I
 Oh, uh
 I was drinking a lot back then, so if I did anything inappropriate
 Oh, no, no, no. No, not at all. In fact, the opposite. You were, like, the most inspiring teacher I had. In fact, I wrote you this check 10 years ago with the hopes that I could one day give it to you as a thank-you. May you rot in hell, you wretched beast! Oh. Um
 I'm confused. Uh
 Frankenstein. That's what the villagers screamed at you just before you threw yourself on the funeral pyre. Oh, you were such a hideous delight in that show. Thank you. Yes, okay. So what you're saying is, don't give up. I shouldn't give up on my dream of being
 No, my dear. You must give up. You must. It's far too late for you. But it's not too late to teach. Come speak to the kids. Inspire them. It's an opportunity to share your unique experiences.
 Uh-huh.
 The question is: Will you seize it? Mmm. No, thank you.
 Five, four, three
 What? No, I just never wanted to be

 Two, one.
 Teaching doesn't
 No offense. What are you doing?
 Okay, yes.
 And there you have it! A teacher is born. There we are. Man, this is unbelievable. Working at a bar? Running a bar? This has got to be, like, the greatest job ever, right?
 It is, man. This is what we do.
 A lot of dicking around. Hey, um, you're still, uh, living with your mom, huh? That sounds kind of lame. Yeah, well, I mean, it's the M.S. that's really lame.
 You know?
 Oh, your mom has
 Yeah, yeah. Yeah. She's doing all right though. I moved in with her to take care of her and stuff like that. It's good to really get to know her before, you know, uh, she moves on. Kind of a downer, that story though. Kind of a downer. What about you, man? What's your living situation like these days?
 Oh, it's pretty sweet.
 I am. I'm his living situation.
 He lives with me.
 Oh, yeah?
 Yeah, we share a bed.
 Well, not every night. That's hilarious. Charlie and I used to be roomies.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, yeah. You remember that?
 Oh, yeah.
 Hey, you remember how you used to try to get me to play all those lame games? You know, those weird things you would want to do at night? Like, uh, Night Crawlers?
 We play Night Crawlers all the time.
 You do?
 Well, Frank enjoys those games very much.
 Oh. Oh. Correct me if I'm wrong, but to make Night Crawlers a little bit better you should use blankets, right?
 They could be the dirt!
 Exactly. You could use it as a force field or as a roaming base.
 It's a great idea.
 It's not a good idea though because it's an imagination-based game. No, it's still imagination-based. Oh! I had an idea! Dennis, remember you and Mac and you guys were laughing at me doing the butt dance? They love that when I do it. Guys, watch me. Watch me, will you? Oh, yeah! Five, six, seven, eight! # Butt, butt #
 # Butt, butt #
 Oh, Charlie, no. # Give it to me G- #
 Where is this coming fr- This is not

 This is embarrassing. God, this is just humiliating. Guys, get excited! We're doing the
 # Butt, butt # Hey, Charlie, you're not having fun doing it, so we're not having fun watching it, buddy. Watch. It's like this. It's more
 I don't know. Something like, uh
 # Butt, butt, butt-butt-butt #
 # Butt, butt, butt-butt-butt Butt, butt, butt-butt-butt # Butt butt! Woo, woo, woo, woo! Hyah! Butt dance 2.0. Butt dance 2.0.
 I'll drink to that.
 You know what you got that Charlie doesn't quite have? You have that "it" factor. You know what I'm saying? Charisma. It's, like, you got it. Hey, you guys! Can I talk to you in the back office for a second real quick? I can't believe this dude. He has not changed in years, man! Look, you guys need to make a decision right now, okay? It is either him, or it is me!
 Him.
 Yeah. I was gonna say him too. Yeah, him, him. It's always been him. I don't know why I didn't see that before. I'm out of the gang?
 Him.
 Him. Hello, everybody. Hi there. My name is Dee Reynolds, and not only am I a professional actress and comedienne uh, but I also used to go to school here. What have you acted in? A lot of- A lot. I've acted in a lot of things. Y- You may not have seen all of them or any of them. It's not time for questions. I'll let you know when it's time for questions though, okay? And the phone goes away. And the phone goes into your pocket or into your backpack. But not out in your fingers, because I'm talking.
 Nah, I'm a'ight.
 Yeah. Said the turkey. Uh-oh. Oh, no. Who's she? Who's she? She's somebody that'll zing you back. Right? I'll zing you. I'll zap you, I'll zing you. So just know that about me. You know, I know that, uh, you guys are 18 and you're seniors, and so
 Okay, what is it that they're doing? What is this that they're doing?
 Oh, they're doing their coughing thing.
 Yeah, I hear that. All right, kids, settle down. You can, uh, read, pull out your phones, whatever. They do love their phones. What? That's it? You're just gonna sit in the corner and hem away at your sock all day? No! Where
 Where is the teacher that I knew? Where is that inspirational man? My enthusiasm in those days was fueled entirely by the alcohol. Dee! Hey!
 Come here. Come here.
 Charlie, what are you- what are you doing? Got kicked out of the gang. What are you up to? You wanna hang out? No, Charlie. I don't want to hang out. I-I have a job. I'm a teacher now, so I got to get back to inspiring some students. Oh, that's pretty sweet. You want to toss some inspiration my way? 'Cause the guys think Schmitty's all that and, like, I'm no good.
 Okay, Charlie, how about this?
 Uh-huh?
 You are good at cleaning shit out of toilets
 Right. and taking trash and throwing it into Dumpsters. So why don't you get a new job somewhere else doing those kinds of things and make friends there, okay? Okay, Dee, so are you saying get a job here as the janitor and then you and I can be best friends? That is absolutely not what I was saying.
 I'm gonna talk to the principal, see if I can get that job.
 Don't do that.
 We'll work on the friendship thing later.
 No, don't do that. Charlie, don't do that. Oh, goddamn it, don't do that. This is my thing. Here we go.
 All right! There's the man!
 What's up, buddy?
 This place is pretty nice.
 Yeah. What's going on? Are you guys gonna try to bang me afterwards or something?
 Very nice turn.
 Try not to laugh too much, 'cause it's gonna

 We only come here for special occasions.
 Yeah. Good, good. What's the occasion? Well, we brought you to this luncheon, Schmitty because we want to make this official.
 Mac, do you have the ring?
 Yeah. Okay, great. Um
 Schmitty, we, uh
 we missed a lot of good, good years.
 A lot of special time.
 Yeah?
 With- With you.
 Thanks. And, uh

 You know what? I don't think I can do this.
 Okay. I'll take over from here.
 I'll take over.
 Why's he being a big-time puss?
 I know. He's emotional.
 Schmitty we want you back, if you'll have us. What the hell is this shit? It's a sterling silver clover ring. When we put all four of them together, it makes a four-leaf clover solidifying our bond for all time. You're kidding though, right?
 No, we've never been more serious in our lives.
 Yeah. Yeah, whatever. I don't care. Sure.
 Yes? Yes? That's a yes!
 Yeah. He said yes. That's a yes.
 We bagged him.
 We certainly did. Oh, food's here! Food is here. Wait. Hold on. No, I didn't order yet. Oh, that's okay. I took care of the food already. Yes. Dennis orders for us. That is a humongous shrimp. Well, it's 'cause it's not a shrimp, Frank. It's a prawn.
 And I don't like prawns, so I eat around them.
 Yeah. I'll take your prawns if you want to take my salad.
 Eh.
 No?
 Okay. Yeah. That's what I'll do.
 Hey, no, wait! Hold on! Why don't you just order what you want? Well, Dennis kind of has the best palate. Yeah, I have the most refined palate, Schmitty. That's how we do things now. You've been away for a while. It's fine. No, no. That's not what I'm gonna do. Excuse me. Hey, come here really quick. Um, can I get, uh
 You have linguine? Yeah, can I get linguine instead?
 Uh And what do you guys want? Order whatever you want.
 Linguine's too heavy for lunch.
 No, no. What do you want?
 I want fries.
 Fries for this guy.
 No, no, no.
 I can have fries?
 You don't like your salad all of a sudden, Mac?
 I hate salad.
 You hate salad? Where is this coming from?
 I didn't wanna say anything.
 I hate this restaurant.
 Yeah, this restaurant blows.
 I'll have a ginger ale.
 All right! Come on, man! Get into it!
 I'm saying that now. Can I say that now?
 What?
 Hyah!
 Absolutely. Take it. That's yours. By all means.
 All right.
 What'd you get, a ginger ale? I'm a little confused. Are you telling me that this photo of Bruce Jenner is your résumé? Well, when I showed up this morning I didn't have a formal résumé on me so I was sort of hoping the photograph of Mr. Jenner could
 could represent the standard of excellence I'm hoping to bring to this position. I see. And you're looking for a job as a substitute teacher? Substitute janitor. Look I'll clean this building so good, you're not gonna know what to do with yourself. You know what I mean? I'm not a proud man. I'll do the jobs that the other guys don't want to do. I'll degrade myself. I'll make a genuine ass out of myself. Yeah. Hey, look, I'll swallow that eraser whole just to prove it to you. Uh, no, no. Please. Please. No.
 I'll swallow it whole.
 Oh, no, no, no, no. You don't have to do that. But I have to say, I don't think I've ever encountered someone who's so passionate about joining our custodial staff. The passion I have for the work that I do is extraordinary. It probably goes beyond Jenner.
 Uh-huh.
 And I'm serious. I'll eat that eraser whole. Oh, no, no, it's not nec- You don't need to eat the eraser to prove your point.
 Sure.
 Uh, you have the job.
 Are you serious?
 I love your attitude. It's fantastic. Sir, I am not gonna let you down. I'm gonna start cleaning immediately.
 Immediately.
 Okay. Uh, but first, can I eat the eraser? Are you- You're saying you want to eat the eraser? Well, I'm asking if it's edible, because it certainly smells of grapes.
 I don't think it's edible.
 Can't I just test it? I'd rather you didn't. I kinda want- I might need it. All right. Well, you win this one. I'll pick up one of my own and I'll eat that one. That way everybody wins. All right, well, welcome aboard. All right. All right. Thanks so much. Ridiculous. It's ridiculous. Where the hell is he?
 I don't know.
 What time did we say?
 We said 3:00.
 We said 3:00, and it's, like

 Ah.
 Hyah!
 Well

 What's crappenin', fellas?
 Uh, hey, Schmitty. Running kinda late there, huh?
 Am I?
 I didn't think it mattered.
 How could it not matter? This is the final phase of your initiation back into the gang, so it kinda matters a lot.
 It actually does.
 Whoa. Um, where is your ring? Oh, come on. You didn't want me to really wear that thing, did ya? Yeah.
 Oh.
 We're sort of sticklers for that kind of thing too.
 So pop that on.
 I will. Okay. Sorry about that. Time and ring. Good. Got it.
 Okay. Oh!
 Yeah. Hey, look at this! Nice setup, fellas. Candles? Where'd you steal these from, huh? We bought those. Uh-oh! When the hell'd you take that?
 Don't worry about it, Schmitty.
 We got to ya. This is weird as hell. You guys see that, right? What's weird about this? This is a men's ceremony, okay?
 They have ceremonies for all sorts of men's clubs.
 Yeah. You know, the Mafia, the Freemasons, the White House.
 The White House. They do it.
 This is cool, okay? Trust me. What we're doing is very cool.
 Okay.
 Mac, why don't we get started? You'll get it. He'll understand as the ceremony progresses. All right, Schmitty, please have a seat in the ceremonial seat.
 I'll do the candles.
 Frank, please do the candles. Dennis, the song. All right, the song. Oh, look at that!
 All right, take it- take it seriously.
 I am. I'm locked in. Okay, I will now begin the ceremony by administering a sweet roundhouse kick to the bell. There's a bell? Step, step.
 Uh-oh. Whiff!
 I just missed that. I just missed that.
 Dude, you're not even close.
 No, Schmitty, this is all part of the ceremony. What is? Watch it. Oh! No, no. No.
 Oh, you gotta stretch before this thing, huh?
 Enjoy it. One last crack. Come on.
 Hyah!
 Oh, man. This is pathetic. Here, dude, look. It goes something like this. Hyah! I'm excited. I am. I mean, the first part of the ceremony was a little lame but ending it with a hot air balloon ride, that kicks ass. Yeah, yeah, all those things. Yup. Frank, now! Push, Frank, push! Go, go, go!
 I got him.
 Oh, come on. Come on, Frank, push him out! Are you literally trying to push me out of a moving car again?
 Yes.
 Goddamn it. Pull over. Why are you doing this?
 I'll just pull over. Great job, Frank.
 Frank, come on.
 Tub of lard over here.
 Take it easy, okay?
 Give me back the ring! 'Cause you don't deserve it!
 Take the ring.
 You're out of the gang, Schmitty!
 You're out of the gang! Get out!
 You're out! You're out!
 Okay. Got it. I heard ya. Nice seeing you guys again.
 Very nice meeting you.
 Get out of the car! I heard you. I'm getting out. Okay?
 Now, Dennis. Peel out.
 Yeah
 I was gonna peel out, and then you
 Don't take the steam out of it. Tell people we pushed you! All right, class, feel free to text or watch movies, whatever it is you do.
 Not today, Doc.
 What are you doing, Dee? I am inspiring you. Rise and shine, dickwad. Okay, this is a great teacher but he is wasted on you. Well, not anymore. We're gonna be rehearsing a little musical today called Frankenstein.
 This is stupid.
 Get out. You're stupid.
 What?
 You heard me. Get out of here, you stupid idiot.
 It's fine by me.
 Yeah, good. And anybody else who doesn't want to be here today, you can get out now too.
 Hey, you want to go to the mall?
 No, no, wait. Stop! No, come on, you guys! That's
 Not everybody. Sit back down. That's just something people say. You guys are gonna love this. Okay, let's get started. "Have you seen Dr. Frankenstein's creation that they all speak of?" "Nay, I've heard tales told of his hideousness. A monster most foul." # My face composed of rotten flesh # # Roar, roar # # A hideous beast with deadly clutch # # Roar, roar # # Another's heart beats in my chest # # I'll never know a woman's touch # Roar! And then I retreat into the mist. And, Dr. Meyers, you are Dr. Frankenstein, so get up here and get acting! With pleasure, Dee! Just let me set the loop and here I come! Oops! That's not
 I am shattered to pieces! Are you acting right now? No, I'm not acting, you bitch!
 I think I've broke my hip.
 Oh. Why is this damn stage so slippery?
 Hey, Charlie!
 Hey, there he is! Charlie boy! This floor is slippery, man. Whole school's slippery, 'cause I waxed it real good with this awesome power waxer that the school provided me. I did this whole place in, like, two hours.
 Oh, nice.
 Whoa. That's impressive. Yeah. Dee inspired me. She said, "You're an awesome janitor, Charlie. You can make this whole school slippery." I said, "Sure, I'll give it my best shot." Then she's, like, "Let's be best friends." And I was, like, "Sure, I'll give that my best shot too. " So we're best friends now. Yeah, that's- that's quite a conversation you had with her, isn't it? Mm-hmm. What do you guys want? Oh, well, we, uh- we came to ya because we wanted to tell you that we're sorry for picking Schmitty over you and we feel like we made a big mistake and we want you back, buddy. And, uh
 We pushed him out of a moving car for you.
 I can't do it.
 Jesus, dude. What is wrong with you? All right, I'll handle it. Charlie, we have an announcement to make. It's your lucky day. We want you back.
 Yeah.
 Yeah. Gotta say, that's pretty classy, guys but I wish you gave me one of these a long time ago 'cause I'm a janitor now.                     Here comes my main man, Matty! Time for a haircut, Matty, though. Don't make me give it to ya.
 You the man, Professor.
 You're the man if you stay in school, J.J!
 All right.
 All right, you. Lisa, how's the G.P.A.? Keep it up, up, up, up, up! Professor! Hey, there's my man. Oh, time-out, son! Hang on, son. Uh, did you forget something here?
 Sorry?
 This orange- it belong to you?
 Uh, no.
 Looks pretty good. Not too peeled. Pretty intact here. You want it? No, thanks. I'm cool, Professor. You're cool? Well, when you're cool, you're cool. Well, hey! Dee, how's it going? Teacher's lounge. Pretty sweet. How'd you swing that? I'm a teacher now, Charlie. I'm subbing for Dr. Myers while he gets his hip fixed. Look at us with our new careers, huh? How 'bout that? Yours is kinda the same, you know, 'cause you've always sort of been a janitor.
 Nah, but I'm thriving here, I'll tell you what.
 Uh-huh. Yeah.
 Did you get that orange out of the garbage?
 I sure did. Can you believe that? Someone threw this away. Perfectly good orange, you know? They were digging at it a little bit, and must've given up, but

 Don't eat trash, Charlie.
 I'll eat what I want to eat, okay?
 Miss Reynolds, please report to the front office immediately. You have an emergency call.
 Miss Reynolds, to the front office, please.
 Emergency? Come on. Jump on that.
 Hello?
 Yeah. Hey, Dee. It's Dennis, Mac and Frank.
 Hey, what's the matter?
 I've only just heard. I've only just heard. Your belly's so fat, you make John Candy look like Lara Flynn Boyle.
 Snap!
 What? We've been on a snap-joke kick about your pregnant body but since you're not around, we decided to call you. I don't know. He's talking about a Lara Flynn Boyle joke. I think we got some better ones.
 I have another one.
 Goddamn it, you guys! I am a teacher now, okay? Don't ever call me here again! I don't have time for your shit, you dumbass dickbags! Wrong number. Sorry. Okay. Good morning, everybody. Hi. Good morning. Uh, as you are all aware, Dr. Myers recently broke his hip and, unfortunately, I've been given some devastating news that he's taken a turn for the worse and he's died. Now, while we all feel robbed of him here on Earth heaven above has just received another angel. And that is what you call a monologue! You guys, you're all gonna be doing your own monologues in this class. Now, they're not gonna be as good as mine just was, but listen
 I don't want you to beat yourselves up for

 Okay, okay. I'm confused. So, Dr. Myers isn't dead? No, no. No, not dead. Very much alive. But that's the power of acting. Do you see what I'm saying? One minute dead, the next minute alive- resurrection. It's all acting! Everywhere there's acting. Let's talk about you guys. Why don't you tell me, uh, what your favorite play is. Raise your hand if you've ever seen live theater. Seriously? Are you kidding me? All right. That's it. I am taking you guys on a field trip to Broadway! I'm taking you to New York City.
 Whoa! Yeah!
 Yes! Yes!
 Yeah!
 They've got really good Chinese food. Hey, fat bitch, how you doing today, Richard?
 He's a happy clown.
 Hey, hey, hey! Break it up! Break it up! Aw, come on. Which one of you guys did this? Who painted your face, kid?
 I did.
 He's a dumbass Juggalo.
 Juggalos for life, bitch!
 Watch what you say, Richard. Hey, hey! You watch what you say! All right. You know what? I want the three of you out of the bathroom. I'm talking to the clown. Let's go. And I got my eyes on you guys for the rest of the year. Yeah, I've sized you up. I've stripped you down. I don't like what I see. I'm not impressed. Big tough guys, huh? Big tough guys!
 Yeah.
 Kid, what's going on with the clown makeup, though?
 You're sticking out like a sore thumb.
 That's 'cause I'm a Juggalo. I.C.P.!. Insane Clown Posse, yo. I don't know what that
 You have a posse? Well, good. Stick with your insane clown people, and you won't get jumped. They're a band, dude. I'm, like, a die-hard fan. We're called Juggalos. Where are your real friends, dude? I lost all my friends. Aw, shit, man. I lost all my friends too. All right. I'll tell you what. You know what? If you want to wear your clown makeup in school, wear it. I got your back. You won't get jumped. Yeah, I ain't exactly allowed to wear my makeup in school, though.
 Oh, really?
 Bunch of bullshit, dawg! That is bullshit! All right, kid, today's your lucky day, all right? We're gonna talk to the principal, okay? 'Cause the professor just took an interest in ya! I'm bored to tears. Let's go harass Charlie and Dee. We don't need Charlie and Dee to have fun, okay? We can figure out something to do without them. You know, guys? Now might be a good time to do our Lethal Weapon 5 reshoots. Why would we do reshoots on that? That movie was perfect. Yeah, I was great in it, and my villain was very evil. No, you did a great job, Frank. I'm not talking about that. Your villain was amazing.
 I'm referring more to the blackface of it all.
 What's wrong with the blackface? Well, I seriously regret switching parts with you halfway through and letting you play Murtaugh in blackface. I feel like it was in very poor taste in retrospect. I think it was in poor taste that you were doing Murtaugh in whiteface. I mean, for God's sakes, Dennis, what message does that send? A lot of great actors have done blackface. Oh, you know, there's countless examples of very classy actors doing blackface. Let's see, we've got the great C. Thomas Howell in Soul Man. We've got the Wayans brothers in White Chicks. That was a very tasteful example of reverse blackface. Okay, those are bad examples, okay? There's tons of good examples of old movies with- Frank, help me out. Laurence Olivier in Othello.
 Laurence Olivier in Othello, dude.
 Perfect.
 That's the classiest actor of all time.
 Perfect. Yeah, but I guarantee you there was some black people that were working on that movie that were, like, "Man, what dat white man doing? Dat ain't right. Get a black man."
 Okay, so hold on.
 What kind of voice is that? You're doing a black voice, and that's not racist? I'm just saying that's how black people talk. That's not racist. So you would do a black guy with a black voice but not a black guy with a black face? I don't have a problem at all with doing a black voice.
 That's just an accurate portrayal.
 I don't understand that. I'm just saying it's just about doing it tastefully, okay? Yeah, and you got to make the lips funny.
 Oh, no!
 No, no, no. What?
 They have to be funny. The lips have to be outlined.
 It's not about funny. It's not about being funny at all, okay? It's about
 Oh, my God! I'm getting pissed off!
 You can't do the voice without the lips.
 Everybody calm down. Clearly, we're not gonna come to any conclusions here today, so let's move past it.
 Let's do something else.
 Okay, right. We can find something to do. Let's just figure it out. Let's put our heads together. Come on. Think, think. So, you want to take them to New York?
 Yes, to Broadway.
 Oh. I tell you what. I brought it up
 the kids are super stoked about it.
 Now, let's talk hotel rooms.
 Um, you know, I

 I guess the first point I'd like to make

 Mm-hmm?
 Uh, Miss Reynolds, is, uh, you are a substitute.
 That's right. So I really don't think you should be hauling students across state lines.
 Hmm.
 Secondly
 Secondly, the funding for arts programs here is pretty much

 It's pretty much nonexistent.
 Hmm. It's shameful, but that's the way it is. So even if I did have the money, I would never

 And I emphasize never

 Mm-hmm. give it to someone whom I've just met. Knock, knock, knock. Uh, am I interrupting?
 Yes, we were right in the middle of something.
 Yes, thank you.
 She's not giving you too much trouble, is she?
 No. Oh, my gosh.
 So you two know each other.
 No, we met in

 Yeah, we're best friends.
 Best friends.
 We're best friends.
 Excellent. Uh, Principal MacIntyre, I recently, uh
 I started mentoring one of the kids here. Really? That's odd, because you're a janitor. Yeah. Uh, but Richie here is a hell of a kid, and he's struggling. You see, he's what he calls, uh, a juggler.
 Juggalo, bro.
 Juggalo. He's a Juggalo.
 Juggalo.
 It's sort of a clown posse. I figured you and I were getting tight enough that I could maybe come in here and ask that he be allowed to wear his makeup in school. Uh, well, uh, you know, it's school policy that no one should paint their face. So that's the rule, and that's the end of that.
 That's the rule.
 Yep.
 There's no wiggle room there.
 No. Tell you what. I'll take him to the locker room, lather him up real good. I'll strip all these silly-ass clothes off him, and I'll clean him sparkling clean.
 Brand-new kid for you. Bring him back up.
 No. No, no. Please don't bathe the students. You're right. He's a big man. He can bathe himself, can't you, Rich?
 Yeah, dawg.
 He's bathing himself, and I'm watching. Let's go, Richie. You're getting cleaned up. Come on! I'd rather you didn't do that either. Okay, there it is. Al Jolson in The Jazz Singer.
 How is that not racist to you?
 What? This is a terrible example of blackface. This guy isn't trying to look like a real person. He almost got the mouth right. See, that's what I'm saying about the lips. The lips are the most offensive part. The guy is bugging his eyes out like a cartoon character, okay? This is racist as shit. All blackface is racist, and that is the point I'm trying to make. You just cannot cast a white man as a black man and paint his face black.
 You can't do it.
 They're actors. They're trying to create an illusion. In The Lord of the Rings movie, Ian McKellen plays a wizard. Do you think he goes home at night and shoots laser beams into his boyfriend's asshole? I don't think so, dude. Tom Cruise is a midget but he plays guys that are normal size in movies.
 But again, nobody's buying that either.
 Okay, look at this. This is Laurence Olivier in Othello, and this is James Earl Jones.
 Now, look at how close they look.
 Look at that. James Earl Jones is doing a great blackface. James Earl Jones has a black face! He's a black man.
 He's not black.
 Of course, he's black! He was Darth Vader! Darth Vader was black.
 See? Okay, there we go.
 Darth Vader was not black. They took the mask off. He was white.
 I'm telling you, look, look. We got to agree on this.
 The whole idea is getting the right color shoe polish.
 No! Frank, if you're starting with shoe polish, you're starting off on the wrong foot, buddy. No way. Shoe polish? And he's on your side. Stop arguing for me, okay? I got it. Hold on. This is Dee. Let's
 Hey, hey, Dee. Uh, can you weigh in on something for us?
 We're trying

 Hey, no. No time. Listen, I need you to do something for me. Can you clear out the bar? I'm gonna bring some students from the classroom by, and we're gonna screen a movie there.
 Why?
 Because I need these kids to respect me, you know and I want to show 'em how cool I am, so

 Plus, I feel like this would be a really good opportunity to Dennis, cover it up. This is an opportunity to screen Laurence Olivier's Othello movie, you know?
 Then we can get an audience to weigh in.
 That's not a bad idea. We can really take the temperature on this with a large group.
 Yeah. Kids are honest as shit.
 Yeah.
 Hi! Hello!
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Dee, we're on it.
 We'll take care of the movie.
 No, no. You're not taking care of the movie. You're not railroading me on this, okay? This is my thing. It's my movie. Don't- I'll do the movie. No, Dee, it's a classic, okay? It's Shakespeare. Othello. Laurence Olivier. Come on. Othello? Oh. I'm sorry. I have to apologize. That's actually a really good idea. Ooh, plus, it'll give me the opportunity
 Okay, enough of that. Guys, let's get set up for a screening. All right. We're gonna do it. Uh, gentlemen, hello. How do you do? Long time no see. I'd like to introduce you to my protégé Richie. Richie, these are the guys. Say hello.
 What up? Juggalo for life.
 What the hell is he talking about?
 Drop it with the Juggalo thing. You're embarrassing me.
 Nah, I'm cool. Okay. Now, I know you're all super stoked about watching a movie in a bar but we're just gonna keep it on the down low. You know what I mean? We don't need your parents and the principal finding out.
 It's just our little secret.
 I've been in a bar before.
 No, you haven't.
 I've been in this bar before, so
 Okay, you know what? Let's just watch the movie and stop with our smart mouths. Uh, without further "adieu," Othello. So I guess this is a Shakespearean movie. It's gonna be a little bit boring. Oh, shit! Lethal Weapon 5! This is great.
 What the hell is this?
 It's our movie. It's a much more modern-day example of blackface.
 It's the most direct way to clear up our argument, Dee, so What argument?
 What are you talking about?
 Shh! The movie's on. This is a good movie, Richie. You're gonna enjoy this. Man, I ain't seen the first couple, though. Happy retirement, Rog. I'll be happy when I'm far away from your sorry ass, Riggs. Just blow out the candles, Rog. Make a wish. Uh, I never know what to wish for with these damn things.
 That voice really is amazing, dude.
 Oh, thanks, man. Thank you. Riggs, Murtaugh! Bad news, fellas. Hey, Captain. Turns out another person just died from tainted tap water. Turns out someone taint
 Someone tapped the tainted water supply. We should have cut him out completely. The person who just died was your wife. Riggs. Yeah, Rog. I just thought of my wish.
 Yeah. You see him right there?
 Oh, I see him. You like sharks, Detective? Powerful and majestic creatures. What is going on? Where are you? Frank splurged on a green screen. But he wouldn't pay for the green screen on our side, so

 We're not in the back office.
 We're in a casino. Why would I know anything about the tainted water? Maybe because your rival tribe owns the water rights to half of Los Angeles. I need clean drinking water too! Even sharks need water. Excuse me. If you leave now I have some pressing matter to deal with. Ahh. Tsk. Kinda comes out of nowhere but at least it's classy. Here comes the turn. I don't know why we, uh
 Oh, Chief! Don't say anything. Quiet! Quiet. Good. Very nice. Oh!
 Oh, come on.
 This is unwatchable.
 Gotta dive in.
 Just finish already! Now that you are Riggs and not Murtaugh and I have caught you alone, you are going to get it.
 Wait. You guys switched parts?
 Yeah, yeah. As more people die the city will be looking to new resources for water like my tribe! And you can bet your boots, Detective that this time
 This is regrettable. You're supposed to be a noble people. I tire of this conversation. Do you have any last words? Yeah, I got some last words. Go suck an egg. Yeah, go suck an egg. Go suck an egg? Sounds like you guys are having a great party. Why wasn't I invited? Oh! Yaah! Ah! It's playing. It's playing. This is the greatest movie I've ever seen. Are you filming this, Richie? No. Come on, dude. That's bootlegging. I'll get you a copy. Don't bootleg. Okay. You want to dance? All right, Chief Lazarus. How 'bout a little tainted tap water? Yes! Yes! Yeah! Great job, Rog. That's one fried turkey. All right. Let's get out of here. We got 'im, baby. I miss ya, kid. # There's a haunted dwarf sittin' on my porch # # Gonna beat me up- # Okay. Wow. I think that video says more than I ever could. As does that.
 Right.
 Mm-hmm. So, we're fired, yeah?
 Oh, absolutely.
 Yeah. Probably never should have been hired in the first place, though, huh?
 That was my bad.
 Mmm.
 Right, that's on you.
 Yeah, I probably won't be here much longer myself.
 No, I don't imagine you will, on account of the
 I got something that might cheer us all up. Who wants a little bit of

 Little bit of deliciousness here?
 I'm not gonna eat that.                     Good morning, South Philadelphia Animal Shelter. Yes, hello, I would like to apply for an adoption, please. Hey, what are you guys talking about? We're adopting a dog-fighting pit bull. We're gonna keep it in the bar, all right? Well, why wasn't I consulted about this? Because last time we tried to get a junkyard dog, we wound up getting a junkyard cat, and that's exactly where you're gonna go with it. Yeah. Because I don't want some goddamn snarling hellhound running around inside of our bar! Are you crazy? Look, we're going to rehabilitate the dog, okay? We don't want it to attack other dogs. Now we would like for it to attack people. If it attacks a person, great! Yeah. And, if the dog-- or when the dog-- bites a customer, that person then can go home and have a great story for their friends. It's a win-win for everybody. That's true! You can go, like, "Dude, I got bit a pit bull in a bar." In Paddy's! It was awesome! Awesome! And if you're an intruder, you should get bit by a pit bull. I don't understand. See, the biggest Uh, how long do you think this process usually takes? Just a dial tone now. She just hung up on me, for some reason. Wait for me in the back back. Okay, babe. Hey, who's that? It's my new girlfriend-- Roxy. That woman seems like a prostitute. That's because she is. You're dating a prostitute? Not for long. I'm gonna make that whore my wife. What the hell? I don't know. Are they? Oh, no! You did not just do that. Oh-ho-ho. That-that broad is a live wire. I'm goin' outside, 'cause this place is shit hole! What are you cocks lookin' at? Frank that woman is unspeakably crass. You're gonna marry that, Frank? She's been my number-one girl for a long while now. But she's still plowing other dudes. In fact, Tiger Woods has been calling her lately. No. No, no, no. That can't be the truth. That's bullshit. There is no way that Tiger Woods is interested in that woman. Look, can't you find someone who loves you for who you are? That woman's only in it for the money! Mm-mm! Let me stop you real quick. Someone love Frank for who he is? Come on! No! He's got a ton of good qualities. Yes, he does! I mean, like what? Like what? Dude, the other day, we were hanging out under the bridge; we found box of denim, and I'm, like, "You know, these look like good jeans in here," and he's, like, "You want to split it with me, 50-50?" I mean, that's a nice thing to do. I wanted you to have half of that denim. He shared half the jeans. Charlie! Charlie! Stop wearing clothes you find washing up under bridges. Oh, they're boiled, yeah. Yeah! Yeah, we boil all our denim.
 Oh, good, well, they're boiled, so
 Hey! Hey, you know, there is some dirty crack whore in the alley, blowing the busboy from the restaurant down the street. This is exactly why we need that dog. Let's get that dog! Mac, you look bad. Really, really bad. What? Yeah, is that your shirt or my shirt? That's, like, way too small for you. You look fat as shit! Okay, okay, I'm getting very concerned with the integrity of our organization here. Mac, you have gained, I mean, 50 pounds of fat. Mass. Fat. Muscle. Let's be clear: fat. It's fat. Frank, you are talking about marrying hookers-- this is ridiculous! What's going on with our group? We're becoming the Gross Crew. The Gross Crew?! The Gross Crew. And I don't like that. I don't want that, all right? I don't want that. So, if we're gonna have this woman hanging around, then we gotta clean her up or something. I tell you what-- what if we took a Pretty Woman and threw it Roxy's way. Hey Pretty Woman? That was a bullshit movie. People don't change like that. People change, Frank. Look at me. I went from a tiny twink to the muscle-bound freak you see before you. You're not helping my argument. Okay, yeah, and if you're gonna chime in, please don't do it with a mouthful of burrito. This is a chimichanga. You are becoming a chimichanga! All right, all of you-- I'm gonna give you all 24 hours to do whatever you have to do, but, tomorrow night, I am proposing to that dirty whore. This is gonna be a little bit harder than we thought. This woman is a real piece of shit. Uh-huh. Where's Frank? Don't worry about Frank, Roxy. We're here to help you turn your life around. See, a lot of times, the second act of someone's life can be much better than the first. Mm-hmm. Well, yeah, we just want to make some changes in your life, Roxy. Perhaps get you some new clothes. Uh-huh. Uh, hopefully, teach you some manners. Shut up, baby dick. All right, well, I'm out of here. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, I Don't go, don't go. We haven't even started yet. Come on Frank was right. This woman cannot change. People don't just change. People change! She can change. I'm gonna change. What? You're gonna change?! What the hell are you talking about? Well, I'm gearing up to get into my second act, you know? And that's very exciting for me. And I'd like to help Roxy do the same thing, that's all. No no, no, Dee. Aw, really? What? No, you're already in your second act. Me? Yeah. We're all in our second acts-- don't you see that? And I, for one, I don't want things to change. I want them to stay the way they were, because my first act was awesome. See, your first act was-was shit, and that's why you're so desperate for things to be different. But they rarely ever do get different. If anything-- God, they get worse. I mean, look at Mac. I got salsa on my shirt. He got salsa on his shirt. Okay here's howhings need to go from here on out. You gotta deal with this woman, because I can't handle it all right? She made things personal, and I won't stand for that. Somebody needs to take care of Mac, and that's gonna be me, because his fatness is starting to affect our entire crew. Mm-hmm. So I'm gonna take him with me, because the man is carrying around trash bags filled with Mexican foods. What's that smell? Crack. That is crack rock. Mm-hmm. She's smoking crack! Oh, she's smoking crack. Okay, she's smoking crack. Uh, this is no longer a safe environment for me. Mac, let's go. Come on, I gotta get out of here. Whew! I got a really good thing going with Roxy. She's a sweet bitch. Yeah, but she's mean. She's definitely only into you for the money. Well, so, Barbara was only into me for the money. Yeah, but you deserve better than that, man. Look, I'm already on it, okay? I signed you up on a dating Web site. I got you a date, dude! Yeah? Check it out, though. I got a little twist on this date. This girl does think she's meeting a millionaire. Why'd you say that, Charlie? That defeats the purpose. Well, I'm gonna be the millionaire. Oh. Explain. All right, check it out. You're gonna play my limo driver, right? You're just like a regular working stiff to this girl. She doesn't think you're a millionaire, okay? Then we're out on the date and I'm, like, "Oh, I don't feel very well. I gotta go home. But let's not waste this date. Why don't you finish the date with my limo driver!" You know what I mean? Smart, Charlie. I mean, yeah, she's not gonna be able to resist an opportunity like that. A night with a limo driver? This is a good idea.
 Right?
 I'm gonna give it a whirl.
 All right, man!
 All right, Charlie! Oh, here, I think these are are done.
 That first one's done?
 Yeah, this batch is done. Just get 'em out. Get 'em out-- whoo, baby!
 Whoa! I burned myself on a rivet.
 Yeah Mac, these blood tests are going to show you the damage that you've been doing to your body, and my hope is that it will incentivize you to finally lose some of this disgusting weight you've put on. This is ridiculous, dude, okay? We're getting older. We're not going to look 20 forever. No, I am going to look 20 forever, Mac, because the older I get, the more vigilant I become. All right, I don't eat lunch anymore, for instance. Yeah, and on odd days, I don't eat breakfast. That sounds miserable. No, dude, it's not miserable. Well, yeah, it is a little bit miserable, but it has to be, man. No pain, no gain. I am also constantly in motion. Like, right now, dude, I am doing leg lifts that are imperceptible to the human eye. I call them hummingbirds. And although I seem relaxed, I'm actually incredibly tense at all times. Dude, we've been through this, okay? I'm cultivating mass. Stop staying that. You are not cultivating mass, and if you are, stop cultivating and start harvesting. Bro, check this out. Try to move me. Wow, I'm not going to try Try and move me, bro. Take a running start. Take a running start. Excuse me. Did you want me to read these test results or not? Yeah, I was just trying to trying to move him. He's like a brick wall. Yeah. You try to move me, Doc. No, no, no, you're Read the results, Doc. Well, I see, uh, severe dehydration here, multiple vitamin deficiencies, anemia, low blood pressure. Ooh. Mac, look, I don't want you to fret, okay? I'm going to get you on my exercise program. I'm going to get you fit as a fiddle. Uh, these are these are your results, Mr. Reynolds. What? No, those can't be my my results. I'm healthy as shit. Well, uh, not according to your tests. I'm healthier than you, bro. Well, I wouldn't exactly say you're healthy. You have type 2 adult-onset diabetes. Type 2 adult-onset diabetes? What does that mean for me? Well, that means you're going to have to inject yourself several times a day with insulin, or else you probably need to think about losing a little weight. Whoa. But I'm healthy besides the diabetes? Um, no. But I'm more healthier than he is, I think is the point that you're trying to make. Even with the diabetes. Dude, stop saying "diabetes!" You sound like an ass You okay, dude? I'm fine. I just, uh been doing a lot of hummingbirds today. I'm good. Have you eaten anything today? No. All right, let's get out of here, bro. I'm going to get you something to eat. All right. I'm going to lift you up. What the hell? I'm not as strong as I thought, Dennis. Okay, I've hurt my back. I'm shit-faced. Yeah, well, you downed that bottle of schnapps like it was a soda pop. Look, Roxy, I'm trying to give you a second chance here, but you're making it very difficult. Hey, this jacket is awesome. Ooh, and it's tighter than dick skin, man. Can you watch your language, please, Roxy? We're in a classy place with classy clothes for classy people, okay? Don't talk about dick skin. Hi. Can I help you with something? No, thank you. We're just trying some stuff on. Um, okay. Well, you are aware that jacket is $500. Are you implying we can't afford that? Can you? That's none of your business. Um, it's exactly my business. Excuse me. Screw your dick skin jacket, man. Oh, no, no, no! No, no, no, no, Roxy, Roxy! Oh, God, no, don't do that. How do you like me now, gay boy? Well, now, okay, okay. Don't call him gay, 'cause it'd be one thing if he wasn't, but he clearly is, so Is there a problem? Yeah, there's a problem, man. I'm trying to buy this coat, and this asshole here is giving me shit. You are aware of the price. Well, here. 'Cause I have money. Oh, shit! Jerry, can I talk with you in my office, please? You have got to be kidding me. Oh, oh, face, Jerry, face! Take a hike! Sorry about the gay stuff. That did cross the line. Jerry, please, my office. Roxy! Holy shit. That was amazing. You humiliated that salesman, and then you had the capital to back it up. I love you, Roxy. Ooh, I got to meet a client. No, no, no, Roxy, you don't have to do that anymore. You know what? We should go find Frank, 'cause he's got a surprise for you. No, it's Tiger Woods. It's Tiger Woods? Yeah. Okay, th-this whole thing is blowing my mind. Your life is way more glamorous than what I was picturing. Yeah, yeah. Now, help me dig these crack rocks out of my ass. That's what I was picturing. Yeah. That's more like what I was picturing. Charlie, I feel like a sack of shit in this thing. You look good. I feel like I'm a I'm a four year old going to my sister's wedding. You're the limo driver. You got to look the part, bud. You don't look like a millionaire. I am a casual millionaire from Texas. You look like a farmer. Frank, I got the whole thing worked out. Now, listen to me. We got out on the date.

Uh, and that's true fortune, if you're asking me, to have that. So you build bridges. Um, uh I-I'm kind of into bridges myself. Yeah. I I-I found a whole case of eggs under a bridge last week-- perfect condition. None of them missing. None of them cra*** ced. I mean, who in their right mind throws away a perfectly good case of eggs this day and age? I mean, it's a sick world, don't you think? Ah, he's good with the conversation and Excuse me. Excuse me.

You know, you two can go to dinner together. Help me somebody! Please, help me! Aw, shit, Charlie, what the hell went on back there? I swallowed, like, a million blood caplets 'cause I was gonna cough, like, you know, a handful of blood to make it it real. And not I'm thinking, like, you're not supposed to eat them or something 'cause they're making me really sick. Aw, Charlie, you blew it. You're the one talking about eggs and crabs and shit. I love eggs, Charlie. I like eggs. And I love crabs. I like crabs. And I love boiling denim and banging whores! I love boiling Well And I don't care if anybody doesn't like that about me.

Tell you what, if it's Roxy you want That's the last of it, I think. Tiger Woods? I cannot believe you invited him over here, Roxy. My place is a mess. Oh, he's here. Are you ready? I'm ready.

I'm very famous. No, no, no, no, hold on a second. Roxy, this is not Tiger Woods. What are you talking about? This guy's an actor. He definitely pretended to be Donovan McNabb one time when I tried out for the Eagles. Donovan McNabb? Eagles? I don't know what she's talking about. I play golf. Okay, Roxy, see, this is exactly why you gotta stop doing this shit. And, sir, seriously? Okay, all right, all right, I'm sorry. You got me, all right? I'm busted. I am an actor. My name is Don Cheadle. No, you're not Don What are you doing?! What's going on? I don't care who he is if he pays me 500 bucks to rub my feet. Did you say 500 bucks? Mm-hmm. To rub your feet? Mm-hmm. You don't have sex with him? Mm-mm-mmm. I'm into foot shit. Interesting What shoe size are you, by the way? Hey, your feet are bizarrely huge. Man will go crazy for that. I don't care for how you describe them, but what are we talking here? What kind of money are we talking? I don't know maybe we could pop those boots off and kick it around a bit. Well, it never hurts to talk, does it? Just do it. He's cute. Oh, God. Chimichanga, chimichanga, chimichanga, chimichanga, chimichanga. Mac, chimichangas are delicious. I told you, dude. So good, oh! I told you. Why would you not want to eat one of these every single day of your life? Oh, my God! I mean, they're delicious, they're full of carbs, which is great for a pump. And they're cheap as shit. Hence the garbage bags filled with them. Exactly. No restrictions. No restrictions. Oh, I love this no restrictions thing, man. Now in that vein, I want you to take a look at that chimichanga. I want you to say to yourself, "Chimichanga, you are delicious, but what do I really want?" What I really want? What do you want more than anything else in the entire world? What do I want more than anything else in this entire world? Yes. Crack. Oh. I thought you were gonna say pizza or buffalo wings or something. Yeah, no, no, no. You want crack? Yeah, crack cocaine. Now, I've never had crack. Dude, you are going to love it. I am? It's so good. Let's do it! No restrictions, baby, no restrictions. No restrictions. Aw, man, this is gonna be awesome, dude. Do you want some insulin? Oh, shit. Yo. Uh-huh. You did what now? Oh, she is? I don't get it, but I don't need to. Okay, we'll see you there. Okay, bye. Um, dude, so, apparently, Charlie just puked blood all over some lady in a limousine and Dee is sucking off Don Cheadle or something? And Frank wants to go ahead and get married to Roxy as soon as possible. So we got to fire down there. Dude, we can get crack from Roxy. Let's get crack from Roxy, Okay, perfect. Now do you want some of this insulin? No, I just want crack. Okay, we'll get down there. And on the way, let's fire down to John Wanamaker's and get ourselves a couple of Tommy Bahama shirts. Are you familiar? Yeah, see what you mean about these shirts, bro. Yeah. You'll grow into yours, buddy. Yeah, comfy as shit. They hide your fatness. You know, they're ugly as all hell, but I have a feeling I'm gonna like 'em a lot more when I'm high as shit on crack. What's up, basticks? Basticks? Is that how you're gonna talk from now on? Look, I'm not taking no shit no more, so get used to it. Also, I'm gonna become a foot girl. All right, gross. Whatever. Frank, you ready? Oh, yeah. I'm ready. Okay, Roxy, Frank would like to say a few words. Everybody. Gather round. Roxy Frank. You are good shit, and I want to make this legit. I'm still gonna pay you, but I want you to stop banging other guys. What do you say? Want to be my wife or what? Holy shit. Oh-oh, my God. Oh, my Uh ooh Whoops. Christ! No, it's okay. She does this from time to time. She's had an excessive amount to drink, so yeah. Okay. Well, Roxy, get up. Roxy Come on, Roxy. Roxy? Big day for Frank here. Roxy, we don't have a ton of time, Rox. Get up! The bitch is dead! How could she be dead? I'm telling you her heart popped. She was smoking crack in the car the whole way here and also all day long. She got no pulse. Oh, my God! Holy shit! Call 911! Call an ambulance. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no, no. No, no, no! No, no, no, I'm sorry. Whoa, whoa, what? I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Uh, we gotta think this through, okay? Dead hooker in my apartment? That doesn't look good for me. I'm covered in blood. I mean, not good to have a dead hooker, right? It would kind of mess up our second acts a little bit. And I'll tell you guys something. I smoked a little crack in the car on the way over. Oh, you bitch! Oh, does she still have any? Yeah, yeah. > We can't leave her here. No, no, we can't leave her here. Um, let's, uh Oh, God. Okay, well, I mean I don't want to sound insensitive, but we could just put her out in the hall. We call in an anonymous tip. So we're still calling 911 Someone finds her. just from a pay phone. This seems like the best thing to do considering the circumstances. Frank, what do you think? I think Roxy would have wanted it that way. Well, there you go. Frank would know. I mean, that's it! You would know, Frank. Can I say a few words? Make it nice. Let's make the whole thing nice. Really? I just want to get her out of here. Oh, nice. Roxy, God bless you. You were a good whore. You serviced me like no other whore ever did. Not only my crank, but my heart. And I'm gonna miss ya. Amen. So should we get the dead whore out of the apartment? Yeah, yeah, yeah,                        Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn! Hey! Burn, burn! Burn! Yeah, cool. What are you guys burning? Bunch of garbage and burns the tar that's just taking up space. No, goddamn it! Wait, Frank, why are you burning our photo album pictures? What do you mean? Because it's trash. You kidding me? Oh, my God! Dude, these are all the pictures from our Jersey Shore vacations. You were gonna burn these? Yeah. These were, like, the happiest days of our lives. Oh, come on, Jersey Shore sucked. The Shore didn't suck, Frank. You sucked, okay? You just complained the whole time and ruined it for everyone else. Yeah, because I had to do all the work. I never got to relax. I would love to go on a vacation. Oh, my God, me, too. I would love to go on a vacation. Yeah, but not to the Jersey Shore, though. I mean, that place sounds like a nightmare. What's wrong with the Jersey Shore? Come on. You've seen that TV show. It's just a bunch of sweaty Guidos getting hopped up on energy drinks and giving each other diseases. Yeah, no, the Jersey Shore is nothing like that. It's a magical place where people swim in the ocean and they get to ride on fun rides and they get to have their first kiss. Dude, you would love it. Well, hang on a second. I've never seen the ocean. I could get into that if you guys want to go down to the Shore. Aw, yes! Yes! We should all go to the Shore together. I'll tell you what. Maybe I'll knock myself out and we'll head down to the Shore. Yeah, but I feel like you're just gonna screw it up if you try and knock yourself out. Yeah, you're probably gonna come to halfway there, and then complain the rest of the time. Yeah, I'll tell you what. Why don't I take the rag, I'll get the chloroform, I'll get you when you least expect it. All right, sweet. Yeah? Yeah! Goin' down to the Jersey Shore! Yeah, going to the Shore, baby! Now, this ocean, explain it to me. It's, like, it goes on forever? Go to sleep, go to sleep. So, I woke up, like, halfway there, and then you just snuffed me out again, huh, Mac? Oh, this place turned into a major shithole. It does not look exactly the way I remember it looking. No, no, it's different, it's different. The guy at the front desk said there was meth lab explosion, so the hotel burned down. They had to rebuild it. Something like that. There's a smell, too, like Don't sweat it, you guys. Listen, with any luck at all, we won't be spending any time here, so just think of it more like a locker. Yes! I'm sorry, is no one gonna talk about Dee's hair? Oh, I was waiting to pounce. I just didn't know what our cue was. Yeah, I was waiting for Dennis to jump on top of it. And then we were gonna slay her. Yeah. No, no. It's fine. All the cool girls get their hair braided at the Shore. I think she looks like Bo Derek. Thank you, Dennis. Mm-hmm. You see, Dee and I have some very fond memories of the Shore. We're not gonna have you sullying those great memories with all your goddamn insults. Mm-mm. Are you drinking sunscreen? No, no, it's a decoy. We're drinking tequila out of sunscreen bottles. Very strict open container laws here at the Jersey Shore. Cheers. Holy shit! Is that the ocean?! Yep. Yeah, buddy, that's the ocean. What's on the other side of it there? Europe. Yeah. Now, how long would it take? Do not try and swim to Europe. No. Don't swim to Europe? Do not. As a matter of fact, why don't you stick with Dee and I because we can show you the ropes here at the Jersey Shore. All right, everybody, you know what time it is! Let's go strut the beach. Not strutting shit. No beach strutting for me. I'm gonna find a place to relax and unwind. Frank, I'm with you. Yeah. Why don't you grab us some booze? I'll go down to the beach and get us some prime real estate before those gorilla dickheads get down there. Yeah. Gonna relax. Let's do it! Let's get out of here. Oh, man, this ocean breeze feels so good on my scalp. Yeah, it feels awesome. The sand feels good beneath my feet. Uh-huh. I'm a little curious as to where all the people are, though. No idea, no idea. Didn't want to say anything, didn't want to ruin the mood, but where are the people? I'm seeing a lot more dogs than people, right? There are a shit-ton of dogs out here, I tell ya. Where are their masters? I don't think these dogs have masters. I think these dogs play by their own rules. Well, clearly, the action has shifted elsewhere. Want to go to the boardwalk? Hey, let's go to the boardwalk! Yes! Yeah! Hey, Charlie! Charlie! Come here! Dude, oh, my God, this place is amazing! Right? Yeah! And the sun block drink? Nice, guys. They're really good. They're really good. Thing is, I didn't make you one. Oh! Jesus Chris, Charlie! You're drinking sun block. It's good. It gets you, it gets you all. Yeah, you're ingesting viscous chemicals, and they're getting you high. Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter. Okay, we're going to the boardwalk. What do you say? Oh, really? You want to leave? Yeah. I feel like we're just scratching the surface of all the cool shit out here. What cool shit? Well, the sea specimens, the stray dogs, the trash that floated over from Europe. Yeah, but we didn't come here to play with stray dogs and trash, man. We came here to soak up the culture. And the boardwalk is the cultural center of the Jersey Shore, so let's go there. Come on, man! Yeah, all right. Goin' to the boardwalk. Yo, Mac, you see that sign there that says "Taxic spill"? Yeah. What's that? Disregard that, Frank. It's a bunch of liberal bullshit. Right, right. This is a nice spot. Yeah, yeah. Whoa! What's that? You were supposed to get booze. Oh, this is ham soaked in rum. It is loaded with booze. Goddamn it, Frank, eating your drinks? That is genius! Ow! What? What the What the What is that? Oh, yeah. I got stuck with a needle. Yeah, that's a syringe. Be careful. They are everywhere. The beach is full of syringes. Why is that? Well, we're in the steroid capital of the world, Frank. To be honest with you, as a man who works very hard to maintain a certain level of physical excellence, I find shortcuts insulting. Now give me a piece of ham now. Hey, check that out. What the hell's a dog doing here? Hey, hey, get out of here! Get out of here! Get out of here! Goddamn dogs, I'm telling you, dude. The were lurking before, now they're swarming. I'm not sharing my ham with no dogs. I got a great idea. Hey, warm sun, cool ocean breezes, getting rip-shit on ham. Might you say we're getting "hammered." Oh, nice one. This is a great idea, Frank. Great idea. This is 90-proof ham. Screw you mutts! Get out of here, you bitch! Come and get it. Stupid dogs. We outsmarted those dogs, Frank. Dude, this is the boardwalk, man. This is amazing. Yeah, it's a little bit more desolate than I was hoping it would be, but Yeah, but that's okay. It's still really great. Oh, Charlie, there's all kinds of rides and games and opportunities to win stuffed toys. Yeah, man, the boardwalk is a blast, man. But it is under the boardwalk where the action really happens. Trust me, pal. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Oh, what's down there? Oh, Charlie, come on. So under the boardwalk's where it's at? Yeah, man. This is gonna knock your socks off. You never know who you're going to run into, what they're gonna be doing. You love the bridge, right? Yeah. This is a lot like being under the bridge, I would think. It's way better than that. Under the boardwalk is a magical place, man. I have a special place in my heart 'cause I had my first kiss down here. Mm-hmm. Did you? Oh, dude, all kinds of romantic shit happens Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, no! No! No! No! No! What was that?! Two homeless guys banging each other. I saw, but why? That's not magical. That's not romantic. That's your idea of romantic? No! There are other kinds of romances that happen under here. I don't want to see anything else like that. You know what, I'm out of here. 'Cause you guys are perverted. You get out of here. You get out of here. You get out of here, Charlie. Son of a bitch. Aw! Where's the beach? Frank, wake up. What? What's the matter? Where's the beach? Uh, I don't know. We're in the middle of the goddamn ocean! Yes, we are. What are we gonna do? Well, we're going to conk out for a while and let the current gently roll us back to shore. Frank, the current is what brought us out here in the first place. If anything, we should be paddling against it to get back to the beach. I'm going to pretend like I didn't hear that. Frank, Frank, we are no longer in relaxing mode. We are now in survival mode. Will you stop being so dramatic? Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Where's the rum ham? Where's the rum? Aw! Rum ham! No, Frank, stay in the boat. Rum ham! Frank, stay in the boat. I want rum ham! I'm sorry, rum ham. I'm sorry, rum ham. Oh, rum ham. Yeah, this is going to be great, right? Of course it is. Nothing like some good, innocent, wholesome, above-the-boardwalk fun to, uh, get us back on track. Yes. Take a step back from the situation. Get a clearer perspective. Yeah, and then we'll plummet propel us forward into an awesome evening. Yeah. And hopefully cleanse us of the horrifying events that we've just witnessed. These beads are really digging into my back. Wind I don't know. I don't know if we should have come back here. I think we made a mistake, because we have so many memories Oh, no. Is my hair stuck? Yeah. It feels it's. Yeah? Oh, yeah. Well, get it. No. Get it out, because we're about to drop Get it! Stick your hand You think I'm going to stick my fingers into the machinery? Hey, hey, you down there. Do not make it go, because my hair is stuck, and something terrible will happen. Oh, that's really in there. Oh, you idiot, stop the ride! Don't make it fall! Ow! Hey. How you holding up, sis? Not well, Dennis. Not well. Do you have any id how horrifying it was to ride that back up to get my hair? Yeah, well, be thankful you got it back. I just want to get my scalp sewnack on and get the hell out of this miserable town. I'm starting to wonder what the hell we ever saw in this place, you know what I mean? I mean, look at this girl. What's her story? She's got a decent bone structure. She was probably very pretty when she was young. Yeah. Probably spent her summers here, lounging on the beach and scooping ice cream. But she didn't want her summers to end, so she got herself a fake I.D. and a push-up bra and started hanging out at the local bars. Right. Developed a nasty coke habit, 'cause she loved the way it made her feel. Mm-hmm. Extreme highs gave way to extreme lows and she fell into a depression. Had herself a kid. Thought it would give her a sense of purpose. And it did, for a while, until she started using again. Mm-hmm. And then social services came knocking at the door, and now the kid lives upstate with his grandparents, 'cause she can't take care of this kid. And here she is festering away in a one-bedroom apartment waiting for the HIV to turn into AIDS. And wondering what the hell You know I can hear you, right? Oh, sorry. We were just using you as a metaphor, though. Yeah. We didn't mean anything personal. Don't sweat it. You're not that far off. Hey. Hey, baby. Jesus, are you seeing this? Mm-hmm. God, even the doctors in this town are drug dealers. Oh, hey, wait. What are you doing? Who are you? Where did you come from? Get out of here. Drop it. No. Goddamn it! Goddamn you! I hate this town, Dennis. I hate this town. Okay, okay, all right, well calm down. It's understandable. You are missing a piece of your scalp. Yeah. Sounds like you two could use a break. Want to come party with me and my friends? Yeah. Yes. Mm-hmm. I'm so thirsty. Gargle some more water, bitch. I've been gargling. Well, don't snap at me. Well, quit acting so bossy. Okay, you know what, guy, we can't fight, all right? We're both very cranky. We haven't eaten in a very long time. I'm starving. Okay, all right, look, maybe I'll dive down there, I'll spear a tuna, I'll wrestle him on board and we'll feast. Boom, let's eat. All right, give me the knife. I can't give you the knife. What? Why not? 'Cause there may come a time when difficult decisions must be made, and I'd rather be the one with the knife. What difficult decisions? What are you talking about? You know, like things you do to stay alive. Are you talking about killing and eating me, Frank? All I'm saying is, that when you go into survival mode, it's every man for himself. You seem like you're in survival mode right now. Maybe I am, maybe I ain't, rum ham. Did you just call me rum ham? Frank, Frank, we cannot be talking about killing and eating each other already, okay? Tell that to the rum ham. Stop talking about the goddamn rum ham. It should have been you! No! Jesus Oh, no! Uh-oh. You see what you've done? You've murdered us both, you son of a bitch. Oh, shit, what's that? It's a boat! It's a boat! We're saved! Is that an Italian flag? It's the Guidos. Guidos, we're here. Over here. Oh! No way. Charlie? Hey. Oh, my God, what are you doing down here? Did you follow me all the way to the Jersey Shore? No! No, I swear. I'm just out here but that's cool! Can you believe we're That's like destiny! What What's in your hand? Something stupid I found. No big deal. Can I see it? Yeah. Wow. That's really beautiful. I'll tell you what, I mean I think that's a pretty rare one, but you can keep it if you want. Thanks, Charlie. Sure. So you going to insult me and walk away? Or, or what's going on here? No, I, um I don't, I don't know, you know? I love the beach so much, and it's so beautiful. I could probably just hang out here for a little while. Cool. Just don't go under the boardwalk. Okay. Guys, this is Dennis and Dee. I told them they could roll with us tonight. Yeah, uh, hi. Yeah, we're, uh, looking forward to partying with you all tonight. Does Bobby know about this? Don't worry, they're cool. Yeah. So, uh what are we getting into tonight, you guys? Yeah! Just waiting for Bobby. Then we're gonna hit the liquor store. All right, cool. Yeah, well, you can't have a party without liquor. That's right. So yeah. Let's hit the liquor store. Who the hell are these two? Well, you're Bobby, I guess. Uh, we are just new acquaintances of your friend Stephanie over here. Harmless people. You guys cool? Yeah. Well, I hate to toot my own horn, but I am pretty cool, Bobby. Hit that. Yeah. And I can tell by the way you're staring at me that you're wondering if I'm cool, too. Ooh. I'm just going to go ahead and nip that in the bud right now, so Oh, shit. That does not taste like weed. It burns a lot. It's angel dust. Angel Dust. Embrace the night. What's over there?  Just can't seem to get my mind off of you  Beer, beer, beer, beer! All right, you guys ready to get it? Yes, yes! Let's go, let's go, let's go! No! Yeah! Wha? What's happening? What's happening?  Vacation all I ever wanted vacation, had to get away  Vacation meant to be spent alone  Hi! Drive! Drive now! You!

What the Did you rape me last night? What? No. Gross, no! Then Okay, why am I waking up next to you on a deserted beach? 'Cause we fell asleep here last night. What's going on with you? Oh, my God. I was I was on Ecstasy last night, Charlie. You have to tell me everything that happened. Oh! Boy, you're really off the wagon, huh? Drinking, drugs Oh, my God. Well, it was a cool night. I mean, we laughed, we collected sea specimens, we drank some ocean, you got a little sick from drinking the ocean. I loved it, though. That sounds really weird and gross. Oh, really? Well, I suppose now you think this is weird and gross. Oh my God, Charlie, come on! What? Hang on a second, where you going? Uh, let's see. Last night I lived out one of my actual nightmares. So I'm going to go, and take a shower. Well, hang on. Hang on a second. I suppose you want this back. What is that? That's a jewel you gave me. You said you wanted me to have it. Charlie, that's a piece of a broken glass bottle. All right. Well, maybe I'll see you Friday or something. No! No! Okay. Hmm. I guess that's just summer love. Crazy. Bro, our night was way more amazing. And it actually happened. What do you mean, it actually happened? Why do you keep saying that? You don't think I spent the night with the waitress? No! Then where'd I get this, dude? Where'd I get that? I assume you got it out of the trash, or dug it out of a storm drain somewhere. I don't believe you're not Whoa! Here they come. Okay. All right. Everyone get in the car! Go, let's go! Get in the car! Come on, come on, come on! Guys, you will not believe the night we had! I don't care, there is no meaning to life anymore. It takes a classy man to admit when he was wrong.
 And I was wrong. I love the Jersey Shore.
 Oh, you love it? Oh, you love it so much here, get in the goddamn car, you fat fat ass, fat fat ass. *** Oh, man, they talk awesome. I don't know why these guys get such a bad rep. It's pretty cool. Let me tell you something, Mac. There are far worse people in Jersey Shore than the cast of The Jersey Shore. It's a horrible town. It's a horrible town filled with horrible people. I don't know about that. I think it's a magical town. Hell yeah. Beautiful magical town.                      No, we never had kings in this country. No, I don't think we ever had kings. That was the whole point of this country is that we didn't want a king. We didn't want the king. Son of a bitch! Guys, guys, guys. Oh. Are you okay? Oh! Oh! I think you broke your nose. I'm screwed. I'm screwed. Ah! Oh, strange man, titty bar. A great investment opportunity. Beauty pageant. Are you getting it? Yeah, yeah, I think I got this. You met a strange man at a titty bar who offered you a great opportunity to invest in a beauty pageant? Everything looked very legit. It was all in place. He had all the connections. He wanted somebody to front the money. Me. Okay, fine. I've always wanted to do a beauty pageant. Stop. Why? Because you make a lot of cash, and you ogle some broads. Yeah, I don't question that aspect of it. Yeah, that seems right up your alley, bro. Oh, this jerk gets pinched for coming on to one of the contestants, and now it looks like a whole scam. And if I don't legitimize this thing, everybody's gonna think I'm just like him. Why don't you just drop the whole thing? I can't, Charlie. It's already going. It's in motion. I mean, it's really a mess. Any second now, there's gonna be broads walking through that door in swimsuits. Awesome. That's a good thing. Yeah, I don't see what the problem is here, Frank. Oh! Looks like somebody forgot their swimsuit. Come on, girls. That's the problem. A kids' pageant. I didn't know Are you kidding me? I didn't know it was a kids' pageant. The guy didn't make that clear. Now I'm lumped in with a diddler. What am I gonna do? This is a mess. Well, I don't know what the big deal is. You know, I did pageants all the time when I was little. The big deal? The big deal is that mothers force their kids into this so that they can dress them up like dolls and parade them around like sex objects. It's creepy. My mother didn't force me into it. I entered them myself. Yeah, that's true. Actually, when Dee used to enter pageants when we were kids, Mom used to tell her not to waste her time, because she isn't pretty enough. Mm-hmm, she would say that, and then I would jam it right in her face when I'd win them. How would you win pageants? Did you have a different face? No, she was a dog back then, too. It's just that she worked at it. She used to go to tanning, and you know, she practiced with her makeup. I'll give you that-- you did a lot of that practicing. Thanks, Frank. Yeah, yeah, you guys got to change your thinking about child pageants. I mean, child pageants-- that's American tradition right there. Child pageantry. Think about it. In other countries, okay, women that can't show their ankles, right? They got to be in those big, black tarps or whatever. Mm. In America, we can show toddlers in tiny bikinis, we can make them tan, because that's our right. Mm-hmm. As Americans, okay. Child pageantry is an essential part of the American fabric. You know what? We should dress up our little kids just to show other people that we can. Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah, I never thought about it that way. This is about freedom, isn't it? Mm-hmm. We can do whatever we want with our kids. Yeah. And that's what America is all about. You know what you just did, Charlie? You just loaded up that train with coal, and now it's ready to tear down the tracks. That was inspiring as hell. Yes. Let's throw ourselves a pageant! Let's do a child pageant. U.S.A. U.S.A., U.S.A., U.S.A., U.S.A., U.S.A.! Okay. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Good. Thank Calm down, everybody. Calm down. Calm down. Thanks for coming to Frank's Little Beauties. I want to thank you all for participating. I know some of you may have heard about that other guy. I am not gonna diddle your kids. I'm not like that. That's not my thing. I met that guy in a titty bar. It's like a That's enough. That's enough. Hi there. Dee Reynolds, former pageant winner. I know how these things work, so, uh, your kids are in good hands. Go ahead and talk amongst yourselves. Frank, will you? Frank, your nose is bleeding all over the place. Do I look suspicious? You look grotesque.  Magic night for us.   A magical night.  Magic's in the air.  Magic's   Magic's in the air Skeedy-bow.  Uh See, this is fun. Yeah. We shouldn't be looking at this pageant as a problem. We should be looking at this as an opportunity to do something we've never done before. This is right in our wheelhouse. I'm having a blast putting this Hey, I'm thinking maybe we could actually be in this thing? I'm glad you said it, because I'm desperate to be in this thing. Oh! I didn't realize it was even a conversation. I always assumed we would be heavily involved. This is bad. We got to definitely write a song about how we do not diddle kids.  Do not diddle kids It's no good diddling kids.  There is no quicker way for people to think that you are diddling kids than by writing a song about it. You got to write a song. It's just like Ooh.  I wouldn't do it with anybody Younger than my daughter And no little kids.  Got to be big Older than my wife Older than my daughter.  Something like that. Don't write a song about that. No. I'm cloudy. I got a headache. Uh, excuse me. Who's in charge here? Well, usually that's whoever yells the loudest, but I am the only one here right now, so I am in charge. Oh, hi. Uh, my name is Walter Harris. Hi. I'm with the Family Association for the Protection of Children. No! Ooh, ooh. Okay. Uh, you know, I I'm-I'm pretty much I'm in charge of this the chairs and setting up the chairs. Mm. But there's a guy. Uh, uh, there's a fat guy. Well, his face is busted to bits, and he he's in charge. He's-He's the guy that you want to talk to. He might be this way, so I'll go I'm gonna go back here and look for him. Uh, you check it out around the corner. Real jacked up face and fat. So, how's everyone doing today? Is everyone feeling safe? The F.A.P.C., huh? That's what he said. They're siccing the dogs after us. We're screwed. Hey, we're fine, Frank. We got nothing to hide. Yeah, you know what? To be honest with you, I'm glad he's gonna observe us. I mean, somebody should be looking out for these kids. Yeah, those mothers just left their kids here in a bar with complete strangers in a pageant that's under investigation. They're terrible parents. Yeah. This is a mess! Frank, why don't you go lay down and put some ice on your face, 'cause you look terrible? Yeah, Jesus, Frank, fix your face, for God sake. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Relax. Go, go. We'll take care of everything in here. Everything's gonna be fine, Frank. Yeah, we got it. We got it. It's all gonna be fine. Now you pinned the whole thing on him, right? Oh, yeah, of course I did. Hey, good thinking. Good. Good, good, good, good. Okay, ladies, chins up, hands down, step forward. One, two, three, one, two. Fan, turn. Hit it! Stick it! Let me see it! Pose! Come on, hit the line. Get in line. What is this? Guys, we got to put on a show! I thought you were professionals. That's what I'm looking for, and I don't see professionals. I see amateurs, I see trash, little pieces of trash on my stage. You guys are dummies. It's not even hard. You are dumb. It's not hard. Samantha's mean. Samantha gets to be mean because Samantha is a star, okay? Maybe one day you'll be a star, but right now you're not. You're junk. I have to go to the bathroom. You belong in the bathroom. Go! Let's take a five, let's take a break. I'm so upset. Are you okay? You're doing great. We'll be dressed very stylishly for the performance. It's going to be a great performance, Walter, very classy. I look forward to seeing it. Just make sure that the children are featured. That is who this is about. Yeah. Yeah it's about the kids. Absolutely, all about the kids, yeah. Absolutely, yeah, no, totally. Hey, Walter, you want to come sit with us? Yeah, come sit sith You lost him. Hello, everybody. He's all business, that guy, you know? He is all over us, man. We got to put on a good show, you guys, we got to. Hello. That was some pretty impressive work out there, Samantha. Excuse me, I'm eating my lunch. Well, don't get sassy with me. I'm trying to pay you a compliment. You know, I see a lot of myself in you. You're not like me. You're ugly. You don't-- that's not something you say. You're mean. You're the meanest girl in the world. Okay, you know what? You better thank your lucky stars I'm not in this competition because I would eat you for breakfast. You're driving me nuts. I don't like your hair. It's dumb. Your hair looks like it's dead. All right, that's it. You listen to me. All hair is technically dead, you stupid idiot smarty-pants stupid, stupid idiot. You better watch yourself, Samantha. Do you hear me? Because I am coming for you. Knock, knock. Who's there? Terrible breath. Wheezing. Dude, you're wheezing now. Slow down. Breathe and eat separately. This is what America is about, okay, being able to eat at any rate you want to eat. Shut, shut up. Stop making all of these things about America. You're fat not because of America Can we just change the conversation? Can we just focus on something else? Did you guys see the boy that's here? Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. I mean, what's that all about? I imagine Dad probably skipped town. Mom always wanted a daughter, so she sticks her little boy in the pageant, right, so she can play out her little fantasies about having a little girl. That kid does not want to be here, you know. A kid like this needs guidance. He needs real men showing him what it's Would you like to see my dance? Uh, yeah. Yeah. Sure.  I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy A Yankee Doodle, do or die A real live nephew. Of my Uncle Sam  I don't think this boy is being pushed into this at all. This is a boy who genuinely loves pageantry. Yeah. You know what? I bet he's never won one of these. We should help him win. Totally. For once let's let the boys in America win. Well, maybe we could make a few adjustments to the song, maybe update it a little bit. Yes, the song needs an update. All these old patriotic songs need updates. Yeah, they're like That's why nobody wants to listen to 'em.  I am The Yankee Doodle Boy.  Hey, all right, hey. All right, man. Good job, Benjamin. Hey, Justine. Hey. Hey, can we talk for just a quick sec? Yeah, I really need to do my homework, but Ah, I know, but I'm the adult and I said we were gonna talk, so that's what's gonna happen. Listen, I bet you wish you could win this pageant, don't you? My mom says I'm not pretty enough. Your mom doesn't know dick. She's a dumb, fat cow, and your sister-- she is a stupid little shit-mouthed bitch, isn't she? You just said a lot of bad words. Here's what's gonna happen, Justine, you are going to win this pageant. You are gonna win this pageant! And I am going to be the one who pushes you to do it. What do you think about that? Are you excited? Are you excited about that? Yeah, I don't really care about any of that. I know, but it's not what you care about, it's what I care about. Okay. Okay, ready? Oh, we got a lot of work to do. Screw this homework, right? Come on. So great to see you. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you so much. Thank you very Guys, Walter's here. He looks very pleased. Good, good, he should. I mean, this is like Yeah, yeah. Okay, good. I'm here. Oh. What on earth did you do to your face? I had it done at a funeral home. Why, why, why? Where in the hell am I going to go-- to the goddamn makeup counter at Macy's? You go to a funeral home to get gruesome repairs. Look. You look like you're at your own wake. Frank, Frank, I need some water. My mouth is dry. Your mouth is dry. Go into the toilet and run your mouth under the sink. Okay. Yeah, can I, could I, can I? I have a Who's that? He's the mortician. I invited him. Oh, you brought the mortician. Okay, well, that's not going to seem strange to anybody at all. I figure he's a cretin. Why would I have a cretin like that near me if I have something to hide? Hmm Associating with a man like that's not going to make you look any better. Hey, hey, hey, you're on in five. Oh, whoa.

Probably the kid. The kid definitely. Yeah. It felt uncomfortable. But at a rave, I feel like that would have been awesome. I know, but the kids make it weird. It did get a little weird. I can't figure this tie out here. I got a question about you morticians. You bang the dead bodies? Mm no. Imagine stuff like that goes on all time. I mean, I don't give a shit. If I was dead, you could bang me all you want. Who cares? Dead body's like a piece of trash. I mean, shove as much shit in there as you want Turn his mic down. I'm trying. I don't know I don't know how. You don't know how?! I don't know which one it is. Fill me up with cream. Turn me What's going on, you idiot? Make a stew out of my ass. What's the big deal? Bang me, eat me, grind me up into little pieces, throw me in the river. Who gives a shit? You're dead, you're dead. Ooh, shit. Is my mic on? Oh, God. Oh! Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. That was a mistake. The janitor got a hold of the P.A. system. Puerto Rican guy. You know, kids are great. I love the kids. Not in a sexual way. No, I was married 20 years, and she was a bitch, but she was old, and I never had a problem getting it up with her. What is this?! Get the girls! Well, well, well, wait. What. All right, all right, miss, could you, um, give me a little music, please? Play something nice. Play something. Play him out of here. Play some music, play some music. Yeah, okay, okay.  It's a grand old flag A high-fly  I don't this. I do not know this one. Come on, give me something like Walter, come up and help me and, uh, uh, help the people. Let's just leave. Yeah, let's go. Yeah, let's go, 'cause this is a bad Yeah, let's go. I just want you to be having a great time. Police. Oh, no. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Whoa. Oh, that's it. I'm done. I'm going away. Get your hands off me, pigs. Why are you taking Walter? Man's a diddler. Sick son of a bitch goes around all these kids pageants, pretends he's an inspector. We've been looking for him for a while. I'm just glad we finally got him off the street. You got your man. So, there's another unrelated diddler in the mix? Well, I mean, these things are just magnets for those people. It's like throwing a picnic at the beach and getting pissed when the seagulls show up. Yeah, you have to expect it. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Yeah, totally. I tell you, children's ' beauty pageants are an American tradition, but not a proud one. Nope. I'm gonna go. Me, too. Yeah. Let's go, let's go, because it still doesn't Wait! Wait! Who won? Uh, um, Samantha. She's the prettiest, right? Yeah. Come on. Yeah. Yay, I'm the winner!                       Hey, guys, why are the urinals filled with rocks? Oh, 'cause I put a bunch of rocks in 'em. Oh, okay, why? Well, you know how they were broken, so I was, like, filling them with ice. Now the ice machine's broken, so I'm just filling them up with rocks. You know that doesn't make any sense, right? Replacing the ice with rocks? The ice actually served a purpose Oh, oh, God! Oh, something just dripped in my mouth! Yeah, the ceiling is leaking. Oh, that's gross. What'd it taste like? What'd it taste like? Who gives a shit what it tasted like, Frank? Dude, what the hell? You have been docking our paychecks lately so that you could pay for shit like this around the bar. Why is nothing fixed? Yeah, by the way, I never agreed to let you dock my paycheck. That seems like something we should all vote on.
 It costs money to run this place and keep it main
 Hey-oh! What's up, bitches? What the shit is this? New scooter. My surrogate money came in. Oh, sweet. Where's our cut? Your cut? Whoa, hey, Mac makes a really good point. Yeah, we worked our asses off on that baby scheme of yours. Give us part of the money that you made. What the hell are you talking about? You did nothing for nine months. Get out. You couldn't have pulled something like that off without us. Yeah, they drove you to the hospital, they picked you up. I was there, I recall. Okay, I made all the contacts, I pushed that little monkey out and now I'm going to be claiming him as a dependent and getting tax breaks for the next 18 years. So you talk about a scheme? How's that for a long-term scheme, bitches? Uh, you guys all better eat a dick, 'cause Sweet Dee beat the system. Oh, no, no, no, lady. Sorry. Get out. Whatever god you're selling, I ain't buying it. Miss Reynolds, I'm with the IRS. We've been trying to contact you for months. Have you not received any of our letters? Letters? What is it, 1986? I don't do letters, lady. I'm all digital. Well, if you had opened up the letters you would understand that you're being audited. Audited? Why? What are you talking about? I'm not scamming the government, if that's what you're saying. Your license plate says "$CAMMIN." Uh, no. What do you mean no? Yes. Okay, I want to talk to you about this dependent that you're claiming-- this, uh, Barnabas Reynolds. Yes, I would love that. I would love that because I love to talk about little Barney, I do. But now's not a great time, you know what I mean? Because I left him in the car-- with the window down of course. It's hot. It's hot, isn't it? Well, is there a better time? Would 3:00 work? I can't wait for 3:00. Hey, Frank, we need to talk. We don't want you making any major bar decisions alone anymore. Because you're sleazy and we don't trust you. Yeah, we want to vote on things now, okay? We want a democracy. Well, that ain't gonna work. Because you guys get really emotional about everything. You'll start arguing about shit and nothing will get done. We know we're emotional people and we've discussed that. We think we have a solution. We're going to have a daily meeting where we will discuss all bar matters. Emotion will be suppressed and reason will prevail. Reason will prevail! Oh, yeah, we decided also that we would say "Reason will prevail," every time someone says Reason will prevail! You don't have to say it right now, because I'm just explaining to Frank that reason will prevail Reason will prevail! Again, you don't have to say it right now. I'm just explaining If we're going to say it, we're gonna say it every time. If you made up the rule Okay, I'll tell you what-- I like this. You do? Yeah. We should definitely do this to make everything fair. Everything aboveboard. Let's go do it in there. Come on. The first meeting of Paddy's congress shall commence henceforth. Oh, first order of business. Yeah? Let's talk about how Frank handles the money. Yes. Money, money, money, money, money, money Whoa, whoa. I know we got to talk about the money, but there are other issues that are pressing, too. Like what, dude? Like one that comes to mind is the dead dog. What dead dog? The dead dog in the alley. It's been there for about a week. Yeah, and we decided that Charlie was going to throw it in the trash. No, you decided that. We never got a vote. If Mac and I got to vote on that, we would have voted to, like, you know, have a proper dog burial. That's a waste of time and resources. Okay, well, hold on a second there, Frank. Let's put our new process into action. I think the guys should have a opportunity to state their case in a rational and unemotional way. Guys, you have the floor. Yeah. All right, sure. Easy. All right. No problem. Okay Uh, okay, sometimes dogs die. Right. Um, dogs, uh die from cars sometimes. Sometimes not. There's also Disease. There's also disease in America and abroad. Many dogs Goddamn it! I don't know how to express myself unless through anger and personal attack! I'm getting very upset, because I'm not saying it right! All right, guys, guys I want a dog funeral! Guys, calm down. I'm going to step in here and I'm gonna speak for you for a moment, if I may. I don't think it's a good idea for us to spend all of our hard-earned cash on some ornate display for the disposal of what amounts to an animal carcass. An animal that we never knew-- or had a relationship with. So I'm going to-- I'm going to go ahead and say that I think we should just throw it in a Dumpster. Come on! Oh But, but, but, we'll have a candle on site. We'll light it. We'll have a boom box there and you guys can say a few words. Huh. I don't love it. Me neither. But that dog is turning into hot soup out there in the sun. Okay. Frank? Fine. Okay! Hey, it works. Great. See, Frank, we can get through these issues and be unemotional about it. That's one issue off the docket right there. Next issue. Let's talk about the money. Money, okay Oh, yes, we're going to talk about the money, but we have a list of things on the docket here that we've got to check off. And if we're gonna do it right, we're gonna do it right. And the next thing on the list is limes and how we slice them. Thick or thin? Okay, let's talk about the limes, guys. We'll keep emotion out of it. Reason will prevail. Reason will prevail. Okay, I think the limes should be cut a bit thinner. What the hell?! Thin limes?! People will choke! People will die! Calm down. Charlie, Charlie, take emotion out of it. Charlie's got a point. One of the cornerstones of Paddy's Pub is thick limes. Yeah, don't tell me I'm going to put my thumb through your eye, you little bitch! No, no, no. Shh. Stay calm, stay Hey, hey, hey, look at me. Look at me, eh? Stay calm with me, okay? Be unemotional. Let's-Let's be democratic. Let's put this thing to a vote. A vote? A vote solves everything in a democracy, does it not? Yes. So, all for thinner limes, raise your hands. And all for thicker limes, raise your hands. Now, there you go. That's a democracy in action. That's two votes against two votes. A perfect example of when democracy has failed. Good news, Dee! We have decided to occasionally let you vote on some pressing matters in the bar as we see fit. What? Where do you land on thick limes or thin limes? And try and keep your emotions out of it even though people could choke and die. What are you talking about? What's, what's going on in here? Are you having another baby? No! No, it's fine, okay? I have it all under control. I just, I'm getting audited. Audited? Oh, she's screwed. That's the tax man? Yeah. I'm not screwed. I got it all under control, okay? I've got a handle on it. I just got to find a baby by 3:00 in the afternoon. Just get out. Just get out now. Hmm, a vote for thin limes would get me out of your apartment. Better yet, a vote for thick limes, I'll throw myself full force into this little baby caper of yours. I don't need your help. Look, Dee, you need our help, we need your help. Let's work something out here. I don't know which stance you're gonna do, and I don't wanna do it. Stop, stop standing like me. Okay, yeah, let's help each other out, okay? I got an idea. You guys go magically find me a baby by 3:00 in the afternoon, and then I'll-I'll help you out with your lime problem. Okay. Yeah. What? We can get you a baby. Yeah, you want, we'll get you a baby, no magic required. How many babies you need? Yeah. Just the one baby. How long? Couple hours? No, no. How long you need it for? You want it for life or you? Just a short-time baby. Just a short-time baby. Just a short-time baby? Easy. Oh, my God, you guys, this is so exciting! Oh, this is amazing! You have no idea how much you're helping me. Okay, let's see, um, all right, I tell you what. Here's how to handle your lime situation. It has been decided. We are now the Pickle Party. And Dee has joined us. We are going to vote for pickles in the bar instead of limes. What are you talking about? It doesn't matter. The point is, our three votes will always beat your two. We win, dude. We're the winners, okay? Give me a beer with a pickle in it. Well, what happens when you three disagree with each other? We're not going to disagree. That is the point of the Pickle Party, we're very aligned on these issues. Charlie, you can't just start your own party. You got to talk to people about Yes, you can. You can? If you're not as educated or as informed, what you do is you start your own party and you yell the loudest. We want attention! Okay, all right, yeah, sure. No, you're the Pickle Party. Great. Okay, so let's just accept that and move on. Yes, Frank, move on. Reason will prevail. Pickles will prevail! Okay, well, the next issue on our list should be a pretty easy one for the Pickle Party to agree on. "A crucifix in the bar." Ah, you are right, this is an easy one. Why wouldn't we have a crucifix in the bar? 'Cause we're a bar. Right, but we're an Irish Catholic bar. We're an Irish bar. Yeah, Irish Catholic bar, and therefore a giant wooden crucifix is a celebration or our heritage. Giant? Yeah. How big of a crucifix do you want? Big. It should be the centerpiece of the whole room. I mean, it should dominate every conversation. That's gonna be terrifying! It should be terrifying. That's how you know God loves you, Charlie. I don't want a giant bloody man in the bar scaring the customers, and most importantly, me! You see that, Frank? I saw it. I just played them like a fiddle. A goddamn fiddle. What do you want? I want in on the action. Whatever it is that you got going on around here, I want a piece of it, okay? You see, Frank, you might not know this, but you need me. People don't trust you, Frank. You're a piece of shit and you're ugly and you ooze sleaze and you're very, very ugly. All right, I'm gonna make you my puppet. Right here. Puppet. Look, I've been cooking the books in the bar for years. I faking knew it. I mean, all kinds of avenues and shell corporations. It's all fake and it's all in here. Let me see. Check it out right there. Oh, man, holy shit. What, what is this one? "Wolf Cola"? Wolf Cola, that's a bogus soda distributor. I made it up. It's fake! Look, the whole idea is the more corporations that you can plant offshore Right. the more money you can rake in. Da-da-da! I don't care about any of these details, but I like these figures I'm seeing. All right, I'll be the puppet and do my dance, and you can keep the goddamn details to yourself. Uh! I don't think I hear any arguing out there. So we can have the crucifix, but it needs to be in the back of the bar. See? I can live with that. That's a compromise right there, man. All right! Pickle Party compromise! Huh-huh-huh! Tasteful crucifix party. Hey-hey-hey, all right! Sounds like you guys came to a compromise. That's great. We cross the crucifix issue off the list. One quick question before I do, though. How bloody is this guy gonna be? Not bloody at all. Very bloody. What? He's gotta be drenched in blood. I mean, covered in blood. Why? Well, that's the whole point. You need to see the wounds of Christ. He needs to be ravaged. Oh, God, dude, it's bad enough I'm gonna let you put the stupid cross up in the first first place Stupid cross?! You son of a bitch, I knew it! I knew it! I knew it! Don't make fun! That's the whole point! Do it peaceful-like! It's a massacre! There's nothing peaceful. I don't want to look at a massacre! So, according to our records, you are claiming a dependent for which you have no official documentation. Yes? Are you okay? You're sweating profusely. Oh, no, yes, yes, I, um, I'm just very worried. You know, the babysitters were supposed to bring the baby back by 3:00, and where are you? Where are you guys? I understand. Crying baby! Crying baby here! Oh, my God. There's my sweet baby. Excuse me, won't you? Come on. Let's go. You guys, you found a baby! Where did you find a baby? Oh, you guys, I love you so much. Where? Okay, Dee, which crucifix do you find more tasteful? Are out of your goddamn minds? What is this? Where's the baby? Do you really want a kidnapping on top of all the other shit you got going on right now? We had a plan! We had a plan! She's totally buying it, okay? Come on. Make a decision. Yeah, but for how long? She could be out there for for hours. And I have to produce a real baby! Stop thinking about your problems and start thinking about our problems. Dee, calm down, calm down. You are so emotional right now. And so wet, too. Oh, my God, I'm gonna kill you. Okay, okay, just shut up for a second, let me think. All right, yes, go to the bar. That'll get me out of here and buy me some time to get this bitch off my balls. Bye! Very, very sick baby. Very sick baby! It's so sad when they don't feel well, isn't it? Lock up, won't you, on your way out? And let's definitely reschedule. Let's do. Shh! Hey, yeah, so I was thinking about my title, because I think it should be "Vice President of Worldwide Disibution." But you don't need a title. What I need you to do for the next three weeks is to deflect Mac and Charlie. That's easy. I can do that, Frank. That's what I'm good at. But I am gonna need a business card, 'cause I want to be able to hand that shit to people, so they know that I am in a place of power. It's not important. It's important to me, Frank! And I know that what's important to you is money and power, but I want real power, because with real power comes real responsibility, and I don't want any of that shit. I just want the money. And the illusion of power. And puss. What? Hell, I don't know, Frank. I don't know, man. What? Tell me, tell me. I need something. I mean, I got this, uh this giant gaping hole inside me. Oh. And I'm-I'm always trying to fill it with something. I like to call it my, uh, my God hole. Oh. And I think a lot of people in this world, they-they fill it with religion. But I don't believe in God. But you want to fill it with pussy. Yeah. Yo! Hey, Dennis and Frank, you here? Yeah, oh, oh! Good. Guys, we got to help Dee with her tax audit situation. So, Dennis, please, if you could take the floor. W-Wait, wait. What tax audit situation? Oh, right. Okay, so Dee's baby scheme blew up in her face and now she's getting audited. Deandra, did you tell the IRS you work here? Of course I did. We can't have the IRS looking around our books. Why? What's wrong with our books? Let me step in here. Um, I think what you're trying to say is that the IRS poking around our bar business is no good for anyone. Look, it's gonna be best for all of us to get the IRS off of Dee's back. Okay. So, as the only rational and emotionless person here, I'm gonna tell you guys what we need to do. See, you've all been trying to convince the IRS that Dee's baby is alive. What you really need to be doing is convincing the IRS that Dee's baby is dead. This is dark. Darkest thing we've ever done. Mm-hmm. Oh. Hello. I'm looking for Dee Reynolds. Yes. Won't you have a seat please? What's going on? Baby croaked. Oh, yes. Oh, my God. This is insane, right? Mm-hmm. I mean, this definitely feels like emotion trumping reason, correct? Yep. Also, dude, I'm sorry, but is this the size you had in mind? Yes. It's too big. It's not too big. You should just be happy I didn't spray it down yet. No, you're not getting any more blood. That's it. "He was my sweet angel" All right, Dee, here we go. It's showtime. Are you ready? Okay, I have a couple questions. Yeah? I'm getting nervous, Dennis, 'cause I don't think I can do the speech that you wrote. Let me hear some of it. Okay, and this is the thing, I-I can't, I can't cry on command. Jesus Christ, Dee. I mean, how are you planning on becoming an actress at all? You can't make people laugh, 'cause you're not funny, you can't cry on command. What can you do? I-I can try harder, but it's just that All right, well, the good news is I anticipated this, so I brought What's that? a bit of chili powder. I'm gonna blow this directly into your eyes, and trust me, you'll cry. Okay, is that safe though? Is this? Well, it's, you know, it's safe enough. Let's give it a try, shall we? No, no, no, no, no, no! Shh-shh-shh. Oh, shit! Oh! Shh-shh-shh. Okay, listen, listen, listen. Save it, save it! We're starting. Ready? We're starting, Dee. Break a leg. Oh. It's really heavy. What did Frank put in there? The urinal rocks. Oh. Coming in handy, huh? Yeah. Oh, this is a very sad day for the entire Paddy's Pub family. Mm-hmm. At times like this, I-I like to quench my thirst with a delicious Wolf Cola. There's nothing like that to wash away the sorrow. Hear, hear. That's my bit. Now it's time for the grieving mother. Uh oh. Hello, everyone. Ah, God. Thank you so much for coming. It's such a sad day, isn't it? Oh, little Barney. You were my special angel. And only angels can fly. Good God. Sorry. Sob. Sob, you bitch. Oh, it hurts! God, it hurts! The pain inside. God, it hurts so bad. Okay. Oh, my God, I'm sorry. That's enough. Okay, Dee. I'm sorry, I just Are my eyes bleeding? Oh, my God, is there blood? Okay. Oh! Is there blood?! You son of a bitch! Wow. Heavy stuff, guys. Heavy stuff, heavy subject matter. Anyway, uh, Barney, you died too young. Before you could walk. Before you could talk. And before you had the chance to get together the proper paperwork, all that paperwork that you need to prove-- Oh, thank you so much. Wolf Cola, everyone. It's the right cola for closure. Let's talk about closure, 'cause that Can I talk to you for a second? Yeah. Dude, something stinks. I know, I know. Have you noticed that all we wanted to do was talk about our money Right. and then we kept getting pushed into talking about other things? And then when we leave, Frank and Dennis became all buddy-buddy. Yeah, there were a lot of backroom dealings going on in here, you know? What the hell is this? "Dennis Reynolds, Executive Vice President of Worldwide Distribution. Wolf Cola." What the hell, dude? See, now I'm getting pissed off, you know, 'cause I think those two are conspiring against us. Let's go out there and expose these sons of bitches for who they are. And the most important thing to remember is that this whole thing is over, right? Dead. Every single person in this room has to move on. That's excellent. Excellent, Dennis. Thank you, thank you. Now, we would like to pay our respects to the dead baby. And in the Christian tradition, we're gonna open up the casket to take one last look at his tiny corpse. You don't want to do that. What is happening? This is what you get when you mess with the Pickle Party. Pickle Party. Prepare for your hearts to turn to stones! God. What the hell is that?! It's the dead dog from the alleyway. I was compromising. I figured we'd give it a proper burial. Okay. Well, I'm done here. Well, I'll tell you what. Dee's definitely going down in this audit. I think we're all going down, Charlie. Okay, you know what, here-- let's vote on something once and for all. Everybody in favor of Frank not making all of the decisions in the bar anymore, raise your hands. Great, that's settled. Even he's on board. Okay, and finally, all in favor of going back to the old system of organized chaos, where emotion trumps reason every single time and we just yell at each other to get the shit that we want, raise your hands. Fantastic! I've got a few things I'd like to yell about now, so we can all start. My eyes! My eyes! You opened the casket!                        DENNIS: Well, okay, what would you do, Dee? SWEET DEE: I'm saying that if I were a cop, I would have an Uzi. Well, but I'm saying that the police force would never issue you an Uzi, so now what? CHARLIE: That's not her point, though. That's not what we're talking about, that's not my Thank you, Charlie. Listen, if you had the choice, would you choose to carry one gun that shoots one bullet or would you choose to carry an Uzi-- one gun that shoots a thousand bullets in one second? Yeah, you're shooting bullets everywhere. FRANK: I agree with her 100%.
 Right?
 I mean, she's absolutely right. Got people coming at you from every angle. Frank, honestly, if you're going to join in the conversation, will you swallow your food and then speak? It's disgusting. MAC: Yeah, hey, Frank, what are you eating over there? A hoagie. You are not eating a hoagie. You are just jamming meats and cheeses inside of your mouth. I like to make it in my mouth. It tastes better. Frankie? Gino? You piece of shit! GINO: You son of a bitch! (both grunting) I'll kill you, I'll kill you, I'll kill you! Now, this is interesting. Yeah. Yeah. Now, do we break this up? No, no, n-no, d-don't break it up. I want to see how this whole thing plays out. (grunting continues) Oh! Okay, well, that seemed to settle it. Yep. Okay, all right, okay, all right. Jesus Christ, Frank, who the hell is this man? My goddamn brother. (Frank growls) Frank, I had no idea you had a brother. Yeah, what gives, Frank? You told us your brother was dead. Yeah, you said that he had his guts sucked out of his asshole through a hot tub drain. You told that to my own niece and nephew? Uh, well, technically, sir, he's not our father, which would mean you're not our uncle. Yeah, we thought he was for a long time, and then as it turns out You know what? It's a whole thing, so Yeah, let's not get into it. How could you do this to me, Frankie? Do what, Gino? You know what I'm talking about. You're trying to steal her from me. She's my woman. You stole her from me first. Well, you stole her back. Whoa, whoa, whoa, who the hell are you guys talking about? BOTH: The love of my life. Well, this just got more interesting. I'm gonna pull up a seat and get into it. This just got very interesting, Frank. Why don't you walk us through this? No, I'm not dragging this shit up again. This is ancient history. No, no, no, I think they need to hear this. I think they need to hear what a liar and a cheat their father is. Let me start at the beginning. It was back in the '60s. I'm gonna jump in for a second 'cause it sounds like you're about to launch into a whole thing. Is it going to take a long time? My attention span is very short. That's a valid concern. It'll take as long as it takes. Ah okay. Well, we might pop in and out mentally. Yeah, you know, our generation-- it's like Yeah, you want to make it funny or something? Give it some flair. Okay, it was in the '60s. (jazz playing) If you were looking for me, you'd find me at a happening little jazz club on the north side of town. It was an all-black joint. Blacks played the best music. Not that I gave a shit-- I got a tin ear. It all sounded like a bunch of noise to me. See, I was running numbers as a bookie for the club. I'd take bets for the owner Reggie. REGGIE: Yo, Gino. He had a temper. He also had a weakness for betting horses and a strength for losing those bets. You see, Reggie owed me money, and when he came up short, I called in a favor. I need you to hire someone. I ain't hiring another one of your bimbos, Gino. This bimbo is my little brother. He's here every night for the music. He's more Negro-ish than anybody else in this club. Frankie. Gino. (Frank humming) How would you like to work here? Would I ever? I love the music, sir. He's just a kid. How old are you, boy? Nineteen. Shit, you don't look a day over 12. I'll do anything. I was looking out for my younger brother. I was keeping him out of trouble. I got Frankie a job and he loved it. That was a shit job. I was mopping up puke, I was busing tables and washing dishes. It stunk.  So far, so good  But at least I had that sweet music to keep me going.  So far, so good  And then one night I heard the voice of an angel. No, not her.  So far, so good   So far, so good  Keep going.  I thought by now You would be long gone  That's her.  So far, so good  Boy, she was the cat's meow. That was Shadynasty. Got to stop you. Good time to stop. Okay, so The love of your life was a black woman named Shadynasty? Yeah. So what's wrong with that? Well, th-th-there's nothing wrong with it. Lots of things. It's strange, it's strange. It's just unexpected. Yeah, that's strange. Shadynasty. Well, go on, though. All right. All right, so it was late one night, I was cleaning up, doing my usual routine. (glass shattering) Are you out of your goddamn mind? SHADYNASTY: I saw you with her. Bitch, if I want to be with another woman, I'll be with another woman. Hey, hey, hey, relax. (overlapping shouting) Relax, relax, be cool, daddy-o, be cool. Gino, get this bitch out of my sight. You just be cool, man, don't blow your top. Breaking my dishes, bitch, goddamn. Hey, Frankie here is gonna take you home and I'm gonna talk to Reggie. He old enough to drive? Sure. For a while, we drove in silence until I finally got the nerve to speak to her. You got a huge set on you. Excuse me? Pipes-- you got a great voice. Oh, thank you. You like black music? Do I? I'm gonna open a jazz joint of my own someday-- an integrated place where blacks and whites can get along. No Orientals, though. You got to have a dream, I guess. And you're going to be my star attraction. Child, I ain't nothing but a backup singer. Oh, no, you're the real, true star, Shadynasty. You just need a sky to shine in. If I didn't know better, I'd think you were flirting with me. White man. Get down. Whoa, why were you shoving her head down? You did not want to be caught out in the street in those days with a Negress. They'd tear you apart. Negress? What? Whatever the proper word was. Well, it's not that, it's a different word. It wasn't that. We're talking '60s terms. Okay. Okay. Okay, you used those terms. You shouldn't have. Did you open the club or what? You bet your ass I did. With hard work and perseverance. Bullshit. We opened the club with my gambling money. And that's when we became business partners. The point is, we opened the club, and we named it after our star attraction. Shady-nasty's? Shadynasty's, asshole. Whatever. He's out of here. Is that how you spell it? So business was booming.  Like fire needs the air to breathe  Shadynasty was a star.  Desire's coming over me I wanna please you, babe  And every night, it seemed like she was singing to me.  Oh sometimes it gets me  'Cause she was. Frankie's dreams were coming true. Mmm But sometimes dreams come at a price. Well, well, well. Ain't this some shit. Hi, Reggie. How you doing? Not good, Frankie. No? I gave you everything. Then you go and take my best bitch. I'm not anyone's bitch. I left you, Reggie. I'm with Frank now. Oh, you with her now, huh? Yeah. I guess that don't leave me with no choice but to be a mature-ass adult about this shit. I'm working on my temper. But know.. that I strongly disagree with this! She's your problem now. Good luck, Frankie. Gino, what are you doing? Saving your life. Run, Frankie. (siren wailing) No, don't The police carted off me and Reggie. I got two years in the slammer and Reggie got six. Wait. Why did Reggie get more years than you? You beat the man half to death. He was black. Those were the days. You sound like you yearn for those days, Frank. No. I'm just saying those were the days. Huh. Mm-hmm. Okay. Anyway, by the time I got out of prison, the '70s had arrived.  I was searching for someone to love me Hold me close and put no one above me  Ah, bro, so good to have you back. My brother. I missed you, Frankie. I really missed you. Oh, I missed What the shit is that? A little bump of coke. Since when do you do drugs? Prison. It's the '70s, Frank. Everybody does drugs. Gino, Gino, Gino, Gino, not, not not in my club. No, no, no. No, drugs are trouble. I don't want no trouble. Relax. I got a gun for protection. Wait! What are you doing with that gun?! You take a gun out? No drugs, no guns No trouble. Hey, I could eat. Give me something. Help yourself. Make a sandwich in your mouth. It tastes really good. I know how to do it. I'm the one who taught you to do it! Oh, God. This is insufferable. Oh, my Please, just continue. I just wanted to make an honest woman of Shadynasty. Settle down, start a life together. I was building up the nerve to ask her. I want those peas. Let me see that. Okay, all right While I was busting my ass running the club, saving money wherever I could, Gino was just having one big party. (cheering) No, no, I never danced with no guys. Maybe you did, maybe you didn't. No-no, no-no-no-no. I'm going to tell you how it went. First off, I was banging babes left and right, left and right. (moaning) (sighing) But my past came back to bite me. Get lost, bimbo. Gino. Reggie, you're out of prison. It ain't Reggie no more. It's Hakim Mohamed. What's with the getup? Prison changed me. I'm a Black Panther now. We strong black men; we don't take kindly to you slingin' dope in our hood, you dig? Are you threatening me? You bet your ass I am. But maybe this will change your mind. (gunshot) Ah, shit. It's a goddamn petition! What the hell?! I thought he was pulling a gun. All right, I'm going to take care of this, Frankie. You got to disappear for a while. Disappear? Where am I going to disappear to? We're going to get you to South America. I got connections. South America? What about Shadynasty? I'm gonna look after Shadynasty. Frankie! Shadynasty! Frankie! No! Shadynasty! (sobbing) That's when I started my new life. Colombia. What a dump. Gino scored me a job all right. I was quality control for his Colombian cocaine connection. I'd become everything I hated. The only thing that kept me going was writing letters to Shadynasty. I wrote her every night. But I never heard back. (echoing): Shadynasty! I occupied my mind immersing myself in the culture. Taking in the cuisine. But mostly doing cocaine. (snorting) (yelling) Ah! That part was a blast actually. (yelling) Weeks turned into months, and months turned into years. (yelling) But I had to wean myself off. I was living life just going through the motions. I knew I had to get back home. (woman moaning) Back to Shadynasty. Yes! You shouldn't be calling. It's too risky. The little birdie wants to fly back to the cage. It's too close to the stove. There's too much heat. The little birdie can stand the heat. He wants to migrate home. The little birdie can't come home on account of the attempted murder! Why'd you say that, Gino?! You used my name. I'm going to hang up now. And don't come home, Frankie. Now you used my name! (sputtering) (dial tone droning)  Please don't talk about being true  I had to get back. So I snuck into the States. And what I saw when I got home made me sick.  Please don't talk about all the plans we had  What was once a clean, respectable jazz club had turned into a drug-filled disco shithole.  I want some action I want to live!  And that's when I saw my brother.  I want to give it I want to get some, too  With Shadynasty. (retching)  I love the nightlife I've got to boogie On the disco round, oh, yeah Oh, I love the nightlife  I'm sorry to bust up your party! What? I said I'm sorry to bust up your party. What are you doing here? I was homesick. But now I'm just regular sick. Why?! You were gone! He was here! What? She said that you were gone, and I was here. Oh, to get you hooked on drugs? Shadynasty, you have a choice. You can live a life with me, or you can live a life with him, and with drugs. What's it going to be? Drugs. Huh? I choose drugs. Drugs? Drugs! She said drugs. You know, it's the way things go in the world. You understand. You son of a bitch! Frankie, no You son of a bitch! Stop it! Stop it! (yelling) You bald son of a bitch! I was bald before you were bald. You son of a bitch! (all yelling) Break it up. You could have had any girl you wanted. She was my one and only. You stole her from me. You're stealing her from me. I found the new love letters you've been writing to her, Frankie. Talking about meeting up again and running away. What are you talking about? I haven't written to her in years. Bullshit! They're all signed, "Love, your one and only." I should have destroyed these, like I destroyed the letters from Colombia. What? You destroyed the letters I wrote to Shadynasty? I intercepted and I read every one of them. They were poetry. Each one was more beautiful than the last. Too beautiful, though. I couldn't let Shadynasty read them. Not if she was going to stay with me. But these letters-- these are smut. "I want to be in you. My dick is a raging bull for you." And this one, here, "Meet me at the airport, Friday, at 5:00, Terminal C. Love, your one and only." You are trying to steal her from me, Frankie, and I ain't gonna let you. Gino, Gino. That's not me. I'm telling you, I never wrote those. What? I'm putting something together here. She's at the airport right now meeting some dude. So, like, if you want to try and get her back, you got to move. Guys, it's almost 5:00. Now I'd like to see this whole story play out. It's appealing to the romantic in me. I feel like I want to see it. Come on, man. Let's go to the airport. Let's do it. All right, go. This is the gate. I don't see a black woman anywhere. No. I mean, there's her, but That's her! What? Really? That is not at all what I was picturing. No. No, right? Shadynasty. Frankie! Oh, my word! Oh, you're still as beautiful as ever. What are you doing here? Oh, you know, I wrote to you every single day from South America. I mean, I really feel like we could still be together. There's still a chance for us. Shadynasty, I'm sorry for whatever I did. Please, don't go. Don't choose Gino, choose me. No, no, no, you choose me. I have loved you all my life. No, pick me. No. Our love was strong. We were together. Pick me, pick me. Pick me, Shadynasty. I'm sorry, but I pick him. Ain't this some shit. Reggie. Reggie? Whoa, everyone's a lot fatter than I was expecting them to be. Yeah. Last time I saw you, Frankie, you had me sent to jail. But I forgive you. That's all in the past. Reggie is your one and only, huh? He was all along. But because of you two, he was always in jail. I could never be with him. Excuse me, Mr. Mohamed? Yeah? Your name came up on a no-fly list. I need you to come with us. Oh, hell no. I'm supposed to be getting on this flight. Sir, please cooperate. Listen, I'm getting on that plane with Shadynasty. That's it. Let's take him down. Wait! Oh, hell no! Times have changed! It can't still be like this! Leave him be. Reggie?! No! Did you call that in? No, that just happened. Oh Guess times kind of haven't changed much, huh? If I'm being honest, she looked like shit. Mm. Yeah. She did not age well at all. No. Did she ever look good? She was never attractive. I guess black can crack. That's still still kind of racist. Yeah, that's racist. Is anybody hungry? Yeah, I'm hungry. I'm starving. Well, let's go eat. Hey, did Frankie ever tell you about the time that I threw him off the John Wanamaker Building? You son of a bitch. He told us about that. I can't-- I can't listen to another goddamn story. I don't want to hear that story.                      We are looking at one of the most powerful storm systems ever to hit the Philadelphia area, folks. As the hurricane moves up the East Coast, we're already starting to feel its impact with heavy winds, and everyone is bracing themselves for torrential rainfall. Oh, my God. I've never seen anything of this magnitude. I can't believe how severe this is. They get bigger and bigger every year. We're expecting Philadelphia, this is dangerous. Stay indoors and be safe. Well, I, for one, would like to meet this Jackie Denardo and see if her breasts are as staggering in person. Guys, maybe we should get a 3-D TV. The breasts are only going to keep getting bigger, and we need the latest technology to keep up. Are you guys kidding me? You're focused on boobies at a time when a massive storm is about to hit Philadelphia? It's a hurricane we're talking about. Oh, she's talking about it and, you know, we're sort of listening and we're enjoying her breasts. Just let us have this. The breasts make you care about the weather in a really good way, not Guys, maybe she's right. I mean, maybe we are too focused on this woman's breasts. Switch it to the other news channel. Amigos, tenemos Ho! Whoo! Cha, cha, cha. Oh, man, it's internacional. It's on every channel. These are the breasts we should focus on. Hello, 'sup? 'Sup? 'Sup? 'Sup? What are you wearing? Oh, I got all riled up by the weather report and ain't a drop of rain out there, so I put this old trash bag on to keep myself protected. Yeah, you did it for nothing, huh? Yeah, it's media hype hyping up the storm, making people all nervous about it. I don't know, Frank, I don't think this is hype 'cause they're calling it the storm of the century. Well, I'll tell you what, Dee, um, because you might be right, I think it's worth switching over to the other channel because I feel like the coverage was a little bit more extensive. As you can see behind me Ho, look at that! Oh, come on! Yeah. I'm broadcasting to you live from the All American Home Center where shoppers are facing long lines to buy supplies for the hurricane expected They're talking about evacuating the city. Guys, maybe this is more serious than we thought. Yeah, it's serious, it's a category five storm. We've got to get ready. Oh, shit. Dude, maybe the Mexicans were right. What are you talking about? The Mexicans predicted that the world was going to end in 2012. That was the Mayans, dude. Mayans, Mexicans-- what's the difference? One difference is that the Mayans are extinct. Yeah, the Mexicans killed the Mayans. No, the Spaniards banged the Mayans, turned 'em into Mexicans. Oh, guys, this doesn't look good. Okay, we're now getting unconfirmed reports of sporadic looting in cities along the East Coast. People are looting now? Come on. Ah, it's the media. They hype the storm, they hype the looting. It's all for ratings. Whatever. Either way, I think we should head up to higher ground, you know, go to the Poconos. No, you don't want to go up in the mountains. Are you crazy? That's just putting you closer to the storm. You want to go low, low as can be. All right, you know what? We got to stop pussydicking around here, okay? It's time to get in the bunker. Bunker, what bunker? Yeah, we, uh, we converted this old storage closet into a place where we could ride out Y2K. Ha, Y2K-- perfect example of how the press hypes everything to no end and nothing happens. Well, we know that now, Frank, but back then we were pretty scared. Yeah, but why were we so scared? Well, Dee got us all worked up about the computers taking over mankind and then she had us build this bunker. Yeah, robopocalypse-- machines communicating with each other and conspiring to destroy the human race. That is complete nonsense, Deandra. Is it nonsense? Is it nonsense, or is it nonsense that we rely solely on computers to run every aspect of our lives, huh? Hysterical, she's hysterical. Calm down, Dee. Here, come check out the bunker. It's pretty cool. What the hell? What the hell happened to the bunker? We, uh, we raided the bunker directly after Y2K. Well, now it's empty, now there's nothing in here for us to use. And why is there a condom wrapper on the floor? Uh, you've probably been banging in the bunker, right? Guilty. I've been watching him bang in here. Have you? Weird, weird. The bunker is for emergencies. This is not a joke. Yeah, well, whatever, you know. Yeah, that's an emergency, I guess. I see that somebody's also been eating a lot of your weird canned foods and sardines, Charlie. Yeah, where's all my? Yeah, well, he was probably down here with Mac, watching you rape girls and eating pickled eggs. I don't rape girls, come on. Yeah, and I don't eat that many pickled eggs, but Well, you know what? Let's stock up on some more pickled eggs down here, though. That's a good idea. Let's go to the All American Home store. We can get all of our supplies there. The All American? Yeah. That's the place with the weather Yeah. Let's go there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's go there. Wait, you're gonna actually go where the media is advertising? Oh, come on, Frank, it's not like we've never been to the All American Home Center before. It's in our minds, you know, and she's in my mind. Let's go there, it's settled. Right, I know, but first we need to board up windows, so, Frank, you help me with this plywood and you guys can each grab a box over there and then we'll And they have left, they have left now. I'm only still here 'cause I'm not as quick as them. Is that a pickled egg? No, it's an egg I brought from home. Attention, all All American Home Center shoppers People seem pretty amped up. We should get our supplies before they sell out. Yeah, for sure, you know, we should come up with a plan and we should divide up. Oh, my God. Oh, they're spectacular. Imagine that image in 3-D. Oh, baby. Yeah, my God. Guys, I'm telling you, we should get one of these 3-D TVs. Yeah, totally, but not now, okay? We can't spend our money on a 3-D TV. Right, right, all right, we got to get the supplies, head up to the Poconos ASAP. Come on. I don't know, I mean, let's think about this. I mean, for all we know, it could be the end of days. No, it's not the end of days. I don't want to go uphill. Guys, it's not the end of days. Calm down, it's just a storm, okay? We-We'll get some batteries, we'll get some supplies. Food, we'll get food. Yeah, we'll get food. Okay, but I feel like you did-- you didn't say food. Yeah, we'll get food, okay? Jesus Christ. Relax. Okay, yeah, I'm, I'm getting crazy. All right, I'll get the food. Yeah-- oh, my God. You guys get the supplies. Okay, we'll get the supplies. Okay. Okay, give us the cash because No, no, it's-- I have Frank's credit card. You take the cash. You got the cash, we got the credit card, let's go. Hey, you know what I was thinking? In addition to supplies, might be nice to grab some girls, you know, get them back to the bar. This Jackie Denardo chick-- she's, uh, sparked another storm inside me if you know what I mean. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Might be nice to ride the storm out with some chicks. Yeah, yeah, and we could use 'em to repopulate the planet or something. That'll be great to have them. I'm not going to entertain this notion anymore. I don't want to hear it. Okay, I'd at least like to find one, like, Mexican or Mayan or something for predictions. No, but get some batteries, though. You be the battery guy and I'll be the, the chicks and tits guy. All right. Frank! Frank, you want to come help me do this or what? No, come over here. I want you to see this. Frank Come on, check this out. At any moment, hoards of maniacs could come pouring through the windows. This doesn't concern you? Come on, Deandra. Please come over here and sit down, look at this. Oh! What? You remember years ago there was a storm in New Orleans? Hurricane Katrina?
 Yes.
 Yeah, I remember it. Mm-hmm. Okay, check this out. What do you think those people are doing, surviving or looting? They're surviving. Ah. Okay. Do you remember a man named Rodney King? Yes, of course I do. Okay, the LAPD worked him over really good. Yes. Okay. This was taken during the Rodney King riots. What do you think these people are doing, looting or surviving? Well, they're looting. Ah, of course. Well, it's the media, see? When it's white people, it's survival, and when it's black people, it's looting. No, Frank, it's because the white people are stealing bread, and the black people are stealing speakers. If the white people were stealing stereo equipment, I would say they were looting, too. How do you know the blacks don't have bread in those speakers? What are you talking about? What are we talking about right now? There are big things to do. Oh, okay, all right, listen, listen, listen, okay, calm down. This is the best part. More? Oh, yeah, just check this out. This was taken during the riots. Do you recognize anybody in there? What are you doing in the video? I happened to be out in L.A. during the riots. I was on business. And to steal ski equipment, I guess. Yeah, well, I went in for a loaf of bread, I took some skis. Everybody's happy. Not the people who own the skis. Oh, shit. All right, all right, calm Oh, my God, the power went out! Calm down. This is terrible! We got to get at Jesus! Goddamn it. That's why I like to have this little baby with me. Come on. I'm go All right, let's go to the bunker bunker. You come with me. Yeah, go first. Don't. Just be careful with that. We're gonna call it a hurricane party. It's gonna be cool. It's gonna be awesome, yeah. What's a hurricane party? A hurricane party's exactly what it sounds like. It's a party during a hurricane at our bar, Paddy's Pub. Oh, I've heard of that bar. Yeah? Hey!  Hello! All right, all right! Hi. Crazy, crazy weather coming our way. Yeah. Yeah. You trying to get these girls down to the bunker, or? Oh, no, I'm inviting them back to our very cool bar we own. Oh, cool, cool. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, we got a sweet bunker, too. Yeah, well It's, like, so secure, people can't get in or out if we don't want 'em to. We'll be, like, totally safe down there. Yeah. I got a bunch of supplies. You guys like pickled eggs? Sardines, too Yeah, we got a bunch of other, you know, normal food and normal stuff there, too. Yeah. Yeah, it's a great bar. Gonna be free drinks for everybody, so you know, you'll come, you'll party with us, and you can bring your girlfriends, too, you know? Sure. We don't want just the two of you. You got to bring your girlfriends. That's a requirement. Sounds like fun. Can our boyfriends come, too? Oh. Your boyfriends? Yeah, our boyfriends. You two have boyfriends? How did you not know that the reason I invited you back to my bar was to bang you? Get out of here! Get the hell out of here! Get Get out of here! Shoo away from me! You're a dick. You're a dick. She's a I'm not a dick. Oh! It's okay. Take it easy, all right? What was that? That was too dark. They lied to me. Oh, okay, well, just let it go, all right? If you want to entice these ladies, you got to talk about the bunker, you got to lead with the bunker No. You end with the bunker, or you don't talk about the bunker at all. Are you kidding me? What are you wearing? Dude, they have amazing stuff here. I'm totally prepared. Check this out. How sweet is that? Dude No, drop the Are you kidding me? You think girls are gonna want to come back to a bar with a man dressed the way you're dressed and carrying a hatchet? Yeah. They're gonna be, like, "Look at this sweet dude, his awesome gear and his awesome hatchet. He's prepared, he's ready for anything. Storm coming? Hatchet coming." Dude, I have an idea. I'm gonna go to the office section. Meet me in the office section. Okay. All right, good. I'll find Mac, 'cause we got to get out of here, man. Okay, yeah, no, no. Um, let's loose the hatchet. Come on, man. The I got another hatchet. Don't you worry about that. Dark as shit in here. It's very creepy. Let's just get to the bunker. What was that? Was that a rat? It was a looter. Loot Behind us. Oh, a looter! Looter! Shoot him! No, don't shoot! It's Cricket! Ooh, no! Cricket. Oh, what are you doing down here, Cricket? I come down the bunker sometimes when it rains. Oh, we got to get him to the hospital. No, I ain't going to no hospital. They euthanize the homeless. They're goddamned death mps! You got no hand, Cricket. I have a hand, Frank. It's-It's a little I have a hole in it. Big deal. Oh, Frank, I'm gonna be honest with you. I don't really want to go to the hospital, either, you know, because we're gonna be there when the hurricane hits, and it's gonna be packed to the gills with vagrants. Are you out of your mind?! This man is bleeding to death here. Well, okay, oh, you know what we could do? We could dress him up and take him upstairs, and then the looters would think he's the owner of the bar, and they'd have their way with him, and if he died, you know, it's on them, and-and not on us. That-That's good. Let's just do that. Don't listen to him! He's delirious! You're bleeding out, Cricket! It's nothing Frank, this is nothing. Goddamn it! All right, Cricket, all right, fine, we'll go, we'll go to the hospital. Frank, we are coming right back here after we drop him off, to be where we are safe in the bunker where we belong, okay? Let's go! Okay, get out. You're marching me to the ovens. Dennis! There you are, dude. Dude, things are getting kind of bad in here, man. Like, people are all worked up, right? I'm been trying to find Mac. He's not answering my phone calls. I went out to the parking lot to see if he was out there hiding out in the car or something. He took off! Car's gone! Mm, well, clearly, he's evacuated to the Poconos. Do you really think he'd do that to us? Absolutely do that to us. I don't know. This is bad, dude. What you got here? What you working on? Oh, uh, this is great. This is an agreement for the women. Oh. Yeah, it guarantees that whoever comes back to the bar with us agrees to follow all the rules that we set forth. Well, that's smart. Walk me through the details. What you got, Dennis? Uh, it's all very simple, Charlie, very simple stuff. Um, "I state your name" Charlie Kelly. Hmm? Well, not your name. Oh. Their name. "Being of sound mind and body, do solemnly pledge that I do not have a boyfriend. Nor am I currently engaged in a sexual relationship with another individual, females excluded." Right. "I hereby agree to be easygoing, to engage in playful conversation, to always act as though I desire your penis even when I don't." Yeah? And it sort of goes on and on like that for a while. I love it. Where do I sign? Okay, again, um, you don't sign anywhere. If we're doing a contract, I want to sign it, so This isn't a contract for you, Charlie. Uh, it's not? This is a contract  Till now I always got by on my own I never really cared  Until I met you And now it chills me to the bone How do I get you alone?  Oh, my God. Charlie, I might be in love with this woman-- not for the right reasons, mind you. I got an idea. Yeah. Let's get her back to the bunker, right? She's the perfect kind of woman to start over the new world with. We would create a race of super giant-breasted women, you know? I'd start sleeping with your daughters, you'd sleep with my daughters, I'd sleep with your daughters' daughters, you'd sleep with my daughters' daughters. We die, our sons would sleep with our daughters' daughters' daughters. It's like a perfect society. Okay, I see where you're going with that, but it sounds like it could get a little messy. It could get a little stick let's work out a new agreement, you know All right, we'll come up with a separate agreement. Who sleeps with whose daughter? Okay, that sounds good. Um, all right, I'm gonna go talk to this woman, you know? All right, okay, okay. All right. Um I got to say, man, this woman's, like, really throwing me off, dude, I feel very, very nervous. I don't usually get nervous. You want me to help you out? Yeah no. I'll go over there with you. No, no, no, I want you to stay as far away from me as possible. You're standing too close to me as it is, actually. Have you gotten into the cheese? There's a whole cheese section. I bet there is. I went nuts. All right, well, you stink. Mm-hmm, all right, you know what? I'll find Frank, he'll pick us up. Okay, yeah, go call Frank. I'm gonna go talk to the, uh I don't think I can do it dressed like this, though. I look ridiculous. You guys, I don't mean to be a bother, but are we almost at the hospital? Shut the hell up, Cricket! Okay, I'm driving as fast as I can! Do you not see that?! Move! What are you doing, Frank? What are you doing, Frank? I'm getting air. You're sucking it all up with your panicking. It's freezing outside. You're gonna catch cold and then everyone's going to get sick in the bunker. What are you talking about, freezing? It's sunny as shit. Will you calm down, for crying out loud? You're gonna give me a heart attack. Oh, all right. Let's go. It's Charlie. Yo. You're shitting me. Huh? God. Mac went to the Poconos, left them stranded by the All American with the supplies. With the supplies? No, n-n-n-no, I'm not getting stranded in the bunker with no supplies. You guys, what about me? I'm in pain, I'm in Goddamn you, Cricket, goddamn you, it's not about you! Listen, I'm gonna pick up the guys, then I'll drop you off at the hospital. It's gonna take two seconds, okay?! Is that okay, Cricket, with you, huh?! Go! Come on, come on, get out of the way. I don't want to die. Don't make me do it, Cricket, I will slice you in half. As you can see behind me, Larry, the storm is really taking its toll on weary shoppers. The lines are still long as frustrated customers wait anxiously to return home with some emergency supplies before the worst of the storm hits. Jackie Denardo, Channel 5 News. We out? Good. Hi, hi, hi. I'm Dennis Reynolds. Hi, hi, Dennis. I have a bar, I own a bar, it's my bar, and I wanted to invite you to it for Uh, we have food and supplies, and it would be a good place This storm is going to be bad, as you know, so why not be at the bar with me, um, and, you know, for the good of the race? So come to the bar and, uh, oh, and I have a contr-- an agreement, and I need you to sign Uh, excuse me, sir. Yes. Yeah, it's about the storm. Okay. Storm's not going to hit Philly. It's just going to drizzle. Really? Yeah. How am I supposed to turn that into news? I don't know, find some other way to make these people go nuts. We need a story. Okay, thanks. Hey, Todd, storm's just been downgraded. Apparently we're just going to get a light drizzle. Goddamn it. I have a bunker. Maybe we can turn this into global warming. That always gets people whipped up, huh? Get, get, get if you get in the bunker with me, then, then you'll be totally safe. For the good of the race, we can create an entire Oh, my God, get lost, creep! You're gonna treat me like a dog, huh? You're gonna treat Cricket like a dog? Hospital. Hospital. Come on come on. Hurry it up, move it along. He's taking forever. We're gonna die. Hey, you look kind of Mayan. You wouldn't happen to be a Mayan, would you? Charlie, there you are. I think I found a Mayan. We've been looking all over for you. Cricket's out in the car bleeding like a pig. Seriously? We got to get the supplies right away. I got a great amount of supplies. I've been getting all sorts of stuff, like things Hey, hey, hey, that's my cart. Hey, folks, folks, listen up, I'm sorry, but our credit card machines just went down due to a system overload. We can only accept cash at this time. Oh, shit. What? Okay, well, you got cash? I only have cards. Charlie, where's the cash I gave you? Mac took off with all our cash! He just took off! What?! We're gonna die. I told you, I told you, I told you we're dependant on machines. You guys, once the machines go down, then society collapses. We're going to hell in a handcart. Okay, okay, I got a plan, okay, let's just start looting shit, okay, let's just grab shit. Yes, yes! Let's just grab whatever we can. No, you can't loot until the crowd whips up into a frenzy. The crowd is whipped up into a frenzy. They just stole my cart! I-I think the time will be evident. Well, what are we waiting for?! I don't know. Loot, loot, time to loot, loot! Loot, loot! Take everything! Kill the machines! Kill the machines! It's their fault! Kill the machines! Come on, come on, come on. Get it, get it, get it. Just seconds ago, a car crashed through the building and the crowd is scattering. Despite the fact that the storm has been downgraded, the people have worked themselves into an uncontrollable frenzy! It's the end of days, it's the end of days! Pandemonium has struck. Come to the bunker, come to the bunker! Dennis, I got her, Dennis, I got her! Is this the hospital? Is this the hospital? Ah. Now, this is news.                     So what do you guys wanna do today?
 I don't know.
 We could sing a song. We just ate. We're drinking. Hey, you know what? Mac's coming over here pretty soon Mac's always got something He'll have a plan He always has something. And he'll get us into something good. He comes in with something. He comes in hot. That'll be perfect. 'Cause I feel like we're having a hard time getting into something good today. There he is! There he is! Good timing! Mac in the house. Mac in the house. Mac in the house. Got some news? Got some news for me? Lay it on us. What's the news? What's your news? No, what's your news? Give us the news. Oh, I don't have any news. I thought you guys had news. You always come in hot with news. Yeah, what's the plan? Oh. I got nothin'. Really? Huh? Oh. That's disappointing. You usually fire in here with something. Yeah. I've actually been kinda bored today. We're bored over here. You guys bored, too? We are bored out of our goddamn minds. You got no plan? Didn't run into a thing or?  Don't you remember, love We built this city We built this city on rock 'n' roll  Oh wait guys I know what we can do. You do? Let's play "Chardee MacDennis." Yes! Yes! No! No! No, no No! 'Cause we're not playing! Yes! What's "Chardee MacDennis"? Oh, my God. "Chardee MacDennis" is an awesome board game that we came up with, many years ago, on a day much like today. That sounds like fun. No, we're not playing it! We're not playing it! Don't start chanting it, 'cause we're not playing that stupid game! We are not playing that game! Why? What's the big deal? It's only a game. It's not just a game! It's a war. "Chardee MacDennis: The Game of Games." Now what we did is we took our favorite aspects of a bunch of different board games and we mashed 'em all together. We did the same thing with the name, 'cause we couldn't agree upon one. Now, the point of the game is actually quite simple: It's a race to the finish from Level One to Level Three. This is the board, and we start at Level One, which is "Mind." That consists of "Trivia," "Puzzles" and "Artistry." It is also the level at which the alcohol being consumed is wine. Whoa! You get to drink during the game? Uh, drinking is the game, Frank. It's the whole point of it. I'm not going to play any game in which I'm not getting annihilated. Moving on to Level Two, which is "Body": "Physical Challenge," "Pain" and "Endurance." That's the beer level. Yes, and Level Three is "Spirit": "Emotional Battery" and "Public Humiliation." Boom-- hard alcohol level. What the hell you doing, Deandra? Oh, this is very important, Frank. We gotta nail the board down to the bar, because, at a certain point during the game, Mac can get very pissed off, 'cause he's not doing very well. He's gonna try and flip the board over. He's right; it's for the best. I will forget, later, that it's nailed down.
 He will.
 Okay, here's the big one: There's a 15-minute time limit to the game. a long time for a game. Well, there's a fair amount of a clock stoppages. Yeah, each team gets three time-outs; there's a half-time; post-level breaks; a two-minute warning and a significant amount of injury stoppages. Hence the first-aid kit. Now, pay very close attention to this first part: Each team must collect a certain number of cards, at each level, in order to progress to the next level. And the first team to complete all three levels wins the game. And the winner-- ooh-- the winner gets a sweet prize. Nice! What's the prize? The winner gets to smash the other team's game pieces. That's the prize? You get to smash the team's game pieces? Oh, it's incredibly gratifying. Oh, it's awesome, Frank. Now these are our game pieces. Nice, right?
 And  these.
 are Mac and Charlie's pieces. Look at the condition that they're in. Pretty pathetic, as you can see from the state that these pieces are in, Mac and Charlie have never, ever, in the history of Chardee MacDennis, won the game. You never won? Never won once? No. It's almost statistically impossible to play that many games and never win, but It's truly an anomaly. We haven't won yet, all right? But maybe this is our time, all right? I mean, yeah, it is gonna happen. Watch out! Watch out! Yeah I'm gonna slit throats. Nice. Ack! I love this game! I want in! Okay, I want to be Mac and Charlie's partner. That seems fair to me. Mm-hmm. And I'll say why: Because, you see, Frank's mind is still fairly strong, but his body's very, very weak, so I think it's a wash. And his spirit's garbage, so I'm okay with it, too. Hang on a second, dude. You can't just jump on our team. Let us talk about this. All right, first of all, we got a team photo, right? Yeah. So we're gonna have to decide, you know, do we get a new team photo with or without you Plus, we have a whole new strategy to come up with, you know Our strategy has never worked. And I hate the team photo. Okay, you know what? Just join our team. You're on the team. Yeah! Don't touch me. Don't touch me. Yes, and the Golden Geese are very much looking forward to another annihilation. Yes, we are. Now in the spirit of tradition, I propose that we begin the ritual of sportsmanship. Good luck to you, sir. And you, sir. I do hope you have a good game, miss. And you, sir. Why the hell are youse talkin' like that? Well, this is an important part of the process, Frank. Gives the illusion of respect for your opponent. Things are about to get real dark, real quick, Frank. It's nice to start off on a positive note. Oh, that reminds me: Once the game begins, you are not allowed to ask any questions. Yes! In fact, if you do, don't say a question, look it up in the book of rules, okay? Jesus Christ! Oh, I think I understand. No, you haven't begun to understand, Frank, but that's okay. You'll get it as we go along. Like every other board game. Dee, how much time? Uh, ten seconds. Ah! Perfect! Okay, gentlemen Suck my dick. What the shit are you doing? Goddamn it, Frank. You asked a question! Goddamn it! Frank, Mac, Charlie-- drink for five seconds. Yeah, drink, drink, drink! This is how we get psyched up before each level. Yeah, that's our Maori war dance. That's how we demonstrate intimidation. Shows off our physical prowess! All right, Dee, put two more minutes on the clock. Let's go. Yep. Gentlemen Level One begins. Okay, first card is trivia. Okay, Dee, answer this question correctly, we get the card. Yeah. If not, they get a chance to steal. Yes. All right, what is the greatest band in the world? Chumbawamba. Correct! Nice! Whoa! That's not trivia! That doesn't make sense. We made up all these questions, Frank, so there's gonna be a lot of opinion. Yeah, really, it's more of a memory game than anything else. But drink. Drink, bitch. Let's go. All right, whatever. Our turn. Our turn. Here we go. Ready, Charlie? Yeah. No puzzles, no, puzzles, no puzzles, no puzzles, no puzzles Trivia! Trivia! I can do trivia, baby. Oh, dude, and you definitely wrote this one. Nice. Lay it on me! Lay it on me! Question: "Dennis is asshole. Why Charlie hate"? I don't think I wrote that. You definitely wrote this one, Charlie. Who else would have written this? I'm not remembering that. Oh, my God. I don't think I wrote that one. Of course you did. How many other illiterates are in the? Just throw out a guess. Pass. No! Pass, pass. No, he didn't pass, he didn't pass. Just throw out a guess. Any guess, come on. Pass. Son of a bitch! Oh, Charlie. I can't think of one. All right, chance to steal. Because Dennis is a bastard man. That's what it is. I definitely wrote that. That was it, right? Two card, two cards, two cards. I was mad at you about something, I wrote that. Doesn't matter. The next card is Artistry. And it's all play, so pay attention, guys. All play, all play. We can get it back. "The artist from your team must draw the clue from the card on your teammate's back. The teammate must guess the clue based solely on feel." You ready? I'm going to pass the card over to the drawer. I draw, I draw. Yeah, I don't want to have to read it. Oh, this is hard. All right, ready and You guys ready? Yeah. begin. Go, go, go, go, go. Hey, go. Uh, uh, bird? I'm not getting it, dude. That's because it's impossible to draw. I don't know how to dr Jesus, Dee, your back is so boney and crooked and all over the place, I can't get a flat surface. Anger. Let me have it. Let Frank go. Let me try it. Oh, if only the answer was ribs. Go, Frank, give me Kicking, kicking. He got it. He got it! Son of a bitch. Kicking, kicking. Yeah, I forgot about your stupid strange connection with each other. We get the card, we get the the card. Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink. No puzzles, no puzzles, no puzzles, no puzzles. Chance. Chance. This is a great one, Frank. We stole this straight from Monopoly. It could be good, it could be bad. That's the chance. Got it. Oh, it's like the best one. "Take the money from everyone's pockets." No! Foo-foo, fork over, foo-foo. That's the best card there is. Frank, I don't know what you're so excited for. Give me your money. What, I'm on your team. Frank, the card says "Take the money from everyone's pockets." Everyone. You are everyone. Charlie gave up his 50 I got $500 in my pocket. I'm not putting my money on the table. You got to do it, dude. Give it to me. That's the game. That's a part of the game, Frank. Let me see that card. No, if you're going to play the game Let me see that card. If you're going to play the game Let me see the card! That's not a part of the game. Why don't you show him the card. Let him see the card. "Swallow this card whole." Cheating! Cheating! Cheating. You've been caught cheating. Time's up. You've been caught cheating. We're on the same team, dude. Look, Frank, cheating is tolerated, it's accepted, it's like a big part of the game, but if you get caught cheating, they advance to the next level. You ruined my scheme. Well, you know, in his defense, you were trying to steal his money. Yeah. It was not the time to cheat, dude. Enjoy that. Only one card down. Yeah, well, it's too late now. What's done is done. Uh-oh. So Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! To the Game of Games. Yes, Frank, good, you're getting it. Very civil. Can questions now I ask that clock stop-ed? Okay, just 'cause you jumble up the words doesn't make it not a question. But the answer is yes. When the clock is stopped, all rules are off and civility reigns. They advance, do we? Ah, yes, I'll explain it to you, Frank. It can get a little confusing. They are now in Level Two. Which means they need only two cards to advance to Level Three. We are still in Level One. It's a goddamn mind boggler. Yeah, I've never really understood it, but the point is, if Mac's telling you what to do, listen. Okay. Now at Level Two, there is no more cursing. Oh, yeah. Big-time Level Two rule. All right, where we at here? Where we at? Oh, gentlemen, it's time. Oh, is it? Kick it! You flinch, you lose. Here we go. Didn't wince, all right. Nothing. Not even a All right. Oh! Aw, come on. Nothing. The problem is his hands are like So tiny. If Dee had gotten this, we could have just Obliterated those giant paws. All right, I got him. I'm going to put it right in the center of his hand. Do it, do it. Cheese and crepes! All right, hit him, hit him! Dadgumit! Let me have a go at it. Yeah, here. Oh! Wait for it. Wait for it. Cheese and crepes. Son of a gun. Cheese and crepes! Dee, we'll be taking this card. Cheese and crow. All right, it's our turn. Let's go get the cards. Let's do it. No, puzzles, no, puzzles, no puzzles, no puzzles, no puzzles, no puzzles, no puzzles, no puzzles, no puzzles Chance. All right, okay. Okay, could be good, could be bad. "Go to jail. Do not pass Go. Do not collect $200." Sam of a bush. Okay, we take our pieces, we put them in jail. Oh, no, no, no, no. Frank, see, you don't get it. There's no jail on the board. So you go in there. You got to be kidding me. No, jail's a dog kennel. You can get out, but you're not going to like how. You got to eat a cake. That's sounds good. It's not. You have to eat the ingredients of a cake. Aw, shit. One, by one Oh! No! Oh! Stop the clock! Dude! Aw, I hate this game. I hate this game. All right, all right, all right, we drink for five seconds. No, you're not getting it. In Level Two, the other team counts. Four five. Awful. No more cursing. No more cursing. Get in jail. Let's go. You might want to brush up on some of these rules while you're in there too, pal. Yeah. That's a good idea. Let him read the rule book. All right, our turn. Ooh, I'll play. "Physical challenge-- The Grape Gobble." Oh, nice. Grape Gobble's my thing, man. Charlie's favorite board game-- Hungry Hungry Hippos. Ready, set, go. Go, go, go. Go, Charlie, go, Charlie. Put my cage on the bar so I can see. Shut up, dog. Gobble, gobble, come on. Come on, Dee, go, go, go. And time. Ho! Ho! That's time. Oh, no. It's only five. I only got five. Oh, sheets! Bed sheets! Yeah! You definitely got more than five! Yeah, yeah! I ate, like, 12! Wait, wait, whoa, whoa. You're not supposed to eat them. Th-The rule is you're supp You're not supposed to eat them. There's no way we can tell how many you We win the level. We have Big Bubble. We get the card! Level three! Level three now! Wait, they're still inside me! I can get them out! Doesn't matter! Golden Geese! Golden Geese! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! We move on to Level Three! I hate this game! I hate this game! Oh, now this part. Okay. Oh, yes. Know this game. Board flipping, cheating. I'm so sick from that cake stuff. Well, you shouldn't have even eaten it, man, 'cause the game's gonna be over in, like, a second. They're gonna kill us. Hold on a second. I got a plan. When I was in the cage, I had the books. Save it, Frank. There's no way we can beat them, okay? They are tailor-made for level three. Last time we played, Dee got "Emotional Battery," we berated that bitch for, like, two straight hours. I mean, really personal stuff. Way over the line. The kind of stuff that cuts you to the core, you know. She held it together without a single tear. Dude, when her two minutes were up, she cried for a month straight. Yeah, it was really sad. Every day, crying all day long. She talked about taking too many pills. I think she tried to kill herself. She did, she did. I saw it, but I didn't tell you about it. Are you bitches ready for round three? 'Cause you're going down, clowns. Dennis, I want to tell you something. Yeah? I hope I get "Emotional Battery" this time, from them, because this is why-- you guys, you always emotional batter me. And I'm gonna, I'm fine with it. And I don't care about it. I'm getting good at it now. So that's something that I hope for this game. Okay. Let me help you with that. Oh, Frank. Frank, come on! Okay, so I broke another rule. Oh, you did? You broke a rule? Don't rat us out if it's a rule! Probably not a rule. Let's keep playing. It probably is a rule. I don't think it's a rule. I think it is. Rule 463: When a player spills his or her drink, his or her team has to chug the opponent's drinks. Oh! You are a terrible, terrible teammate. I don't want to chug hard alcohol on top of all this wine. It's like No, that's okay, you don't have to do it. You don't have to, because you guys are in Level One. You can't even drink hard alcohol, anyway. You're trying to trick us. They're trying to trick us 'cause then we'll not drink it and it'll be a rule that we had to drink it. No, no, it's fine. No tricking us. Hey, we're playing the game. We're playing the game. It's Chardee MacDennis. This tastes like water. This is water. Aha! I knew it! Well I knew it was water. When he threw his beer in my face, I could taste it. Shut up, dog! Cheaters! Yeah Cheaters. You've been cheating! We caught you cheating! Eff you in the A! Eff you in the A! Congratulations, all right? Fudge on crackers, all right? Mr. Falconing sons of birds! Mother fathers, you've caught us cheating for the first time in, like, 18 games. If the team ahead gets caught cheating, then the team behind jumps to their level, which means Level Three! Level Three! Level Three! Okay. We've never been to Level Three before! I'm going to Level Three! I'll see you in Level Three! Yep, yep, yep, yep.  The team going to Level Three We are the team going to Level Three  That was the buzzer. Oh. The timer's never gone off before. Well, so what does that mean? Wait, look that up, because you guys always win before the timer goes off, so It means we have to draw the black card. I don't remember a black card. There's a black card? I don't remember. I don't remember a black card at all. Black-- guys, this could be some dark shit right here. Here it is. This is gonna be a battle to the death. Ooh! Ooh, that's scary. All right, read it. Open it, open it, open it, open it! Brace yourself. Get ready. Here I go. Huh? What I don't know. Why I don't know. "In the event of a tie, a winner must be chosen. There can be only one. And so it comes to this: Flip a coin." Flip a goddamn coin? That's what we came up with? Flip a coin. That's lame as shit. Oh, now I remember. When we were writing the rules, at one point, we just got really bored, and we phoned it in. That is so lame! No, it's awesome. Think about this, Mac. They can't out-cheat us, they can't outsmart us. This isn't about, like, physical endurance or anything like that. This is just up to the gods right now, Mac! And there's a 50-50 chance we're winning this whole thing, right now. No. Tails never fails. Tails never fails! Tails never fails. Frank, we're taking tails! All right, all right, just flip the coin. All right. Flip that coin. Flip that coin! Flip that coin! Flip that coin! Flip that coin! Flip that coin! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! Yeah! Ah, that felt good. Losers.                     I know, but I can't believe I never even noticed this place before. I walk by it all the time. How could you notice it? There's no sign outside. Yeah, what's up with that? You think it like blew down in a storm or something? No, no storm. I think the owners did it on purpose 'cause they think it's cool. Yeah. They blew on their sign until it came off 'cause they thought it was cool? I mean, who does that? No, no, nobody blew anything. Hey, Dee, how did you find out about this place? Somebody sent me a link to their Facebook page. Facebook-- that's why everybody's here. What the hell is this? What? Is this water? No, it's gin. Aw! Gin?! I hate gin! Get me a beer! Get me a beer! Get me a beer! Beer! It's a gin bar. All they have is gin. Are you kidding? What? You mean to tell me there's this many people in this joint-- all they serve is gin? The only reason that people are here, is because Facebook tells them to come here. This is the kind of shit we need at Paddy's. Paddy's got no Web presence. You are absolutely right. The whole world is connected now. It's all connected by Bill Gates and that rain man, Zuckerberg. He and his Jews have connected the whole world, and now they're toppling regimes. And Egypt and Japan and the Jews are all peaceful together I understand the spirit of what you're saying. Yeah. Facebook is connecting everyone these days. Even people in the Middle East. That's what I'm talking about. Hell, and look people are showing up to a bar that doesn't even have a sign, and serves only one old-timey disgusting drink that nobody likes. Goddamn I hate gin. Dee, you bitch. That's the thing. This place has got a good business model. We have to emulate it. That's absolutely right. We have to get rid of all the beer in Paddy's. We have to blow the sign off of the building-- you know, maybe I'll do the blowing, that's fine. Charlie, Charlie, stop, stop, stop, stop. Do you think a human being can blow a sign off of a building? I didn't until Mac said it. I never said that. A man cannot blow a sign off of a building. In Charlie's defense, you could loosen the screws, get up there and blow We are talking about the Internet. You are derailing the conversation. Shh! Ugh. Ew. What the hell was that? Okay, don't worry about it, okay. Guys, we got to get on this. He's absolutely right. No distractions. Paddy's needs to get connected. Look at the Gin Bar's Facebook page. They have like 50,000 friends. Crazy. Links to Twitter viral videos. Their Web presence is a amazing. We could do a viral video for Paddy's. Well, we can't afford not to. That's right. We'll do a really cool video of how we serve gin in spaghetti cans or something like that. And we take the sign down. Frank, you're getting hung up on the wrong things. The old booze and the no sign have nothing to do with it. Yeah, what kind of a douchebag walks into a bar just because it doesn't have a sign outside of it? That's stupid, Frank. Use your head. But that's the most important thing-- exclusivity. Weird drinks, no sign, that's cool. Maybe so, but I like Paddy's sign, so it stays up. I got the sign down. And there's no way a man could have blown that off of our bar. There's just no way. You're totally wrong about that, Mac. Yeah. I never once said that! You did not? Okay, forget it, forget it. Charlie, we're doing a viral video thing now, okay? All right. Can I stop all this for one second? I don't mean to derail us, 'cause this is very, very important stuff, but, um, I'm getting a little hung up on something. The guy that shushed us last night-- is that bugging anybody else? I've been thinking about that, too. Have you been thinking about that? I really have. What are you talking about? You were in the middle of telling Charlie to keep quiet. I was telling him to be quiet, I was telling him to be quiet. I tell everybody to be quiet. I don't shush them like they're animals. I use my words. Whatever. I'm going to go get the video camera. Yeah. Yes. Guys, you're normally very excited about making videos, all right? Guys, let's just focus. We have bigger fish to fry. Yeah, let it go. I can't let it go. I can't let it go either. I won't let it go. I'm irritated by it. I'm not going to let it go. Uh, yeah, but the viral video thing is very important. We'll get to that. And we'll pop a shush on the guy and we'll be right back. Let's Yeah. You can just find the guy on Facebook. That's where you find people these days. You aren't going to find the guy on Facebook. There's three billion people on there. Are you crazy? Yeah, you don't even know the guy's name. We don't know his name. Go on Facebook, magically find a guy. Facebook. Found him. Really? Yeah. He was friends with the Gin Bar. Holy shit. Yeah, that's him. That's him. Facebook is amazing. Right? We are all connected. Okay. We are all connected. Yeah, we're connected. So let's get back to business. Uh, viral video. Yeah, but now that I'm seeing his face Mm-hmm. I got to be honest It was very annoying last night that. It pissed me off, all right? Maybe we can just, you know, send him a friend request and then Yeah, see if he responds. And then we'll get back to what we were doing. Okay, yeah, distracted. Did he respond? Not yet. How long does it usually take? You know, it depends on if he's online or not. Refresh. Refresh. No. What if you hit it faster? I mean, here's the problem with, like, Facebook and Twitter. You know, everyone says, oh, it's changing the world, but not in a good way, you know. We're not connected with each other anymore. Tweeting-- that's not having a conversation. What is that? I know. And then these people who do that shit, they hear you having a real conversation with your real buddies, your real pals, and they get all jealous and pissed off and they want to shush you. Yeah, right. And you know what else is bugging me about this guy? I cannot get past the fact that we're perfect strangers. He doesn't know me. I mean, for all this guy knows, I'm a psychopath with a trunk full of chainsaws, right? He shushs me 'cause he doesn't like the volume of my conversation? Next thing he knows he's chopped to bits in a basement somewhere, you know? Was that worth it? No. And I could be a man with a fist full of hammers Right. and a trunk full of duct tape and zip ties. You know, this guy doesn't know me. Is he crazy? It's very upsetting to me that he didn't consider any of that. Yeah, well, this is not a considerate man, Charlie. This is a rude man, and they are very seldom the same people. Yeah. Uh, sir? Yeah? Can we get you for a second? We've got a What can I get for you guys? Well, we're looking for a man. Yeah, this guy was a real douchebag. He was in here the other night. Yeah, douche-y looking. Kind of douche-y. Yeah, I wish I had a picture of the guy, but we don't. Oh, he's a shusher. Oh, yes, right. This is a douchebag who goes around shushing people that he doesn't even know. Yeah, people who could have chainsaws. Or hammers. I mean, is any of this ringing a bell to you? No. Sorry. But I don't really see what the big deal is. The big deal. You don't see what the big deal is? The big deal, sir, is that a grown man shushed me and my friend here. We demand satisfaction from this person, okay? We got to find this guy because we've got some important shit that we're trying to do on the Internet, or whatever. We have much bigger things going on. The sign is down, okay? The sign is down. He took our sign down. It's never been down, you see what I'm saying? No. I'm getting frustrated. I'm also very frustrated. Look, how would you like to be shushed? Don't think I'd care. Shh! How'd that feel? I mean, I was finished speaking. Well, shh to you! Again, I was done, so You're speaking too fast. Stop speaking in such short sentences. Then we can shush you in the middle and you'll know how it feels. Okay, do you guys want a drink, or what? Yeah. Yeah, we want drinks. Absolutely. Okay, two house specials? Shh! Specials, yeah. Yeah, two house specials. Got interrupted. How'd that feel? On your away. I think you got him with that one, though. I don't exactly feel good about it. No. But he had to know how it feels. Yeah, but you nailed him. Thanks, man. Hey, you know, I think I know how we can get a picture of this shusher guy. What you thinking? Refresh. Goddamn it. Why won't this guy be our friend? It's like an online shush. You know, I Okay, Paddy's Pub has over 30 friends at this point. Why will this guy not accept our friend request. He's too good for us? Don't complain, just hit refresh again. You son of a bitch! I got the video camera. All right, Mac, say, "I got infected." What? Say it. I got infected. Get that away from me. Deandra, okay, now here we go. Say, "I got the bug." No, I'm busy, Frank. Say, "bug." Bug! What are you doing? I'm shooting the virus thing. What virus thing? The virus thing that you guys said we were going to infect all our friends with on Facebook or whatever. Oh! We got him! We got him? We got you, Dylan Toback! You giant douche! Are you guys gonna help me do the virus thing, or what? We're busy right now, Frank. Yeah, we're doing the shushing thing first, Frank. But you said the virus video was the most important thing! No, no! No! We said the viral video is very important, and it is very important-- but we're on to this now. You know, we'll do it later. Why don't you get it started and then we'll come and fix what you did, okay? All right, but hurry up. Oh, check out these updates: "I am a man-whore. I hate women. I am a liar." He admits that he is a liar. Son of a bitch! Uh, looks like he is shopping for a silk sash at Tootie's, on South Street. A silk sash at Tootie's? What an asshole. Hm. Okay Daddy got a new plan. Mm-hmm. Daddy got a new plan. Let's head down to Tootie's and we'll fire a shush right in his face. We'll shush him real quick. But we won't tell Dennis and Charlie, 'cause they mocked us. Eventually, we'll tell them, though, right? Well, we won't tell them right now, but we'll come back and we'll jam it in their faces. Freeze! Yeah, once we shush him. Okay, let's go. Okay. All right. Great idea. Great idea! I want to make sure you got the nose right, though. That's the most important part to me, because it was an annoying nose. It was an It was a nose that you wanted to smack, yeah. And then, give him, like, almond eyes if you You've already said that. And don't compliment the man. It's not a compliment from me, 'cause I don't like people with almond eyes. I find it creepy. All right, well, can we just take a look at the drawing? Because we kinda need to get out of here. You've done an excellent job. Really good! Wow! And what is your technique, sir, because I want to learn that. That is You know, the only thing that would help this, is if you had him do this gesture Oh, my God.
 When the man assaulted us
 Mr. Reynolds, Mr. Kelly, I'm Detective Larson. I'm gonna need to clear something up on your report here. It doesn't Yeah, we're good. We're good, actually, 'cause we got It says here this was filed as an assault, but the only thing that you're claiming was that this man shushed you? Yeah. Yeah. But it was an assault. Shushing somebody is not an assault. There was more to it than He-- yeah-- it wasn't just shushing, though Yeah And the reason it was an assault was because he was shushing our cries for help. Right. This guy was raping us Well wha? He was raping you. Yeah, well, yeah Yeah. Mm-hmm. The both of you? No. You can't rape two guys. No no, no, no. I wouldn't even necessarily classify it You know what happened was that he only raped my friend here. I actually shook him off in time. The guy never quite made it inside of me but, my friend here, yeah So he was only raping you? Yep. Yeah yeah. He, like, really, kinda made soup of your insides No n no, no. He barely, he barely made it in there, so, trust me, I'm fine. Yeah, but he bit his dick. Not-- what?! No, he did He, he the reason we were going to file as a rape was because he did make it inside me, but, like, just barely. And the guy was super-small, so I'm fine. And then I did get away. Well, don't-don't-don't write any of this down. Look, can we just drop the case? Yeah! Right? We don't need to We just need the drawing I don't even think about that, because if we have the drawing, we can find the guy. We can dole out the justice, and I'll mend this guy's And then this never needs to go in any files anywhere. If you and Mr. Reynolds are filing a false police report, there's no way in hell you're getting out of here with that drawing. All right, Charlie. I got another plan. How's that? That's perfect. That looks exactly like him! Yeah, I mean, he wasn't in a dune buggy and he didn't have No, he was not. a propeller on his head, like that, but I like the shushing, though. You nailed the shushing! Tootie's Tootie's This is it. Ew! Is that him? That's him. That is him. Let's do this. Hey, Dylan Toback. Oh! Hey. Sorry about that, ma'am. Hi, ma'am. Uh, we thought you were this guy, Dylan Toback. He shushed us and And we were gonna shush him back, yeah. Yeah. We didn't think you were a man, per se I did. Okay, I did, too. I did because of your hair. Here's why: it's the hair and it's the cardigan, and it's the build It's the way you stand, and the broad shoulders. But that's okay. That's okay. There's nothing you can do about that. Have a nice day. I'm still confused. I'm very confused. It's sort of a transgender situation. Are you guys looking for Dylan Toback? Yeah. Do you know him? He posted on Facebook that he was here. Well, can you guys keep a secret? No! Yes. Yes. Yes, I can yes, yes. Yes, yes. That wasn't him, it was me. I started a Facebook page to get back at him. I'm his ex-girlfriend and he was the worst. He was always, like, "Sally, send me money." "Sally, mail me hair." Mail him hair? Weird, right? Yeah, and then he posted a bunch of naked pics of me online, and that was the last straw. Oh, my God! That's disgusting! Naked pics online? Where? Where did he post those? I don't know. One of those disgusting ex-girlfriend porno sites. Aw, those disgusting ex-girlfriend porno sites! I mean, there's so many of them, though! Which one? Which one did he post it on? Do you know where we can find him? Oh, I can give you his address. I don't give a shit. Really? Great! Great! Also, put down one of the sites that was Listen, do you want to come with us, and maybe get some payback?
 That's well
 Here's the thing: he's never actually met me. Well, the pics I sent were a little more flattering than I actually am, and so we just sort of had this online relationship. Mm! Mm-hmm. But the hair I mailed was mine. That was real. Okay, you know what? This chick is douchier than Dylan. Let's get outta here! Yeah. No, I'm not even gonna look for those nude photos. I might. I might, though. I might. Come on, man-- this guy's been in here. He's got the annoying nose that you wanted to smack Evil almond eyes. I'm sorry, guys, I've never seen a cartoon character in here shushing people before. Well, he wasn't in a dune buggy, he was Look, use your imagination. Yeah, he's not a cartoon character, okay? Would you just take this seriously? I don't see how I could take this seriously. He's not helping. No. He's not going to be a help to us. You're just going to be difficult, so just go get us more gin drinks. That's all you're good for. More of the gin. God. All right Here's what I'm gonna do, Charlie. I'm going to write "Rude man who shushes, please call" at tat top, and then, at the bottom, I'll put my phone number. Right. Right? And then we'll make a shitload of copies, we'll put them up all over town, and it'll act like a wanted poster. Okay, wait, so you want the rude man to call you? No, I want people to call me about the rude man. But, if the rude man calls me that works, too. That works, too! All right. That's gonna work. Now, hold on a second-- you're cool just putting your personal information out there? Yeah! I'm absolutely cool with that, man, because I'm saying "connect with me." Right. See, that's what we're talking about-- people just don't connect these days. I'm saying call me, let's have a phone conversation. Yeah, don't tweet. Don't just tweet me, don't shush me-- you know, let's connect. Let's have a connection, you know? Don't be rude! Let's talk about rude people. Let's talk about people who do rude things, you know? Mm-hmm. I guarantee you, people will respect this. Okay, one little roadblock, no big deal. But let's shush this guy and get out of here, because it's starting to get complicated. Yeah. And what was happening back there? Sending nude pictures of yourself? That's just stupid, and that's desperate. Yeah, and hair?! I mean, sending hair-- that's just demented. Well, the hair I don't really have a problem with. What are you talking about? What is the point of that? You send your hair to a guy and, you know, you just give that guy a sense of you and your smells and you know Oh! Oh! Goddamn it! We're looking for Dylan Toback. Is he around? Oh, Lord I knew this day would come. Um come in. Okay, but listen, we don't have a lot of time, okay? Um, a few months ago, my daughter Jamela bought me this brand-new computer, and she put it right here Speed up, speed up, speed up! Okay, so, ever since Jerry got put on life support-- Whoa! Slow down, slow down, slow down! Ew! I didn't see him there. I've had nothing but time on my hands. And I've been so lonely, you know? Okay, well, does any of this have anything to do with Dylan Toback? Oh, why is she doing that? Um I am Dylan Toback. No, no, no Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm Don't say that! We don't have time for that, okay? Is anybody online the person who they say that they are? Okay, do you know how to find the real Dylan Toback? Well, what I'm saying is he doesn't exist. I made up the name Dylan Toback. I've made up dozens of names. I'm really good at it. My real name is Catfish! What the hell is happening here? Here's what I gather. I think she went on the Gin Bar's Web site, found a picture of that guy and then made up a whole name and personality for him. So we don't know the guy's name. No. We don't even know if he's on Facebook. Nope. How the hell are we gonna find him? I don't know. Well, how did you find me? Was it that Sally? Because that bitch been getting on my nerves. So you know Sally? Oh, uh, Dylan knows Sally. No, he doesn't, 'cause Dylan isn't real, and you know what? Sally isn't Sally anymore; Sally is now Dylan. And what about the nude photos? I mean This is not about the nude photos, Mac Shh! Shh! Don't you shush me! Don't you shush us, goddamn it. Don't disturb Jerry. Disturb Jerry? I'm disturbed. He should be disturbed. This whole thing is disturbing, and if you shush me one more time I will put you in the ground. Do you hear me? Okay you know what? Dee, Dee! We're losing focus, all right? Let's just get back to the bar, we'll find the nude photos Oh, yeah, yeah, let's-let's focus on the Well, hold on. Don't you want your hair back?
 Is that your hair, Dee?
 Oh, come on. You're Carl Lundegard? Yeah. I mean, what is the problem? Are we not putting these in the right part of town? We put them in every part of town Oh, oh, here we go, here we go. Okay, come on. Hello? Saw that guy you were looking for. You did? Yeah. Oh, that's great, okay, can you tell us where exactly the Shh! Uh, no, oh, you do not! Oh! You ugh! He shushed me. Another one? Yes, another shusher shushing me on the phone. All right, maybe the poster is the problem because it says "Rude man who shushes please call" Right. So rude men are calling just to shush you. This is prank calls. Am I gonna have to change my phone number? I mean, that's Yes, because you never want to put your personal information out there in the world. It's like People abuse it. Yo! Did you find the guy? No. He's unfindable. We just hit a bunch of dead ends, right? The guy is a ghost, I'm telling you. I know! We tried to track him down on Facebook, but it got very strange. Like, it was just a bunch of girls pretending to be boys, and Dee banged a o fat old black la, and then sent her hair. Okay, that's not Hey! I did the video, and I sent it to all of Paddy's Facebook friends. You did? Yeah. Frank to the rescue. Oh, ho! Frank saves the day. All right. Good work, Frank. Nice. Check out what you got here.

Everybody out there is lying to get what they want; why can't we? Totally. We have a variety of old liquors served in strange containers. We are packed with celebrities-- the fun ones. We also have cockfights and strippers. And guess what? We don't have a sign, so good luck finding the place. But if you do, you'll be lucky. 'Cause we also got donkey shows, Motley Crue and cake.

See, the problem is we got focused on the guy. We didn't help him with his This whole thing is a total mess. I mean, absolutely nothing good has come of today.
 No, we wasted all of our
 Excuse me. This is a bar, right? We noticed you guys didn't have a sign out front. Thought that was pretty cool. You guys open? Yes, we are. Charlie, lock the door. Come on in.  Oh                       Damn it, damn it, damn it! This is such a stupid goddamn situation. We got to get out of here, Dennis. We've got to get out of here. We need a plan. Okay, well, plan one is for you to lower your goddamn voice. This is as low as I go, okay? I say we bum-rush her and choke her out with her own belt. Dee, yore escalating shit. This is exactly what I'm talking about. We immediately escalate everything to a ten. It's ridiculous. I mean, somebody comes in with some preposterous plan or idea. And then all of a sudden, everybody's on the gas. Nobody's on the brakes. Nobody's thinking. Everybody's just talking over each other with one idiotic idea after another. Until, finally, we find ourselves in a situation where we've broken into somebody's house. And the homeowner is home. Yes, yes. I'm sick of it, Dee. Okay. We can't do this anymore. Okay. We've got to examine our process. Fine. I'm on board with that, okay? But right now I'm trying to come up with solutions. So if you don't want to choke her out, we wot choke her out. But you need to help me come up with a plan, p okay? Because this is breaking and entering. Oh, my God. Dee, your breath is hideous. I mean, it smells bad. Okay. Okay. Oh, my God. We are really in over our heads this time. I'm saying, this was a totally avoidable situation. I know. I know I'm not innocent in all this, okay? I know I shouldn't have stood on that table and given that awesome speech about how I was the perfect one to lead us into the house because of my wonderful grace. I know that. I regret that now. It was a very persuasive speech. Oh, she's packing a suitcase. I definitely regret you getting quadruple onions on your burger. I'm sorry, I didn't realize I was going to be trapped in a closet with you for the afternoon. I definitely regret being dragged along into this whole thing. For what purpose would you have been dragged? You nosed your way into this like you do everything. You are nothing but liabilities, Dee. Oh, come on. Loud voice, breath reeks. Nosey. Oh, she's leaving. She's leaving. She's gone. Okay, okay, okay. I'm gonna call Mac and Charlie. Okay. Guys, come in. Are you there? Yes, extraction team. What is your status? Have you recovered the artifact yet? No. We are off the artifact plan. We are not doing the artifact plan anymore. It is a stupid plan. Negative, negative. It is an awesome plan, okay? This family should not have the artifact. It belongs in a museum. Belongs in a museum, bro. Adults should not be making plans that are based on dumb movies! Excuse me? Indiana Jones is a dumb movie? I-I like the first one. Oh, God. I-I like him as a character. Oh, God. Come on. But some of the mov-- Okay, listen It's not about that. I'm just saying that the plan was genuinely dumb, as many of our plans are, I now realize. What about your whole speech about "I have the grace of a falcon, and I'll be in and out like a demon's whisper"? Dude, you stood up on your chair in that burger restaurant and said that speech for everybody! It was a damn good speech. It was very persuasive. But I regret it now. I got to pee. No. Dee, Dee, what-what are you doing? She could come back in here at any moment. Well, what Indiana Jones: Part 4 was dumb. I'll give you that, yeah. I wouldn't even count it. I'm gonna say Temple of Doom's out for me, as well. Is it out for you? That's also dumb. I liked that one. Uh Um, guys, can we talk about this later? Frank, let's go. We're bailing. I ain't going nowhere until I get that vase. Forget about the vase, Frank. We're bailing on the vase, okay? Frank's right actually, okay? We got to thing about the vase. We got to think about what's best for the vase. Yes, we are men of honor who protect artifacts from those who steal them. What? You didn't give a shit about artifacts two hours ago.o. So what? Now we do. Yeah, what's that have to do with anything? Well, we should not be committing crimes based on beliefs that are two hours old. Well, then don't read us newspaper articles about stolen artifacts that outrage us. That article was about how the museum is holding an auction to raise money, okay? Nothing was stolen. The vase is not stolen. Yeah, as a matter of fact, only if we follow through with this plan will the vase be stolen. Well, you were the ones who escalated us off of being the extraction team. We could have gotten in and out of there. Well, escalate your way back in, for all I give a shit. I'm leaving. I quit. Me, too. Well, I'm still in. Living on the edge. It's making me feel alive. Shh! Yes! See, now, Frank, that is why you are on the extraction team. Frank's got the attitude, Dennis has the grace Dee nosed in. She nosed in. Dee was dragged. Oh, shit. Extraction team, there is an SUV pulling up in front of the house. There is a man getting out. Okay, I cannot see the driver's face, but the subject appears to have pointed feet of some kind. Okay, I'm repeating here. He has pointed feet, so careful now. What does that mean? What does that mean? He's wearing cowboy boots. Okay, yes, I'm seeing now that they are cowboy-- you know, his feet could be pointed on the inside, so let's be They're definitely not pointed on the inside. How do you know that? How do you know that? They're definitely not-- I mean, I guess I can't say for sure. You don't know that for sure. Sweetheart? You home? Up here, darling! What? Is she coming back up here? Why is she coming back up here? Oh, shit, back in the closet. Yippee-i-ki-yay. All right. What the hell? Oh, I just saw her put the vase in the suitcase. What? No. We can barely even tell if that's a person and a suitcase. I have to pee so bad. Deandra, your breath is dog shit. I know. What are you doing home? Well, I got a call from the alarm coarmpany. They said it was the house. This is bad. Oh, I must have set if off. I just popped by to grab a jacket. I told you you'd be chilly. Yeah, you're always right about that, honey. Well, I got an appointment, you know. Oh, yeah. I-I'm heading back to the office. Bye, sugar. Bye. What the hell was that? Very strange. That was close. Give me a chip. No, no. These are my chips. You don't get a chip. What's going on in there? Basically, these people are Southern, and the lady lied to the man. Are they gone? I don't know. Let's just quietly get out. It's phase time, bitches. What? What? No, no, no, no. What are you doing, Frank? We are in a very dangerous situation here. These people are from the South. That's weird. People from the South don't usually move up North. Oh, no, they come up. These carpetbaggers come up by the truckloads just to steal our artifacts. Carpetbaggers, huh? Yeah. Give me a chip. No, you don't get chips, Charlie! I mean, God only knows what these people will do to us if they catch us. These Southerners, they probably pray for a home invasion every single day. They can't wait to get their hands on home invaders, so they can blast them with shotguns and-and, uh, do God knows what to them, Frank. We'll be lucky if the only thing that happens is we go to jail. We have got to go. Hey, if some hillbilly comes up to me, I'm gonna lash him in the face, that's all. No, Frank. They are always armed to the teeth. They will hogtie us and hang us out on the front lawn or burn us on a cross. You're right, man. You got to be careful. You know, anytime you find out, like, some dude's got a crazy torture basement or something, it's someone from the South. It always is. You know what, extraction team, why don't you go down to the basement and see if it's some kind of crazy type dungeon. Yeah, yeah. Dungeons and tons of guns and-- dude, please give me a chip. You're not getting shit, okay?! Come on! Leave it alone with the chips. If you wanted chips, you could've gotten a bag at the hamburger store. Don't ask me again! I can't listen to this shit anymore. Ooh! Hmm. Q-tip holder. Shit. Oh, problem solved. Can we just get out of here? Oh, wait, wait, wait. Hold on, hold on. I think you need to see this. Dee, you are nosing in. Nip it in the bud. A whole bunch of tickets to The Jay Leno Show. Who cares? No. Listen to me. Who wants to see Jay Leno 15, 16 times? No one. No one wants to see him once. At all, right? I got a theory. She's banging Leno. She's having an affair with Leno. Frank, if she was banging Jay Leno, why would she have to buy a bunch of tickets to his show? That's stupid, Frank. Use your head. I've got an idea, though. She's trying to kill him. She's still very upset about the whole Conan thing. Oh, my God! That's it-- she's icing Leno. She's packing her suitcase. She's sneaking away from her husband. Listen to me. Those are the theories of lunatics. Okay. We have got to get to get out of here now. Yes, he's right. Let's go. No. Back off, bitch. I ain't leaving until I get that vase. Stop it! Stop it. He's gonna hurt himself. Never should have let him have that whip. For God sake, let's just get out of here. Let's go, come on. Okay, I think the back door's this way. Dee, you gangly, uncoordinated bitch, I am not getting hogtied over your lack of grace. I hope they hogtie you. And then I hope the rape you in their basement for ten years. Dee, listen to me. Go! I'm telling you, I have a weird feeling about this. He just randomly comes home with some story about the alarm. He knows something. Look, we should just do it now. Pull the trigger. Pull the trigger? What does that mean? Who is she talking to? What is she talking about pulling the trigger on? I don't know. I mean, until now, I was thinking this Southern violence talk was just, you know, bull shit. It was just an escalation of some kind. Mm-hmm. But now I think it might not be, you know what I mean? Uh-huh. I mean, who is she talking to right now? Who is that person? They're gonna pull the trigger on somebody? Jesus Christ. I mean, I'm only asking because I think knowing this might help us get out of this mess. You know what I'm saying? Mm. Mm-hmm. What is going on with you, Dee? You should be nosing into this like crazy right now. I can't hold it anymore. What? The toilet's right behind you, so I'm just gonna go ahead and pee in it. Oh, no, no. You are just gonna intentionally spray DNA all over the crime crime. I'm not gonna spray anything anywhere. Are you not familiar with how a woman urinates? Yes, I am, Dee, but you cannot flush the toilet. It's going to make too much noise. Then you're just gonna have a bowl full of evidence. Okay, well, you've got a really good point, but I'm going to do it anyway, okay, so it's it's happening, it's happening. You can't do it, you can't do it, no. It's happening. Watch me. Oh, my God. You are all liabilities. Why did you nose your way into this? I hate you. Okaym , I'm gonna go find Mac ad Charlie so they create a diversion so we can get the hell out of here. Don't pee with me in the room! Right now, yeah, go ahead and go. Oh, thank you, God. Mac? Charlie? Come in. Mac? Charlie? I'm telling you, Charlie, the situation is out of control. Let's just get out of here while we still can. Without the guys? Oh, they're as good as dead. There's no telling what those Southern people are gonna do to them. You're right, man. You know what? We should just get the hell out of here, and I mean out of Philadelphia. I mean, we should just drive and drive and drive and not look back. We should go to Arizona and open up that imported leather shop that we've always talked about. Oh, my God, the leathers, yes-- the tasseled leathers, the turquoise studs on the leathers. All the leather. Yeah. Okay, okay, do you have the keys on you? Yeah, let's get the keys. Let't s get the keys. Let's get out of here. Hey, hey, hey, hey, I heard all that. Were you holding down the button? It was an accident. I wasn't It was just sort of a reflex. You're always holding that thing down, and What? I'm Uh, sorry, extraction team. We were having a leather conversation. We're-We're Doesn't really Hey, um, what's the status on the vase? Do not take off on us! I repeat, do not take off on us. Leather shop in Arizona? Are you serious? There are far too many leather shops in Arizona as it is. You would be out of business in a week's time. What did you expect us to do, okay? You got us all freaked out in here, sitting here waiting for the Southerners to tie us up to horses and then have them run in opposite directions, ripping us apart. Yeah. How are we not supposed to fantasize about opening up imported leather shops in Arizona? Yeah, give me a chip. No, you're not getting the chips. The chips are off the table, okay? I want a chip! Don't bring up the chips. Give me a chip. He wants chips, and I asked him in the store, Dennis, you were there. I said, "Charlie, do you want a bag of chips?" He said, "No, I don't want chips." If you wanted the goddamn chami, you should have gotten the goddamn chips at the hamburger shop! Stop, calm down, calm down, listen. We need the two of you to create a diversion so that we can sneak out of the house. She just flushed the toilet. Yeah, fine, it's just-- fine, I'm just hungry. We'll do a diversion. Oh, shit, I just thought of something. What? What if this vase is cursed, okay? Maybe that's why things aren't going well, right? If this vase has a curse on it, you do not want to touch it. I repeat, do not touch this vase if you see it. Pick it up with, like, you know what? Get a bag of sand of some sort and Get, get Dee to touch it. Is Dee there? If you find Dee Are you still talking about the vase? The vase is not cursed. It's from the 1800s. It was a time of science. Jesus, Dee, why did you flush the toilet? Well, you had me all freaked out about spray and DNA evidence. W-What's going on with Mac and Charlie? It's-- I can't get them to stay focused. They keep escalating the conversation into evil curses and opening leather shops in Arizona. A leather shop in Arizona? Yeah. Well, they'd be out of business in a week's time. That's exactly what I said. We need to split 'em up. That's a good idea. How do you propose we do that? Hey, Charlie, hey, it's Dee. Listen, uh, how come Mac's the only one who gets to push the button on the walkie? Uh, let me get back to you on that. Where are you guys? I'm in a little girl's room. Frank, get back here. Mac and Charlie are gonna do a diversion. No way. The little bitch has got a suitcase. I'll bet the vase is in it. No, no, I doubt that. Yeah, yeah, at this point, I doubt that ts is even the family mentioned in the article. Frilly little dress, pink nightie. Holy hell. There's a teddy bear and it's got something hard in it. I'll bet the wife put the vase in the teddy bear to steal it from the husband. No, no, that is absolute insanity. I'm gonna gut this thing. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, n-n-no, Frank. Hi, I'm Albert, I love you. Hi, I'm Albert, I love you. Hi, I'm Albert, I love you. Shut up. Hi, I'm Albert, I love you. Shut, shut up. That is outrageous. That is an outrageous amount of noise. Hi, I'm Albert, I love you. That's loud. Okay, oh, I'll smother it. Frank, Frank, do not. Fra, stop it. Hi, I'm Albert, I love you. Hi, I'm Albert Are you kidding me? Goddamn it. How have we not been caught at this point? Hey, what's up, guys? Charlie, what are you doing here? I snuck in. Mac was, like, being a dick about the walkie-talkie. You know how, like, he wouldn't let me push the button and stuff? Dick. So he can just sneak in, but we can't seem to sneak out? It wasn't easy-- there's, like, a ton of clots in this house. I didn't know which closet you were in, okay? I had to look in a lot. All right, well, now that we've split you two idiots up, maybe we can finally get Mac to do a diversion. Hi, Mama, I'm home. Jesus Christ, now there's a kid in the house? Mac, dude, a kid just walked into the house-- a little heads up! Could you hold on one second, Dennis? Okay, so that's a double-double cheeseburger meal with a extra-large chocolate shake? Um, can you go ahead and throw an extra double cheeseburger on there, please? 'Cause I'm very hungry. Mac, now is not the time to run off and get a hamburger! We need your help! I didn't just run off, dude. I'm coming back. We need you to come back now. We need you to create a diversion. We have got to get out of this house! What happened to Charlie's diversion? Charlie doesn't know what a diversion is, apparently. He just ran directly into the house. Fine. I'll be right back. Okay, great, thank you. Hey, get chips this time. I'm not gonna get chips! He got mad at me for not Shut up. Well, you know what? I'll be a plumber. I'll knock on the front door, tell 'em I got a deal on pipes, you guys run out the back. That's a little elaborate, but okay. Ooh, I'll do a Swedish accent! No, you do not do a Swedish accent-- you don't know how to do one. And you don't need to, dude. These people don't know who you are! I can't just tell them that we're there to steal their artifact, Dennis. There is a huge amount of middle ground between those two things. I'm a Swedish plumber-- I'm here to fix your pipes. That's good. That's a good accent. Do a Philadelphia accent if you insist on doing an accent. I'm not going to do a Philadelphia accent. I'm gonna do a Swedish accent, because that's what Indy would do. Are you still there, Dennis, are you still there? Don't worry about it, and don't worry about anything. I'm gonna kill you. I'm gonna kill you! Well, guys, looks like we're on our own. Let's just make our move. Charlie, how'd you sneak in here? Front door. Let's just Front door? You just walked right in the front door? Well, I ran, I had a little hustle going, but yeah, front door. Mm-hmm. I'm beginning to think we should just walk right out the front door, then. I'm beginning to think that this family has zero awareness of their surroundings. Let's go. Let's just go. Oh, my God. So, tell me, Madison, do you like Disneyland? Yeah. Well, we are going there right now. Surprise! I already packed your suitcase. Did you pack Binky? Well, no, I packed Elbert. I don't want Elbert. I want Binky! Go grab your Binky and hurry up, 'cause we got to go! Frank, Frank! Frank! Little girl coming your way. I'm gonna whip this little bitch in the face if she makes a a peep. Binky? Binky? Binky! We are assholes. No one is planning to murder Jay Leno or anyone else. This is a nice woman planning a surprise California vacation. Dangerous family? No. Barry! What took you so long? Mom, how come Barry's here? Oh, well, uh, he's coming with us to Disneyland instead of Daddy. How'd you like it if we could go to Disneyland every day? Are we going to California? Without Daddy? Well, I'll be your new daddy. Uh-oh. Oh, my God, did you hear that? She's out there, and they're all going to Disneyland. Barry, I followed you, you son of a bitch. I knew something was up. You're my best friend! How could you do this to me? Do you still love me? I don't know anymore. It's not good when the kids get involved. Very sad. or so help me God, I will beat the hell out of you. Let's just make a break for it. Everybody shut up! Now, let's all just calm down, and we'll talk this thing out like a family. I don't care if it takes all night. Oh, God, no. All night? I can't do all night, you guys. I don't have it in me. Screw it. Let's just walk right out. They're not gonna notice; they got a lot on their Their marriage is falling apart. Let's walk right out. I'm just gonna walk right out. Let's do it. I've tried to make this work, but if you want to go, you can go. But you're not taking my little girl. Hello. Hey. Hello! I am the Swedish plumber Uh, Mac Hey, Frank, we're out here! Yo! Oh. The vase! Shit! All right, we'll just, uh Yeah, why don't we head out. Should've sideways We should just Thank you. It was weird that they were Asian, right?                       Attention! Attention, everyone! Gather round, please! Gather round! Mac has a very important announcement! Because of my sudden and unfortunate weight loss, the bar is now in extreme risk. And as head of security, this concerns me. So Mac's made a couple of moves. And that first move is this. SWEET DEE: Jesus Christ. Jesus. Perfect for ocular pat-downs. Now I can determine a subject's threat level without him being able to feel my retinal assessment. Which is a great advantage because the guy can't see how scared Mac is. Yes, and No, that's not what it's about. It's not Huh? Oh, I thought that you were scared every time you went to go to That's classified! Look, this whole point is to make them feel safer, all right? We don't feel safer. And, Mac, there will never come a time where you will need those. Mark my words, Dennis, there will come a time when I will utilize these glasses to assess a threat and then Are they still standing there? No, they walked away. My peripheral is a little compromised. Yeah, you can't see out the sides, and that's a disadvantage, so Oh, good you're all here. Who invited the Jew lawyer? Not Jewish. Hold on, punk. He's clear. He's clear. You know, I-I really do not understand you people. You know, it's funny, most of the time I'm trying to get away from you, and yet when I really need to get in touch with you, I can't get you to return my phone calls. Mmm, don't need you, don't care. Eh out you go. Lovely. As the executor of your mother's estate, I'm here to inform you that her father, Heinrich Landgraf, has fallen into a coma. Pop-Pop? He's being kept alive by a respirator. As per the will, the only living blood relatives, the ever-charming Dee and Dennis Reynolds are the only people empowered to decide whether or not he stays on those machines. Are you saying that we have to decide whether that old Nazi bitch lives or dies? There's that charm. That is correct. I'll await your decision. Pop-Pop's room's right down here. How do you know, Frank? I come here every week and feed him soup, take care of him. That's nice of you, you know? Help a man keep his dignity in his final years. Somebody's got to do it. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh, Jesus Christ! Ugh! I didn't have a chance to tidy. T Tidy? Frank, the man is rotting. Oh, God, why hasn't someone done something in here? I told the staff I got it. You don't got it. You don't have it at all. Yeah, what is the overwhelming smell? Oh, that's the soup. Yeah, well, if he doesn't finish, sometimes I leave 'em for him, and then I forget and then months go by. Jesus Christ, Frank, what the hell is really going on here? Look, the guy always said he had Nazi treasure stashed away. I figure I spend some time with him, he gives it to me. All right, well, pretty good plan; execution leaves a lot to be desired. Okay, well, speaking of execution, we're just gonna pull the plug on this creep and get out of here, right? Whoa. Whoa, h-hold on a second, Dee, I mean, that's a big decision. How so? We're talking about taking a man's life. Yeah, but he was a Nazi, so it's kind of, like, eh Well, yeah, I get that, but, I mean, he was our grandfather. Okay, maybe we got to think this through a little bit more. Yeah. Oh, my God, make a decision already! Are you eating the soup?! Is he eating the soup? Yes. I'm sorry. I was hungry. I made a decision to eat the soup. I didn't sit around thinking all day, "Hey, do I do this? Do I not do this?" We are making a decision about whether or not to take a man's life, not whether or not to eat old rancid soups. Okay, listen, I think we just need to gather a little bit more information before we make our decision, right? Yeah, you guys think it over, think it over. Mac, can you come here for a second? What? All Frank's talk about Nazi treasure got me thinking about something. Okay, you remember that box of stuff Pop-Pop gave me a few years ago? It was, like, all this old stuff, Nazi shit that he got from the war? Holy shit! Yeah. Didn't we burn that all in the alley? Not all of it. There was a painting in that box, a very special dog painting that I mounted on my wall. You and my dad share this futon? Now, Frank hated this painting, you know? He made me take it down. I do not like this painting, Charlie. Its smug aura mocks me. It's evil, Charlie. Evil. And it's been in that box ever since. Uh-huh. So what? By the way, man, this is why we work well together, you know? You see free soup, you make a decision to eat it. It's horrible. It's terrible soup, but we got to stick with our decisions, right? Yeah, I can't go back on it now. No, no. All right, anyway do you think that that painting could've been the Nazi treasure that Frank's looking for? Mm. I've made a decision. Yes. Yes, right? Yeah. Okay. You got to help me find it. Let's slip out of here so they don't notice. Okay. They're standing two feet away from us, so they are gonna notice, but let's just run out of here; they'll think we made a quick decision to leave. Damn it, dude! All right, I remember exactly what happened, all right? Frank took it down, told me to get rid of it; I stashed it away somewhere, but then what-what happened to it from there, I don't know. Hey, Charlie, come here. Dude, you got to check this out. Look at all these old photos of Hitler with German shepherds. Oh, holy shit. Yeah. But check this out. Oh, my God! Yeah. Hitler painted German shepherds all the time. He was, like, obsessed. Dude, I'm thinking that maybe that painting could be An original Hitler. Yes! Yeah! Holy shit, dude, this is huge! We are gonna become famous treasure hunters. I'm thinking, Hollywood is gonna make a Da Vinci Code style thriller about us! I can finally be Indiana Jones! Yeah, yeah, and then I get it back on my wall! Yeah. Well, we're not gonna put it back up on your wall. It'll probably go in a museum. What? No-no-no-no-no. It looks so good here. It belongs in a museum, and that's the end of this. Okay, you know what, can you call Frank? Because he's gonna remember the details. I knew that I stashed it away somewhere, but it's-it's gone. I can't find it. Do we have to involve Frank? You know what, yeah, we'll just tiptoe around the language. I'll play it cool. Just play it cool. Mac! Hey, Frank. Where are you? You sound strained. I'm stuck in a window over at Pop-Pop's house. I got to find this treasure. Treasure, what treasure? I don't even know what you're talking about. There probably is no treasure. I'll bet you there's no treasure, so you can just stop looking for the treasure, okay, 'cause there's no treasure. Hey, man, you know where that, um, worthless old dog painting that you had hanging up in your apartment- do you know where that might be? The dog painting? Oh! That was evil. I threw that thing out. I'm pretty sure I saw Cricket scampering away with it. Cricket? Hey, listen, Mac. You do me a favor. I'm really stuck in this window. Will you come and get me? Okay, nice. We got to get Cricket. I know just where to find him. Dust is a nice touch. Yes. I don't like you wearing the glasses, though. They're supposed to assess a threat. Oh, Cricket could be a threat. No, I have cleared him on multiple occasions. Here we go. Hello! Hey, Cricks. Dog pound, huh? Weird. Wow. Oh! Ugh. Ooh. Oh, Jesus Christ, that's gruesome. Yeah, I got into a skirmish with a stray chocolate lab. I won't go into details, but suffice to say, that dog is very paralyzed now. Anyway, they got me doing this, uh, this community service thing. Yeah, but I'm kind of a dog executioner, so, uh, looks like old Cricket got the last laugh. Wow. Yeah. You're putting the dogs down? Well, uh, no. You know, yeah, mostly just, you know, cleaning up the poops, you know, washing out their cages, that kind of thing. Ah. Sounds like you're a dog janitor then. Yeah, that's more like they got the last laugh. Cricks, Frank said you know something about a dog painting that he threw away that you might have scampered off with. Yeah, worthless dog painting. Yeah, yeah, dog painting, sure, yeah. Oh, very evil vibes. Yeah, I sold it. To who? Hmm? Oh, some guy. You know, he's coming down here, he's all bent out of shape, you know, that he had to put down his German shepherd. Well, I notice his dog looks just like the one in the painting. I see an opportunity. Make three bucks. Ba-da-boom! Wait. He's cool. He's not a threat. Phew! I know he's not a threat! I told you, I've assessed him I've just cleared him. You are not using the glasses correctly, and it's driving me crazy, okay? I thought I used it. Could you tell how scared I was? No, I could not. I could not. Mara? Uh, yeah, boss. Got a mastiff in here, just had explosive diarrhea. I've never seen anything like it. Get your ass in here. Come on. Hello? Somebody there? Help me out of here! I'm stuck! I can't get out of here! Frank? What is happening? What are you doing? I'm trapped. That goddamn trunk is booby-trapped. It's not booby-trapped, Frank; it's an empty trunk, and you fell into it like a Weeble wobble. Let's go. Come on. Jesus! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh, God. Frank, there's no point in you looking for a treasure, okay? If there's anything of value in this house, we are the ones who inherit it once he dies. You're wasting your time. I mean, it's crazy. Dennis, check out these old films- "New Years '74," "Thanksgiving '68." Way. "Summer Camp '81." '81? Oh, that's us. That's our summer camp. Yeah, that's us. Yeah. Fire that up. I want to check that out. Oh, see, Frank, Dee and I have been talking, and I don't think we're gonna I don't think we're gonna off Pop-Pop. You know, I mean, yeah, sure, the guy's got a little bit of a sordid past, absolutely, but you know, everybody deserves a second chance. Yeah, he was just following orders. You know what I mean? Yeah. Let's not try and justify why a man would join the Nazis and Right. Right, right, right, yeah, I see what you're saying. 'Cause that's gonna get us too far away from We won't be able to the point that we're trying to make, which is that the man moved to America, you know, to put all that horrible shit behind him. Right. Right. And he wanted to turn his life around, and that's what he did, Frank. He turned his life around. People do that. People do that. Exactly. Oh, here we go. Look at me. Oh! Oh, God, you remember that car? Yes. Oh, look at those two little rug rats. Oh, I was so cute! Oh, man, and look at Pop Look at how sweet he is! Yeah, God, he was a sweet guy. This is great. That's the camp. Oh, we loved it there. God, it's it's all flooding back to me now. Did we wear those uniforms? I don't remember those. Do you? I don't remember that. But yeah, see if there's sound. I want to I'd like to pop some sound on. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Look at this guy. Remember this guy? Ah. I totally remember that guy. He was always so jazzed up about everything. He was so excited, and he would get us all excited, do you remember that? Get the whole crowd jazzed up, the whole camp. Here we go. That is why it is so important that we all must unify. The more we come together, the stronger we become. Now, listen close, kids. These goddamn niggers and Jews are trying to take over this country, and we've got to take it back! Oops. Yeah. That just took a turn. Sieg heil! Sieg heil! Sieg heil! Oh, that's us. Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm doing that. Sieg heil! Sieg heil! Sieg Okay, that settles it. Let's fry this turkey. Yes. All set? Ready? Whoa, whoa, hang on. Hang on a second. Are you sure you want to watch him die? What do you mean, watch him die? We have to watch him die? Well, you do something like pull the plug, and you got to stay there until the lights go out. You know, maybe we need to experience that on a smaller scale first, and just kind of see how we feel about it? Kill something less important first. See what that does inside. Move up. I have an idea. You want to watch a dog get put down? Yeah, we want to see how it feels. Great. I got just the one. Ah, I feel like we need to pick the dog. You know what I mean? 'Cause we need to feel the full weight of the decision. Mm-hmm. Okay, fine. No. Oh, no. Come on. No. Uh no. Oh. No! Oh. Come on, guy. No! Pick me? What? Put me down! Pick me! I deserve it. Okay. New plan. We're doing the right thing, Dennis. We're not killers. You know what I mean? No, we have to think about ourselves here. I don't want to live with pulling the plug on somebody. No. Let's just let Pop-Pop and Cricket and these dogs die as nature intended. Slowly and painfully. Mm-hmm. All right. All right, guys. Here we go. All right, everybody. Go, get out of here. Go and be free. Go and be free. Oh, we're all free. There we go. Go on. We're all free. Yeah. I'm one of you guys. All right, so this is the address. All right. This is the spot, huh? Here. Okay. "Bret Da Lawyer, a Denial Correlation." What does that mean? Pretty good. That's close. It's "Brett DeLauter, a Dental Corporation." Guy's a dentist. Huh. All right, let's check it out. Yeah. Whoa. Wow. Oh, shit. Mac, look. There it is. Oh. Holy shit, this dentist must have gone insane after his dog died. I mean, look at this. Charlie, I'm beginning to think that we may have stumbled onto one of the greatest discoveries of modern times. Follow me here. What if the key to Adolf Hitler's madness was the death of his dog? What? Okay, when he was a kid, he had this little, sweet, little puppy, and he was the happiest chap in all of Germany. Right, "I love chocolate. I love my dogs." Yeah, but then his beloved pet was ripped from him, and he was like, "That's it. I'm totally going to kill everybody, take over the world." That is what happened. I mean, that's definitely what happened. Oh, hi, you must be Mr. Miller. No. Yeah. Ready for those braces? Yeah, but I wanted the Yeah, we can go in. Yeah. We can pop in real quick. Yep. Dude, I'm telling you, this is like The Da Vinci Code. Oh, man, I wonder who's going to play me. I was thinking maybe Mark Wahlberg. What do you think? Hmm, no, you're right, he couldn't match my intensity. Ryan Gosling-- it's locked in. It's gonna be Ryan Gosling. I can't wait to get that painting back up on my wall. You know what I mean? That's what this is really all about when you think about it. No, that's not what this is about. This is about ripping open the fabric of historical fact and making a film about it starring Ryan Gosling as Mac. Okay, well, I'll play Hitler, then. That'd be cool. What are you talking about? I play Hitler in the movie. Okay, Hitler's not even in it. It takes place in present day. Oh, it could be a time- traveling thing. I see what you're saying. So then Hitler comes back from the past, he joins us on our adventure, we go on a big caper together. There's no, there's no time travel in this movie. It's gonna be a classic like Citizen Kane. Time travel movies are classic. This is gonna be-- this is You're driving me-- oh, my God. What? Mac, I need you to convince Dennis and Deandra not to pull the plug on Pop-Pop. Why? Because I haven't found his treasure yet. I need more time. Okay, Frank, here's the deal. Pop-Pop does have treasure, and I'll let you in on it if you help me because Charlie is driving me bananas. He's becoming a threat to this whole operation. Then you're going to have to take him out of the picture. Get rid of him. Yes, sir. Hey, Charlie, you know, I was thinking, maybe you could play Hitler. Of course. I think you've got the range. I know I do, Mac. And I think you're right. I mean, the leader of the Third Reich defying laws of physics to join us in our present-day adventure- that makes sense. It's a better movie. Good call. Yeah, I've also decided to direct. Mm-hmm, let's lock that in. Yeah, is that? What is-- what are you doing? Why are you doing that? Hmm? Oh, I am so happy that you have decided to end this. As soon as we get this little issue resolved, I'll no longer have a legal obligation to deal with you. Yeah, it's not really resolved, I think, in the sense that you were hoping for. No. When we said we were gonna end this, we didn't mean "kill." Not end it. What are you talking about? We're not going to do it. We're not going to do it. We, we don't want a man's death on our hands. Okay, listen, you don't want the man's blood on your hands, you don't want to give the order, then, fine, I'll give. Just grant me power of attorney, and I'll give the order myself. You would do that? Oh, absolutely. Let's do it. Perfect. I'm telling you, Frank, Gosling has got to be the one because he's the only one that can handle my intensity. God, you're obsessed with Ryan Gosling. Well, no, I just think Charlie? Mac, you know the best thing about time travel movies? They're full of surprises. Oh. Beautiful painting you've got there. Too bad it's the wrong one. Huh? That's not this is the painting. You got the wrong painting. I don't know, they look exactly alike. Silence, fools. This has gone on long enough. This painting clearly causes madness in men. And it must be destroyed. Charlie, no, no destroying that painting. That's a piece of history. That's the key to Hitler's madness. Oh, this? Come on. I painted this. What? I painted it and I loved it, so I saw an opportunity to get it back, but now I'm realizing that this painting is making us all crazy-- crazy. Hitler's painting, the key to the Holocaust, Ryan Gosling playing you? Ridiculous. This has to end now, and so I have the final solution. I'm going to burn this painting and you can't stop me. We won't. What? Dude, if that's not an original Hitler, then who gives a shit? Yeah. Oh, yeah, all right. Did you like my whole, my whole thing I was doing there? Huh? I need final verbal confirmation. Yes, just do it already. Wow, what an asshole, huh, Doctor? You are killing a man. You know that, right? There's a lot of mercy in this decision. I commend it. Oh, you commend-- well, you know, I mean, technically we gave the order to him to, to give to you, so Yeah, if you feel like commending- if you're in the mood for commending, you could Right, if you're gonna throw some commendations around, you know, just We'll take 'em. Okay. Wow. Uh-oh, here we go. What is that? Uh, he seems to be breathing on his own. That happens sometimes. Uh, how long until he's not breathing on his own? Until he perishes? Right. Could be months, weeks, days. Who knows? He's a fighter, this one. Son of a bitch. Well, if you'll excuse me, we've had an incredible amount of stray dog attacks all over the city, so our E.R. is slammed. Hmm. Well, you know what? It's okay, let's go. He had nothing of value to leave us anyway. Yeah, come on. Well, actually he did. Burn, baby, burn. Dude, I'm still psyched about this movie. Okay, the ending needs a little bit of work 'cause nobody cares about an original Charlie Kelly. Well, it's not an original, you know. I just painted over one of the old paintings that he gave me, so Who? Pop-Pop. So Pop-Pop did give you the painting? Well, it was in the box of junk that he gave me, but it's just trash. That's an even worse ending. It's so complicated. I can't even follow the goddamn story. I-I don't care. Dude, Gosling. Gosling will not play you!                        SWEET DEE: I cannot believe how bad it's gotten back here. DENNIS: We should have gone in the front. MAC: The front's worse. Oh, God, it stinks so bad! I can't believe the trashmen can strike in this economy. It's unbelievable. It should be against the law. Is all of this our trash? We generate a ton of it. It's a sad throwaway culture we're living in. Mm, it's true. I feel like you guys have done something like that before? Have we? Shut up, bird. (Dennis laughs) It's just not that funny. CHARLIE: Uh, look out. Ooh! Whoa! What are you doing, keeping trash in here?! Take it outside. There's no more room outside. FRANK: Can you believe these trash bozos? They make $20 an hour and they want more? That's an outrage! These guys are blasting us in the ass. Yeah, I mean, we pay their salaries, and they turn around and ass-blast us? Come on. What are you talking about? You don't pay taxes. You don't even vote. Who am I supposed to vote for, the Republican who's blasting me in the ass or the Democrat who's blasting me in the ass? Yeah, politics is all one big ass-blast. This doesn't all sound familiar to you guys? If these jerks don't want to do their job, I say we do it for 'em. The trash business is a gold mine. Yeah, Frank's right. Let's pull up our bootstraps, oil up a couple asses and do a little plowing of our own. Pow! Not gay sex. Okay, yeah. It seemed like What are you talking about? We're gonna solve the trash crisis. Oh! All of this, I've heard all of this before. No? Shut up, bird. (both laugh) All right, it's a simple plan. Matt, Dennis, Charlie, you rent the van, you drive to rich people's homes, you tell them that you'll pick up the trash for a fee. Then you take the trash to a dump in New Jersey where there's no strike. Meanwhile, I dress Dee up like a whore, get a city official, bribe him, and make him give us the contract, undermining the trash unions. Any questions? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Charlie. We've gone to door-to-door in a van before, and that didn't work out for us. This is gonna work, trust me. Mac? I think it's gonna be hard to hang off the back of a van like the trash guys do. Can we just get a trash truck? No, you don't want to be caught scabbing. Get a van. Dennis? I don't want to be a trashman. I'll bribe the city official with you. I need a lady whore. Dee? Yeah, I've done the whore thing before. I don't care for it. I won't be doing it again. The whore thing worked. You just didn't listen to me. How many times have we done this kind of thing before? A lot. We've done things. We've done stuff like this all the time. Yeah, once or twice. And how often do they work out? Well, come on. It doesn't always work out. How often should it work out? Almost never. That's because you don't listen to me. This time we do it my way. Okay, I'm a little confused. So, Frank is the brains and you're just the looks now? And I'm still the wild card, so that's good. No, no, guys, we're forsaking the group dynamic, okay? And truthfully, Charlie, come on. I mean, (sighs) nobody wants a wild card, okay? It doesn't make any sense. We don't want a maniac in our group. There's no benefit to it. Mm-hmm. Uh, I feel like you just agreed with me, but you weren't listening to what I was saying. Yes. You pointed at me like I said something, but I didn't. Oh, good. Charlie, having somebody making wild decisions that make no sense, that benefits nobody. Oh, yes. Right, yes. Is he listening to us? I can't tell. He's listening. He's not understanding. Yeah, he doesn't even like, get us, man. It's We're talking about you. Oh. Okay, let's move on from it. What do you think is happening right now? Guys, it doesn't matter. It's good. We'll sort this out later. It doesn't matter, guys, because I have no love for this plan. I just don't want to be a trashman. Yeah, and guys, if I'm being honest, there's no way that I can hang off one of the back of these, just simply no way. Yeah, what would you hang onto? Let's bail on plan. Let's bail on it. I don't want to do it. Wait, wait, but that's the whole thing, right? We can't just quit. Like, we have to see Frank's plan all the way through. That's what he wants us to do. Okay, all right, fine. We'll do Frank's plan. But I think I have a tweak that is gonna solve both of our problems. This is what I'm talking about, Charlie. Oh, yeah. See, we're still doing Frank's plan; we're just improving on it. Yeah, we absolutely. Look, the man's got good plans. It's the specifics are outdated. They're old You know? They're very outdated. Yeah, sure, in the 1950s, yeah, you could drive around door to door in a windowless van, and people didn't think they were gonna get raped. Now, th-they will think that. Yeah. This is better. I know, and plus with the tuxedos, you know, honestly, who wouldn't want their trashman in a tuxedo? Absolutely. I know I would. There's plenty of room in the back for the trash. You know, the real trashmen don't know we're scabbing. Good plan. It's a good plan. Wonder how Max is doing back there. I can't believe you never listen to me. You're supposed to look like a whore. The whore-politician is outdated, Frank. That is an idea that's best left in the trash. I am presenting myself as a powerful lady. You're presenting yourself as a banana. Okay, you know what, I'm here and I'm doing your plan. I'm just doing it my way. Well, at least sex it up a little bit. Open some buttons. I don't want to. Stop it. Get off me! Show some skin. Stop it, Frank! St Oh, great! This is nice. This doesn't look powerful or sexy. Now it looks good. Great job, Frank! Sorry, sorry, sorry. I'm running a little bit late. Now, I understand that you guys wanted to get a bid to undermine the waste manag I know you guys. Oh, shit. This ain't gonna work. You know this guy? It's the gay guy who wanted to buy Paddy's. Oh, yeah, you fired me from the Oldies Rock CafÃ©. Huh, I did not picture this guy getting recycled back into the mix. So much for the sex appeal angle. I don't know, Frank, why don't you sex it up a little? What do you mean? Get off. Get off of me, get off of me. Why don't you sex it? How about you be the whore? How about you be the whore, huh? Get off me. Why don't you show some skin? Please Stop it. Get off of me. Huh? He likes it like that. Stop it. Oh, do it, show some skin. Knock it off, you lousy bitch. Stop it! (panting) What are you doing? Uh you like what you see? Hmm?  I still got the moves  (humming) Okay. Now, guys, we've done something like this before, so we should be able to do it better this time around. Right. Now, right off the bat, Charlie, were you planning on doing an accent of any kind? Yes. Me, too. You guys were both planning on doing accents. Yeah. Of course. Let's not do accents. That's the kind of wild-card stuff that always gets us into trouble. All right, you know what? Let's put all of our cards on the table. Were you guys planning anything else? I have a knife. Why do you have a knife? Uh, to make sure that the plan works. Could be good. Okay. The plan's gonna work. Give me the knife. All right. Should I have the knife? I should have the knife. Somebody should have the knife. I'm afraid that if I don't have the knife, then one of you will stab somebody. And again, that's a wild card thing; we don't want that. Right. That's what we're trying to get rid of, right? Right. We don't want that. Right, right, right, right Right, exactly. So why don't and also, why don't you guys let me do the talking? Well, hold hang on. You know, 'cause now you're look, you've done talking before, and that hasn't always worked. It hasn't worked because you guys are always interrupting me. We were always what? I'll talk! I'll talk. Mac, you have an exceptional number of bugs in your teeth. You're gonna want to rinse those out; it's disgusting. Bugs? Yes, bugs. Yeah, yeah. Is that what that is? Yeah. If you're going to ride back there, ride with your mouth shut, man. All right, listen. I think I have a tweak where none of us does the talking. (doorbell rings)  Hello   Hello   Hello   We bet you hate that smell   That small   That smell from all your trash   Your trash   We bet you'd like three charming men to take your trash from you   From you   We have a limousine   A limousine   A limousine   That we can fill fill with trash   So please let us take your trash from you Wait, I have to stop you. Damn it, Dennis. I knew this wasn't gonna work. No, the plan was good. Charlie, you were sharp. I was You were a little sharp. Guys, guys, the song was fine. Did you say you would take my trash? Yeah. Yeah, that's (laughs) Oh, my How much will it cost? Oh, we didn't, um $200 Oh, that's fantastic. Can we start now? Yeah! Yeah, sure. One more time with the song? No thank you. Just the trash. I knew I wasn't sharp. Let's go. All right, let's do it, boys. So how does this place tickle your fancy? Why are we here? Because you are a power bottom. He's a what? A power bottom. I'm not having this conversation. What do you want? We can pick up the trash for half the price of the union. We want city contract. Look, there's no way you're going to undermine one of the biggest unions in the city. Moreover, both sides are incredibly close to an agreement. So Well, you see anything you like here? Maybe we can hook it up and change your mind. May I please leave? I don't get it. We take you to a titty bar and you say no to us. We bring you to this place with all these juicy dongs, and you shut us down. What team are you playing for? Hold on a second, Frank. I think I know what's going on here. This man has been realigned. He's a yestergay. What's a yestergay? A lot of men bounce around from label to label never quite finding their proper gay home. My hunch is that this gentleman has gone from a twink to a twunk to a twank. What's a twunk? Twink and a hunk. A twink with muscles, but still hairless. So smooth. Oh, incredibly smooth. A twank on the other hand. Twank is no good. That's a twink and a skank. Essentially a ragdoll, just being passed around from twink to twunk to bear to otter. Wait a minute, wait a minute. What's an otter? Subsection of bear. Still hairy, but where a bear generates his power through sheer mass alone, the otter generates his power through extraordinary quickness, cunning, and skill. That is a lot to keep in your head to maintain a lifestyle. It's very difficult to maintain the lifestyle of a twank versatile 'cause this this often leads to a lot of self-hatred and denial, especially among the religious or political types. So they try and realign their sexual orientation through therapy. So he's not gay anymore? Well, that's a hotly debated topic, isn't it? I, for one, am of the belief that some things can't be thrown in the trash, Frank. And your sexuality is one of them. I totally agree. Some cocks can't be unsucked. So is it a case of forgetting, or is it denying? Neither. Still gay. You still here? I thought you'd be gone by now. I can't. You're pointing a gun at me. Oh, I forgot. (uncocks gun) Well, I guess we'll be the ones to slink away. Dee (all laugh) Whoo! All right. Are you guys having fun? Yeah! This is my dream. Are you guys loving this or what? Great, because I'm not. Me neither. Yeah, I'm not loving it. You know, I used to love trash, but this is just not how I wanted this to go. No, not at all. Look, yes, we're making lots of money, and that's great, but our tuxes are ruined and our limousine is covered in trash and seagulls. (gull caws) The gulls are shitting all over me. Oh, look, we've essentially become garbagemen. That's what I was trying to avoid. Guys, can I make a suggestion? Hmm? I don't want to do Frank's plan anymore, so I say we just quit right now. Let's quit it. Yeah, but I still have a lot of energy Me too. and I would like to take one of our old plans out of the trash and recycle it. You want to sell gas door-to-door? I've been thinking it the entire time. That's what I was thinking. Are you kidding me? I've totally been thinking about that. See, 'cause we're like Ya, ta, ta, ta ta! Our friendship is like It's strong. We'd never blow that up. That can't be trashed. Never throw that out. Guys, that gas idea was a great idea, and it was trashed long before it should've been trashed. Yeah, I have one more suggestion. Yeah? Instead of taking that all the way to New Jersey let's just dump it in a poor neighborhood because they don't mind living in their own filth. Absolutely. They don't know any better. I mean, why else would they choose to live like that? They don't care? They clearly don't care. Let's do it. Guys, the boys are back in town. The boys are back in town. The boys are back in town. Uh!  The boys are back in town Oh He just tried to kiss me. Yeah, he did a little bit.  The boys are back in town  (applause) Brothers, I got some good news: we're going back to work. (cheers) The new contract is being finalized as we speak. Now, of course, we had to make a few compromises. FRANK: What kind of compromises? Um, well, there were certain issues that we had to deal with. Issues? Certain? Give me that. Brothers, I don't know about you, but I can't understand this college boy's language. Am I right? We gotta have it in plain English. Okay, sir, I was just getting to that. He was just getting to that. He's trying to confuse us with his fancy language and his expensive podiums, but we know the truth. MAN: I don't. Look, just let me finish. This contract is bullshit. We gotta keep the strike going. MAN: Would you please just let him finish his sentence? But he's lying to us. But he hasn't said anything yet. Yeah, well, he's lying anyway. Hey, y'all, it's me, Martina Martinez. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Give it to me. Give it to me. These white boys is crazy, right? Youse about to get screwed by your city and your union, as well. Okay, ma'am, if you just give me the mic, please Rape! Rape! Rape! Oh, my This white boy's got his hands all over my beautiful brown body! Thank you. Now, why is it that my Latino and my proud African brothers got to be doing all the work while these cracker-ass bitches doing the negotiating? (crowd murmurs agreement) What are you doing? Just go with it. Let me ask you something. Why we got to be the trashmen and the maids and the gardeners, hmm? Yeah! Why we got to live next to the trash dumps and the ghettos? We deserve better! Yeah! When was the last time a white lady pick up after you when you threw your orange soda and your grape sodas on the ground?! You're losing them. Uh, well, there's-there's Well, hold on a second! What's happening over here?! Oh, my God! The white upper-class man has no respect for us! They're dumping their trash in our neighborhood!  So buy our classy gasoline (Charlie scatting) We got to go get them! Yeah! (clamoring) (Sweet Dee shouting) Go get them! Go get them! Let's go get them! Let's go! Hang on a second. What's this all about? (clamoring continues) Now, that looks to me like some sort of swarming mob. Yeah, I know. What are they so angry about though? I don't know. Something bad's about to happen to somebody. (laughter) (clamoring continues) Is it us? Yep. Yeah. Go, go, go. Get in. (clamoring continues) Don't dump your trash in our neighborhood, you rich prick! Sorry! Sorry! Right. No to the contract! Right? Right? No to the contract! What the hell were you guys doing dumping down there? Look, it would've been fine if Dee hadn't incited a race war. How was I supposed to know it was you guys? We were going back to the old gas plan, okay? Why? Why don't you do my plan? Why couldn't you guys just grease that city council guy? I mean, so what if he's gay, you know? He zigs, you zag. I would've gotten the contract. Can we just forget about the whole thing, please? Let's just forget about it. Can I get a beer? Yeah, I'm on it. I don't want to talk about it either. Let me have a beer. Yeah. Yeah, beer me, beer me. Yes, beers! (Dennis sighs)   (Frank grunting) We should get rugs for the bar. We should make rugs for the bar. Make them? I got a rug guy. We could put on a show where we play rug salesmen. That's a good idea. That would attract a great amount of attention. No, no way. What, no, what?! Guys, we give up way too easily. Let me just jump onto the next thing? What? That's insane. Look, all we have to do is make a couple adjustments, and this plan can still work. Dennis, if you want to be classy and you're g-good with city councilmen and you think you can get him, great. Be classy and bang the guy. Go get him. I'll get him, but I'm not going to bang him. He's a twink versatile. You watch yourself. Ooh, I wouldn't be able to satisfy him. A twink versatile? That's impressive. Look, the point is, we got to learn from our mistakes, right? You know, make a couple adjustments. Let's solve this trash crisis. (tires screeching) Okay, when we arrive, Dennis will do all of the talking, Frank and I will handle the refuse, and Dee will take the wheel. Then we can strap me onto the back for the rest of the day. Everybody's happy. Yeah, guys, I can't believe it, but I think this might actually work. See, all we had to do was learn from our mistakes and then work together. Everyone got to contribute something to the group as a whole. What did you contribute? Try the brakes. Try the Did you cut the brakes again? Yep. Oh, Charlie. Why would you do that, Charlie? That's just what I do. Wild card, bitches! What? Yee-ha! (Dennis and Sweet Dee screaming) Oh, my We have no brakes. Oh, God! Oh, my God! What are you doing, what? That's that. Whew, good call of getting those brakes fixed, Mac. Yeah, I saw that coming a mile away. All right, now that we got rid of our wild card, we can actually see this thing through. So, we good? Oh, yeah, this is gonna be easy money. Grab some trash, you bitches. (Dennis laughs) I'm telling you, this is gonna be great. I feel like this is gonna work, I think. (vehicle approaches, horn honks) Guess the strike's over. Goddamn it. So, the rugs? Yeah, the rugs. Well, yeah, the rugs. Yeah, it's always been the rugs. Rugs are a great idea. Of course it's rugs. It's always been the rugs. We should get a billboard.                     Oh, God! Run! Where are you guys?! What's happening?! Over here! Over here! Frank! Where are you? Frank! Charlie! Oh, my God! Over here. We're all here?! We're all here?! Guys! Stop! Stop where you are! You four got some explaining to do. I got 15 different wedding guests out there with various degrees of injury. I got a groom-- face is half gone! And I'm still missing a bride. I don't know what happened back there, but we are innocent. We're completely innocent. Yeah, well, you four bozos are the only people on the scene that weren't invited. So you can see how bad this looks. Now, who is Mr. Dennis Reynolds? Oh, that's me. Hmm, hello, Dennis. Those are some interesting marks on your neck. Let me guess. Ex-wife's getting remarried, you get a little jealous. Get your buddies together, you decide to break up that party. So you crash the wedding, get a little tipsy, things take a violent turn. No, no, no, look. That is the exact opposite of what I wanted to happen. I wanted to make sure that that wedding happened! Why is Maureen getting married in the middle of the woods? I don't know. Some people find the woods romantic, I guess. And why get married on Friday the 13th? It's a monster day. I don't know and I don't care. I just want to make sure the wedding happens. I'm tired of paying alimony. Well, we got your back, bro. Don't worry about that. I don't need you to have my back. Three people crashing a wedding-- it's gonna make a scene. Why couldn't you just let me do this alone? Just don't like getting bussed up there. I feel like we're gonna be trapped. I don't, I don't like any of this. Oh, no. No, no. I don't like this place already. This is a strange place, right? I'm seeing a lot of bats. Yeah, there's bats everywhere. You know why? 'Cause it's Friday the 13th. No, no, no, stop. Will you stop with that? It's not because it's Friday the 13th. We're in the woods. Stop being paranoid. Still, this is creepy. I mean, who gets married in a spot like this? Oh, Jesus Christ! You guys crashing my wedding? Wait. What?! You?! Wait, Liam, you're marrying Maureen? Big-time. Don't be jelly. What the hell is going on here? What's your angle? Oldest angle in the book, my friend. Love. I don't buy this, okay? I thought you were in love with Ryan. What's your brother think about all this? Ryan's dead to me. Do you hear me? He's dead! So, I take it he doesn't approve? That's a negative, Ronald McDonald. Now, I'd ask you guys to leave, but I'm just too damn happy. See you bitches on the dance floor. I don't like this, okay? This is a McPoyle-Ponderosa wedding. This is, this is bad. Look, look, if you're gonna be here, I need your support. You need to help me make sure this wedding goes off without a hitch. Hold on. What made you think this wasn't gonna happen? Mac had heard there were some people there who wanted to ruin the wedding. Who? Him. Ah! That is bullshit! I was there to support my buddy. That was a swervy road. Yeah. What are you guys doing here? Oh, my God, I knew it. You're here to break up this wedding. What are you talking about? I'm here to support my friend, Bill Ponderosa. I'm his AA sponsor! Bullshit! You two love the fact that I have to pay alimony the rest of my life. You love the power you have over me with this financial burden. You know what, Dennis, not everything is about you, okay? I am here to support Frank. No, you two are here to make a scene. Oh! If anybody's making a scene, it's you! Ow! Ow! I just got tagged by a bat! He got you. I got tagged! Suck out the poison, Dee! I'm not sucking on your head. Suck it out! I'll give you $200, you suck it out. $200? I'll do it! Whoa, whoa, whoa! I'll do it for $200. Suck it quick. What are you? This is the kind of thing that I was talking about! Suck it harder! Go home, please! Suck it harder! I got it. Did you swallow it?! Of course I swallowed. Make yourself throw up! Yeah, you swallowed the poison! Get it out! Get it out! Vomit! Vomit! What are you doing?! There is no poison from a bat! No! You are gonna ruin this! You're all gonna ruin this! You all right? It won't come, Frank. Deandra. Yeah? Let's go break up this wedding. Whoa, stop, stop! So you were there to break up the wedding. Shit. Did I just say that part? Yeah. Why did you want to break up the wedding? For all the things he just said. That was accurate. But it wasn't just our idea to break up the wedding. Not at first. Last week, we had a visitor at the bar. They have to be stopped. The McPoyle bloodline's been pure and clean for a thousand years. This marriage is an abomination. Now, when you say "pure and clean ," uh, you mean what, exactly? Means we haven't bred outside the bloodline. For a thousand years? Yeah. That makes a lot of sense. Dennis knows Maureen better than anyone. Only he can talk her out of this. The last thing Dennis wants to do is break up this wedding. But we do. Okay, I brought a disguise. Meh! They're gonna know who you are. This will work. Now sneak me in so we can go kill Maureen. Kill? Who said anything about killing anybody? No one's killing anyone. We'll sneak you in to Liam so you guys can talk or bang or whatever it is you want to do. Frank! Frank! Oh, thank God you're here, man. I am not gonna make it. I am itching to get blitzed. Weddings are a big trigger for me, man. Why are you telling me this? You're my sponsor, Frank. Come on. My support system. Oh, right, right, right. Of course. So, do whatever you feel is best. Well, I feel it would be best if I pounded a beer. I'll support that decision. I wish I could. I mean, it's a dry wedding, for God's sakes. They're serving milk. I feel like maybe I should do some drugs then, you know? That bad? You earned it. Yeah. You do whatever you feel like. You're a good person. Frank. Mm. Cool, cool. Thank you. Thank you. Diddly Dee. Miss me? Don't answer that. All right. Catch you guys later. You're a bad sponsor. Why? I supported every decision he wanted to make. Stop wasting time! Ow! God! Let's go find Liam. Shit! Don't hit me. Things have already taken a bit of a dark turn, it would seem. Yeah. Okay, I need to get to Maureen before Frank and Dee. All right? Oh, we'll come with you. No, just hang back. I got this, okay? Dude, are you thinking what I'm thinking? Yeah. We could definitely get laid here. Huh? What? Maureen, I need to speak with you. Dennis! OMG, what are you doing here? Well, uh, I have reason to believe that someone is here to destroy this special day for you, so I'm sure to make sure that doesn't happen. That is so sweet, Dennis. I also brought along some legal documents, so if we could just wrap this up lickety-split. Legal documents? What? Yeah, I realize my timing is a little unorthodox, but, uh, I figure what better way to make sure your union is totally complete than by having you sign these documents that I need you to sign? So if I can just get your signature right here, and I'll run up and get Liam's signature, and this'll be on the books and your wedding Muh! My Maureen, you've you've enhanced yourself. Yeah, I got my tooth fixed. I'm talking about your tits! You big, giant new titties, Maureen! Why would you do that now? Why not when we were together when I could've? I told you I was willing to change. Yeah, but I didn't know you meant physically, that you would change physically. Why weren't you more clear with me, Maureen? All right, you know what? I'm not gonna get distracted. Just, just sign right here Wait! What are you doing in here?! You can't see the bride before the ceremony! No, no! Get out! I just need her to sign this! No! Get out of here! Wait, wait, wait! Maureen! No matter what happens, you got to go through with this! Out! Liam is your destiny, Maureen! Oh, here he comes. I didn't get it. I mean, I'm so close, I'm so close. Do you know where Liam is? Maybe I can get his signature first. I didn't see him anywhere. I'm sorry, but I got to bring this up. Things are getting really weird. I mean, check out Pappy McPoyle. What is that all about? I'll tell you what that's all about. Zombies. Zombies? I seen it once before in a rat, and I seen it now in men. Once one gets a taste for its own kind, it can spread through the pack like a wildfire. Mindlessly chomping and biting at their own hinds. Nothing but the taste of flesh on their minds. You know the thing about a rat? It's got life in its eyes. Black eyes like a doll's eye. Don't seem to be living at all when it come at ya. Till it bites ya. And then the eyes roll over white. You don't hear nothing but the screaming and the hollering. What are you doing?! Are you doing the speech from Jaws?
 Nah
 Are you doing Jaws? We don't have time for this shit. This is serious. Look, it wasn't zombies, okay? Really? Yeah. Then you explain what happened next. Okay, it's time to get out of here. I mean, look at that guy. The McPoyles sprung from my loins, fully formed! One of them babies tried to eat me! I ate him first! I ate him first! Okay, I'm with Charlie. I'm leaving. Wait. You guys are just gonna leave? You're gonna, you're gonna go? Yeah, we're out. You know what? I don't give a shit. Yeah, go, go, go. Yeah, get the hell out of here! I didn't want you here in the first place! Yeah, I understand the McPoyle bloodline's very strong. Legions of us thousand sturdy ones ruled this fine land. Our bloodline was as pure as the driven snow. Mm-hmm. And then what happened? Syphilis killed about half of us. Mm. Mongoloidism got most of the rest. Right. Yep. Well, there's somebody inside who wants to talk to you about this. Mm? Who's this guy? Ryan! We need to talk! We'll leave you guys alone. Let them hash it out themselves. It'll bust up. What the hell is that? Holy shit. I'm gonna go. No, no, no, Deandra! What?
 No, you gotta stay!
 I don't have to stay. You gotta finish this. Uh, I'm not going to. But we're not done! Don't, don't go out there! Deandra! And we never saw Dee again. Oh, no. No. We saw Dee. Yeah. Yeah, that's when the shit started hitting the fan. Oh, look, there's Dee! Dee! Dee! Don't go down there! Do not go down there! We just got attacked by a bunch of zombies! Yeah, and the shuttle bus is gone! A zombie must have stolen your car! Your car is gone! There's no way out of here! There's no way out! What are you doing? She's infected! She's infected! Liam? Liam?! Liam! Hello, Liam? Frank? Hi, Dennis. What did you do with Liam? You're too late. He's getting talked out of it! Ha-ha-ha! Get out of my way. No! Get out of my way, Frank! Hey, man. What are you guys doing? I'm begging Liam for forgiveness! It's time we move on. Liam convinced me it's not our blood that's being tainted. It's us tainting the blood of others. McPoyles will take over the world! Goddamn it! It backfired! Wonderful. And first step towards that is signing this. So Liam, if you'd just sign right there, please. Just sign right there. Go ahead. You got it. Stupid asses. One down, one to go. Nice try, Frank. What the hell is going on? Get the hell out of the way. Get out of the way! Jesus Christ! We gotta get out of here. I'm not going anywhere, Frank. I'm not going anywhere till I get that signature. Go, go, go! Hey, dude, check it out. Remember when Dee, you know, she sucked that bat poison or whatever out of Frank's head from the vampire bat? Yeah. That must be what turned her into a zombie. Why would a vampire bat turn you into a zombie? You're mixing up your horror genres. If anything, it would turn you into a vampire. Right or a bat, or a bat. Or Batman. No, a vampire turns you into a vampire. A zombie turns you into a zombie and Batman didn't get turned into anything. He just likes bats. That can't possibly be what Batman's about. It's about a grown man who dresses up like a bat? And goes around solving crimes and mysteries, yes. These are Academy Award winning movies. This is serious stuff. Well, you know the Academy, Charlie, I mean I know the Academy as well as anybody. Sometimes, it's atrocious. Well, to bring it all back around, I think when Dee drank the bat blood, that's how she got sick. Frank's blood. Yes, but the bat juices. You know, the bat saliva, bat rabies. No, no, it's not Bat rabies, I buy. Bat rabies. Yeah. Like the Dude, we got to get out of here. Yeah, go. Things had gotten completely insane. Dennis was trying to get the signature from Maureen, but we were just trying to get the hell out of there. Oh, my God. What the hell? Frank, what the hell's going on? Dude, we got to get out of here. Where's Dennis? I lost him. You guys, I couldn't get it. I couldn't get it. She wouldn't sign it. I couldn't get the stupid bitch to sign. She didn't sign? This has all gone bad. It's gone terribly, terribly bad. What did you do? I did something bad. I did something really, really bad; guys, we got to get out of here before everybody finds out what happened. Guys, I messed up. I messed up bad. All right, guys, let's just make a break for it. Which way? One, two, three, go. Come on, come on, this way, this way, this way. My face! My face! My face! One, two, three. Oh, God! Frank! Over here, over here. And then that's where you picked us up, and honestly, that's all that we know. Yes. So you're telling me that this was a wedding full of zombies? Yeah. Well, bat rabies zombies. Whatever. There was weird incestuous jealousies, we don't know what was going on. Bottom line, you got the wrong guys. We're innocent. Yes, we're totally innocent. Marconi, we just picked somebody up from the site who's claiming to know what happened. She was locked in a freezer. Don't let her in here. No, she's been infected. I'm not infected, you stupid idiots. No one was infected. Here's what happened. Let them hash it out themselves. It'll bust up. Yeah. I'm gonna go. Deandra. Dee's nuts. What's the haps? Here, have a sip, right from the cow's titty. You'll love it. No, Bill, no. I got to get out of here, okay? Shit is going crazy. No, don't go. Party's just starting. You got to have some. Come on, try it. Come on, it'll loosen you up a bit, make your butthole hot. How is drinking a glass of milk going to loosen me up, Bill? Well, I spiked the milk with methylenedioxypyrovalerone. What? It's bath salts. Yeah, yeah, it's like coke and acid and meth all combined. It's awesome. Yeah, I get it. So everyone here is on bath salts? Yeah, pretty much. Oh, my God, just move. Bath salts? The drug that makes people eat each other's faces? Wait, that would explain the zombie behavior. Right, okay, Dee, so you were on bath salts and that's why you went all nuts on us. Now it makes sense. That is not why I went nuts on you guys. Huh? I went nuts on you because of what you assholes did to my goddamn car! Dude, when was the last time you drove a car? Don't worry about it, man. I can drive; I remember how. What? No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, wait. No! What happened, dude? What happened? I forgot how to drive. I forgot how to drive. Oh, God. Oh, look, Charlie, there's Dee. Dee, don't go down that way. We just got attacked by a bunch of zombie people. The shuttle's gone. Zombies must have stolen your car. There's no way out of here. Dude You sons of bitches! You're gonna pay! You're all gonna pay! I'll kill you! You assholes, you'll pay! No, we won't pay. We never do. Okay, well, there it is. You know, there's the whole story. Ponderosa spiked the punch. Somebody hopped up on bath salts but Liam's face, and, uh, case closed, you know? Hey, good for you. Good for us. Bye. Ba-da-bing. Hey, whoa. Sit down, slick. Now that may explain some of the shit that went on here, but it doesn't answer the question of the missing bride. Since you're the one with motive and the last one to be seen with her, you're my new #1 suspect. No, no. That's I didn't murder her. Then tell me what happened to her! I-I don't know. I don't know. Listen, if you confess, I can help you, but you got to tell me what happened. Okay, all right, all right, all right. Okay. Look, if I tell you what I did, will you just help me, please? Because I need help. I'll see what I can do with the DA, but I need you to confess. Okay, fine. Fine. I-I was just going to see her to get the final signature so I could put this whole thing behind me. When I saw her Something bad happened. Something very bad. Oh, shit. Oh, God, Maureen. That was terrible. Who did those tits? The nipple placement is crazy.
 I love you, Dennis Reynolds.
 No, you don't. I love you. No, look, you're just gonna sign these papers and we're gonna be done with this, okay? Never. Let's run away together. Oh, I'm gonna run away, but not with you. I'm gonna find you. Oh, no, no, you're not gonna find me, no, no. We can't do this, Maureen. Oh, no, please. What have I done? Oh, God, what have I done? Oh, God. Oh, God! So all that shit about us ruining the wedding And the zombies and the bath salts and the blood It turns out you blew it yourself. Yeah, congratulations, Frank. You win. I'm gonna be paying alimony to that crazy bitch for the rest of my life. You expect me to believe this woman's gonna throw her entire life away just to sleep with her ex-husband on her wedding night? Huh? Really? Mr. Reynolds, you're free to go. What? Why am I free? No. Yes. No. Someone posted your bail. Come on, silly head. Let's go home and put this whole adventure behind us. No. No! No! No, you got to help me. What have I done? You got to help me! What have I done? No! No! No!                        I just I can't believe you just bought, like, another ridiculous ugly car. You are lucky I am letting you into my goddamn Oh, shit, okay, okay, here she comes, here she comes. Okay, see, what is she doing? She appears to be delivering food. No. That's not what I'm saying-- I know that. She's actually delivering Indian food now-- it's a good gig. But I mean, why is she not locking up her bike? This is a bad neighborhood. Oh, shit. Okay, look at this guy. He's totally gonna steal it. I got to move. What are you talking about? Keep it moving, guy! Goddamn it! Charlie! What are you doing here? You're just leaving your bike unlocked? I'm protecting it so it doesn't get stolen! Okay, you know what? I'm done. I am so done with this. You need to stop stalking me. You need to leave me alone. Look do you have any idea what a mess your life would be if I wasn't always helping you out? I keep a list. I keep a list of things that I do, okay? I watch your bike so it doesn't get stolen, okay? I put, uh I put vitamins in your shampoo so your hair doesn't fall out. I test your food so it doesn't get poisoned. Charlie! Listen to me. I am finished. Stop following me. Do you want me to be happy? Do you want me to be happy? Yes! Then stop being around every time I turn around! You have to leave me alone! You want me to be, like, gone forever? Yes. Do you hear me? Yeah, I hear you. It's Okay. Okay, so this is good-bye? Yeah. Good-bye, I guess. Great. Okay, good. Thank you. Bye. Goddamn. Charlie. Oh, shit, she slammed you, huh? Do you want to follow her around some more? Nah, whatever, she's, like she's right, you know? Can we just go back to the bar, Dee? Mm, no, I'd like to follow her around. Uh goddamn it! If you don't have car insurance, you better have dental because I am gonna smash your teeth into dust! So sorry, that was completely my fault. Yeah, it's goddamn your fault, I Oh look at you. My God. I'm Trevor. This is my sister Ruby. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Oh, geez. No. I don't understand. None of this is making any sense. Dude what is not to understand, okay? We got in an accident, right? They felt a little bad about it, one thing led to another, they asked us out to, like, a dinner date. Who are these people exactly?
 Trevor and Ruby Taft. Right?
 Yeah. What do you mean "Taft"? Like the Taft family? I don't know. Yeah, Taft family, yes. That's a good get, Charlie. I'm rich, but these people are in the stratosphere. Yeah, my whole family was a Taft family. My uncles and grandfathers and cousins all worked for TaftCo Enterprises. My uncle even drowned in a vat of their molten steel. He didn't drown, he burned up. Yeah, he probably burned. Yeah, I don't think he drowned. Either way, this is a great opportunity, okay? Do not screw this up, because if you get into a family like this, it's like becoming royalty. What's the plan for the date? The I mean, no plans. We were just gonna be ourselves. Ha! Don't. Do not be yourself. No, no, no, that's terrible. Be anybody but yourselves. Anybody! Charlie, do not eat any cheese or any cheese-like substances, okay? If you see any cheese, you run away from it! Dee, do not be a drunk, punchy whore, okay, you whore? But No, there's no buts! There's no buts. Do not screw this up for me-- for you for all of us. What is the plan for the date? I guess we'll become one of them or something. Now, uh, as I understand it, your family came over on the Mayflower? Um, yes, they can actually be traced back to the original settlement. Oh, yeah. Well, I imagine they destroyed many an Indian. Mm. I too sort of have distaste for the Indians, you know? They're savage things. They're nasty, really. Right, right, they needed to be exterminated. I mean, you hate to say it, but You do hate to, but it's the truth. So congratulations to your family. Uh, my family, uh, we were we were a railroad family. That's right, the Vandervelts were a distant relative. Right, yeah. Well, and I, too, am of a large um, money-ful family. He, too. Shippers of-of goods and, uh Services. Builders of tall Buildings. Would anyone like a drink? A drink? No, thank you. No, thank you, never will I drink. Whoop! Mm It's all right. That's all right. Is he all right? Just talk about a different I can ignore the cheese. It's not I'm sorry, I can't do it! All right, then screw it. 'Cause I've been eying this guy all night long. Excuse me, oh! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. We've been putting on airs. I know I come across, like, super fancy. I'm not. We're not the blue blood fancy types that you think that we are. Thank God! We thought we made a huge mistake. We like you guys 'cause you aren't anything like the people that we know. Really? Yes. Oh, my God. Oh, shit, that is such a relief because look at this pit stain. I mean, we're, like, totally, like, normal. Oh, I'm sweating like You like this pit stain? That's nasty, yo! I've got bodily functions, I'm sorry! Hey, guys, can we do some shots? Yes! I would love to do some shots. Right, see, we're getting after it now! We're getting after it! No, no, see, this doesn't add up. This does not make any sense. Why is this going well? Can the girl not smell Charlie? Can the guy not see Dee? Something's fishy. Dennis, don't poke holes in this, okay? This is like Lady Di being plucked from the streets like the trash she was and the trash that Charlie and Dee are. No, wait, wait, wait, wait. I know what's going on here, guys. Now this makes sense. See, I know what's happening here. This is a Les Liaisons Dangereuses. Oh, shit! A what? Dangerous Liaisons. What is that? The movie. I don't know that movie. It was like-like Cruel Intentions. She's All That? Can't Buy Me Love? Almost any movie made in the late '90s? Guys, guys, these are the games that rich people with nothing but time on their hands play with people that they perceive to be below them. That girl is just toying with Charlie. She's gonna crush him. Yeah, I hate to say it, but I think you're right. What about Dee? What, Dee? No, she's constantly being crushed. She'll bounce back, she always does. Or she won't. It doesn't matter. I don't care about that. All I care about is Charlie here. Now, guys, we got to dig a little deeper. Oh! Ooh! Ooh! Oh, look at this. Look at this. Shall we? You're going. Oh, no, no, no. No, you guys are going, right? No. Get in the car and leave. No, we' c Ping with. Don't glom onto this. Hi, you guys. Hey, you brought some friends. No. No. No, not friends. Hobos. Yeah. Come on in. The more, the merrier. You guys up for some tennis? Yeah! Yeah. You got booze? You got food? You got stuff to eat? All right. All right, Frank, I'll play on Ruby's team, and over the course of the game, I'll subtly extract her plan to humiliate Charlie. I'll get her. Oh, yes, I will definitely have her. Whoa, whoa, Dennis, you're not gonna hit on her, right? Huh? No, no. Look, you sounded like you were gonna try to bang her. I'm not gonna hit on her, okay? I'm not gonna try and bang her.
 Don't. Don't do it.
 Just, will you trust me? Whoa! Come on! Come on, Frank! Oh, hey, stay on that side when the ball comes to you. No. Ball! Damn it! Hey, yo, Ruby. Time out, time out. Let's take a little break. Yeah? Let's take a little breather. I thought you said you were good at this. I am good. It's just, you know, this shirt is, like, ridiculously-tight, and it's restricting my play, so, I think I'm just gonna pop it off. Oh. What do you think about this? About what? What I'm presenting you. I think you look really pale. Do you need some sunscreen? Well, it's the first of the season. I haven't had a chance to get a base going, you know? Dennis? Dennis? What do you think of the pecs? What do you think of?
 Dennis?!
 What? Come here! Give me a second, all right? What? I thought you said you weren't gonna hit on her. Am I hitting on her? Yeah. Oh, shit. Okay. No, you're right. Okay, I went into default mode. My bad. Yeah, all right. Hey, do I look pale?  Company, always on the run Destiny is the rising sun  What the hell is she doing?! She's gonna ruin this whole thing!  That's why they call me  Bad company Zee, zah, da, da   And I can't deny  I love how free and uninhibited you are. Oh, yeah? How about I free that big fat snake in your pants and uninhibit myself all over it? What? Let's hump. Oh. Whoops. Hey, guys. Whoa! Whoa! Shit. No. No. Oh, sorry. He You startled me. That's a pretty good stance you got there. Are you trained? I spent some training, yeah. You? Yeah. Krav Maga. That's cool. Judo, karate. I got more of a Catholic thing going on. You know, sort of the hand of God. Stupid idiot. Get out here! Beat it. We were in the middle of a thing. No, no. That was really cool. Could you show me that last move again? Get out of here! Go on! Get of here! We're in the middle of some the middle of something. Whoa, whoa, whoa, no, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, whoa. Ow. Sorry you got a cramp. Oh, she's really digging her hooks into him, mm-hmm. What a bitch. Ugh! Hold on a second. Oh, the same person keeps calling me. I'm just gonna answer it. Hello. Who is this? Who? Who is? I don't know that name. Who? Who? Oh, oh, Waitress. Why didn't you just say that? Uh, because my name is not Waitress. Okay, you know what? It doesn't even matter. Did Charlie steal my bike? What are you talking about? Charlie's been with me the entire day. How did you get this number? I changed it. Look, I need my bike back, because if I don't get it back, I'm gonna lose my job. Look, I don't Ha, ha, ha, ha, ugh! Hello? Hello? God! I'm gonna have to change my number again Holy shit. Oh, no. Frank, I just realized something. What? Without Charlie doing all those insane things he's always doing for the waitress, her life is gonna completely change. What do you mean? Well, so, she's gonna be constantly calling or dropping by, looking for answers, so there's a very good chance that she's gonna have a front-row seat for the final moment of humiliation. And that's gonna destroy Charlie for good. What's the final moment of humiliation? That's the climactic moment where the rich people reveal their twisted game to all their wealthy friends, and everybody has a good laugh. Okay, Frank, here's what's gonna have to happen. You're gonna have to do all of those creepy things on Charlie's list to keep the waitress from poking around while this whole thing runs its course. What are you gonna do? Phew! I got something very important planned. Come in! There's a problem! I can't make head or tail of Charlie's chicken scratch! Just do the best you can, okay? I can't can't really talk right now. Putting rat poison in her shampoo. Just gonna make her hair fall out. Crazy. I don't know. Look, the kid knows her better than anybody else. If he puts rat poison in her hair, put rat poison in her hair. Look, I'm busy. I can't talk. What do you mean, you're busy?! This is the whole thing, Dennis! I'm just I'm getting some stuff done, okay? Oh, shit! I think she just came in. I'm getting another call. Hold on, hold on. Hello? Who? Who?! Just say Waitress! Look, has Charlie been poisoning me? 'Cause I've been Frank, you got to step it up with that list, man. This bitch is driving me nuts. What happened? Just, I'm busy, okay? Just do it. Hello?! Hello?! Hello? Charlie? No. It's your neighbor. Can I be, like, perfectly honest with you about something? Yeah. There's a there's a girl who lives in this building, and, um, well, she's she's the love of my life. Okay. And, uh and I like you so much that before we move any further, I just I don't know. I had to get that out there, 'cause I think I'm ready to let her go, but I just have to be sure. Does that make sense? Yeah. Charlie? There you are. Look, I don't know what kind of twisted game you're playing, but you need to make it stop. Whoa. Hold on a second. I have no idea what you're talking about. Really? Because someone's been poisoning me, and something is making my hair just fall out. Look, calm down, all right? I-I I've been with her the last couple days. I really haven't been anywhere near you. Yeah, he's been with me. Oh, shut up, bitch! Who the hell is this, Charlie?! Hey! No. She She's my girlfriend. Oh, my God. Sorry about that. Come on. Let's get out of here. I'm sorry about that. Wow. How's this, Trevor? Is this cool? Very cool. Get off me! Shut up, Dee! I got that stupid bitch. Oh! Goddamn it! Goddamn it! Oh! Clocked him. Oh! Oh Oh, no Amazing! You guys are out of control. I'm out of control. I'm out of control. Yeah, you are. Hey, I want to invite you two to a party at our estate tomorrow night. My father's going public with TaftCo. Oh, well, then are you sure you want him to come? Of course. He's practically family. Hey! Come on, show me some more of those moves. Oh, yeah. Okay, well, this next stuff I learned from a wrestler called The Maniac. So we're gonna have to go ahead and get pretty oiled up. Sure. Great. This is classy as shit, huh? Dee, crack that open for me, 'cause it's hurting my hands. Yeah. I wonder why he didn't tell us it was black-tie. I feel like we're underdressed. Because, Dee, Trevor loves us for us. Hey. Oh, hey! Glad you guys could make it. Thanks, man! How you doing? These are a few of my old frat brothers. This is Dee and Mac that I was telling you about. Hi. What's up, boys? How are you? Hey, um, I'm sorry that we're not dressed appropriately. I mean, you guys all look so good. Oh, well, the attire at these sorts of events are well, things my friends and I take for granted. Don't be embarrassed, though. You guys didn't know any better. No, I should've known better, 'cause I'm practically a Taft myself. My uncle's probably built into the foundation of this place. Really? Weird. Hey, where do you want us to sit? Well, you guys'll be out here with some of my frat brothers' guests. Now, if you'll excuse us, we all have some catching up to do. Oh, yeah. We'll we'll meet you af we'll see you after. Kind of weird, right? Yeah, but at least we can make fun of these dorks all night long, right? That'll be fun. Geeks! Oh, no, Mac. I see what's going on here. He's doing to us what I like to do to Charlie and the waitress. Huh? Oh, no. Follow me. Oh! I got that stupid bitch. Oh! Goddamn it! Oh! Man, biggest losers ever. You know it. Oh! Oh! That's two for one, fellas. Come on, pay up, pay up. Those two are by far the worst we've ever had. Let's go. Goddamn it. I can't believe it. That's a tough pill to swallow. What are you doing here? You know, they're not the only ones who know how to play these games. Huh? What? I'm saying I also know I have a thing. Just come with me. Come with me. All right, folks, if you could settle down, please? If I could have your attention. Uh, thank you all for being here tonight. I, uh, I wanted you all here so that I could tell you this. I've decided to go public with TaftCo Enterprises. Wonderful! Oh, bravo! Excuse me. Fantastic, Neil! Good for you! Good for you! Too bad when you do, the SEC's gonna be all up in your ass. What? You see, you thought you all could get together and play your little games, have some fun, you know, invite some geeks to the ball, swap some stories, have a laugh. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! But you took it a little too far when you gave an inside-trading tip to my friend Mac, didn't you, Trevor? What are you talking about? Pedro. And by the way, my father's going public with TaftCo next week, so buy stock today at 34, not 36. Cool. Yeah, I'll call my broker. Right, call your broker. Ooh you ready for round two, big guy? This-this is taken out of context. What was the context? Wrestling. It's wrestling. We're oiled up and wrestling. What is so hard to understand about this?! Nice, huh? Trevor you imbecile! Why would you tell him that? I didn't know I was being filmed. If you're in my room, you're always being filmed. It's true. It's his thing, it's kind of creepy, but But that's not all, everyone. You see, Ruby Taft, she likes to play her little games, too, don't you Ruby? But I am not gonna let you humiliate my other friend either. Cause he might be choosing someone else after all. Charlie, phone call for you. Charlie, somebody accidentally hit the waitress with my car-- their car, when they were following her. No she wants to talk to you. She says she really needs you. Wait, did she say that, or are you just saying it? Yeah, talk to her yourself. Charlie, look, I don't know what's been going on, but if you think you can make it stop, I need your help. I want you back in my life. Do you really mean that? Yeah. I need you. Okay. I'll be right there. Awesome. Well, I'm out of here. What? What are you talking about. I'm leaving. I'm going to be with the waitress-- she's the woman I love. No, but I I wasn't using you like Charlie was. He's a total asshole. I really, really, really like you. Oh. Yeah, I know. Okay? I was using you. That's why I kissed you in front of the waitress. That's why I banged you a bunch of times, just to make the waitress jealous. Amazing. You slept with me almost instantly. And by the way, a quality woman doesn't do that. She doesn't say yes right away. She says no to a man, for years, like, ten years. That's what a real woman does, okay? You know what you were acting like? A stupid little rich slut. And that's all that you are. How can you do this to me? Are you still talking? Go away, dumb-dumb. Go run and hide. Go from me. I don't want to see you anymore. Women, right? Ah, man, all right, cool. I'm out! All right! I didn't see that coming. No. Guess Charlie had the cruelest intentions of all, huh? Uh, see? Feeling better? Yeah. You know, I-I've, um, I've been thinking about the restraining order. You're gonna get rid of it? No. No, no. But, um, but I was thinking about reducing it from, like, a hundred feet to, like 50 feet? Awesome! Okay. Okay. I can work with that. All right. Oh, so now? Starting now? Yeah, probably. Could you just leave the soup there? Uh is this okay over here, or? Uh, I don't think there's I'll go down the hall. Okay. I'll see you tomorrow. All right, well, that's fine. From a distance, though.                     Goddamn. And how is the psoriasis coming? Has it gotten any better? Oh! It's not good, Doc, it's not good. I'm scaling up like a goddamn boa constrictor over here. Skin conditions can be manifestations of deeper issues. Well, you're not a skin doctor, so let's drop it already, okay? I got beef with you. Excuse me? I am mad at you! Remember that cooperative dinner you had me have with my friends so we could try and resolve some of our issues? Well, it blew up in my face. What happened? Uh, screaming and tears and physical threats, uh, Frank pulled out his gun, somebody dropped the "N" bomb. I don't remember where that came from, but it was messy. No, I mean why did it all fall apart? Oh. No one was assigned the dishes. And that all happened over the dishes? Yes. And frankly, I haven't seen any results since I've been coming to you, so as far as I'm concerned, you're in the hot seat until you resolve this. Resolve this? Who's going to do the dishes! And also, this is a great opportunity for you to see how insane my asshole friends are. You brought them here? Of course I brought them here-- what, are you gonna come to my house? Hey, assholes, get in here. Did you guys sort it out? Did you sort it out already? How long were we gonna sit out there for? All right, listen, lady, I'll tell you one thing. I ain't doing these goddamn dishes! Therapy is stupid. I don't trust a shrink. They screw with your head. Frank, it's the only way to settle the argument and find out who is the winner. Okay, uh let me first just say that arguments do not have winners. Yeah, actually, this argument is more about determining who the loser will be, because most of us will be winners. Yeah, yeah, and it's not gonna be me, okay? I'm not doing those dishes, because I had the hardest job. Setting the table? Are you dumb? I hosted! It was wall-to-wall details! I was on edge the whole time. Well, it's gonna be you or Frank or Charlie, 'cause Dennis and I cooked. The food was mush. The food was divine. It was pheasant. I never did the dishes before and I'm not starting now. I bankrolled; case closed. Well, I had the hardest job of anyone-- I traveled all the way to this exotic merchant in search of this rare fowl What the hell are you talking about, Charlie? You went to the corner gourmet grocery store and you bought pheasant. Okay. This is all, you know, a little bit unorthodox, but it is clearly about much more than just the dishes. Yeah, there's always levels. Well, yeah, I mean, we're complex people, you know? Our rivers run deep, and I believe I can help you with this. Let me stop you right there, actually, Doc-- I can help you. You see, I have a background in academic psych myself, from an Ivy League college, no less, not this, uh, LaSalle. It sounds like a pasta dish. It does, it does. But let's not be mean, Frank. Some people don't have the same access that we do. Now, use me as a resource. Think of me as a colleague. Now, I was thinking we could start with a few one-on-ones, you know, move on to a couple of mix-'em-ups, you know, and then end with a big group dealio. I'm going first, please? Can I go first? Uh, Mac, I'll be the one to determine who goes first. And it is you. Aah! Yes! You seem very on edge. Yeah, you're goddamn right I'm on edge! I hosted the shit out of that party! And that's just not setting the table, okay? I made a playlist, I thought of cool shit to talk about, I provided security, I kept everybody safe! Safe! You know, sometimes I feel like I feel like they don't even understand me and we're not even that good of friends. That's bullshit! That's bullshit! We're, like, the best friends in the whole goddamn world! Goddamn them for making me think otherwise! Are you okay? Huh? Oh, yeah, yeah. I was just thinking of something that Charlie said that was really funny. Mac, let me ask you a question. Yeah. Do you often feel strong emotion felt in quick succession? Oh, yeah. And not just my emotions. I have had a slight fluctuation with my weight recently. I see. And how much weight are we talking about? I gained and lost 60 pounds in three months. Wow, that's almost impossible. Well, first of all, through God, all things are possible, so jot that down. And yeah, yeah, I had a difficult time there. I had to buy all new clothes, and people used to cross the street when I would walk by. They'd be, like, "Whoa, look at that monster coming towards us, you know, barreling towards us." Mac you're not that guy anymore. Don't you think I know that? And I'm starting to think that I'll never become that monster again. Oh, so you preferred being scary to people? Yeah. Lady, I was as big as a skyscraper, and now I'm as tiny as a postage stamp. Oh. I get it. Cute. You leave this pen here and people are supposed to think, "Wait, that looks like a dick." Mac, have you ever heard of the term "body dysmorphia"? Is that what I have? Is that what's making me so thin? No. Body dysmorphia is when you see a distorted version of yourself that no one perceives but you. Oh, but Dennis perceives it, too, because he's been giving me size pills to make me bigger. Dennis is, like, my best buddy. Well, oftentimes, drugs don't address the root of the problem. Talking through the issues may be the best way for you to address your mood swings and body issues. Talking about it? Talking about it! No, that's good. That's good. So if we talk about it, then you think that I'll get most bigger from talking! Oh, that's really good. You know thank you. Thank you for this. You know, when I first walked in here, I was, like, "There's no way that this is gonna work," 'cause I just do not get the whole woman doctor thing, but then when you started talking about God, I realized that you're one of the smart ones. All right, let's do it, let's talk about it. Let's talk about God, and let's talk about how you're gonna make me more bigger. Will you put the pen down? Hey-o! Time's up! Get out, slim. Let's go. That door is supposed to be locked. Oh, yeah, yeah, I taped the knob-- I knew I'd be popping in and out quite a bit. Let's go. Ticktock, ticktock. Time's up. Ticktock, tiny man. Okay, let's not get bogged down. You know, just time for headlines. Okay. These guys need structure, Doc, and that'll become clear to you-- you just don't see it yet. Now, you are gonna want to strap in for this next one. Charlie? Um why don't you share with me how you feel the dinner went. Fine, I'll do the dishes! You're just gonna make me do 'em anyway! No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Why do you assume I'm gonna make you do the dishes? 'Cause it's Charlie work, and I'm gonna get stuck with it, so I'll just do the dishes! Goddamn it! "Charlie work." What's "Charlie work"? Fill me in. Oh, right. You don't even know what Cha? Right. Okay, well, Charlie work is, like, you know, like, basement stuff, cleaning urinals, uh, blood stuff, your basic slimes, your sludges. Anything dead, or decay, you know, I'm on it, I'm dealing with it. And you dislike it? Well, no. I mean, at its core, I love it. You know, I love the dark, I love slippery things, I love being naked, uh, in the sewer. Bleach smells good, uh, tastes good, you know, but it's just, like, I don't like being told what to I'm sorry, I didn't get that last one. I don't like being told what to do. Everyone's always telling me what to do all the time. Got it, got it. Kick me around. I'm, like, probably the weirdest guy in the universe, you know. Probably even weirder than someone from Saturn. Why do you think you're weird? I don't know. I'm just weird, I guess. What did what did Dee tell you? I'm not at liberty to discuss other patients I mean, like, would it be weird if you survived an abortion? You know, would it be weird if, like, you shared a bed with a man who may or may not be your father? Again, I can't talk about You know what would be weird? If you eat cat food to go to sleep, and you have such a fascination with cats that maybe you glue cat hair on the back of your neck every now and then? That's new information that I haven't You know, I mean, 'cause, so, you know, like, is it bad? No. No. Being comfortable in your own skin is never a bad thing. Oh, my God, right. Okay, so if I got, like, more skin or something, then I could, like, never do a bad thing in my life, and maybe I never have done a bad thing 'cause I have a lot of skin. That's not what I'm saying. What I'm saying is, given your nontraditional life choices, you are surprisingly well-adjusted. Uh-huh. Yeah, I'm well-adjusted, you know, because of my lack of traditions, and I'll adjust to that, and I feel like you're mirroring my words, but you're not exactly understanding them. You're saying, like, do the things you do, go even further with them. You know, maybe get a ton of cat hair, glue it all over your body, you know, walk around like a cat man in the night through the alleyways. You know, and stop hiding the pigeon. The pigeon? This one. You know, let him be who he wants, let him let him fly away. Go! He's dead, I think. So, you've had the a dead pigeon in your jacket this whole time? He was alive at one point, you know. I'm not crazy. It's just, I think I might have hugged him a little too hard, kind of smothered him a bit, but, um, hey, we'll make an adjustment, uh, to it, and we'll make a tradition out of it. Okay Let's talk about I ain't talking about nothing! This skull is Fort Knox. Why don't you trust therapists? I opened up to a therapist just once. I was a kid. I got into a fight. The doctor asked me question after question! Got me so scrambled up. Next thing you know, I was shanghaied upstate to a nitwit school. You know what a nitwit school is? I assume you mean a school for the mentally disabled. Yeah. Not just for nuts in the head. Bodies, too. Back then, science was real crude. They stuck us all together. My roommate was a frog kid. You ever see a frog kid? Frog kid? Yeah. The place was windowless. There was a guard every ten feet. All the rooms had drains in the floors so they could hose us down. How terrible! Got my first kiss there. Frank? It was terrible! But not her. She was an angel. Always smiling. That's because she had no lips, but her mouth was still very much in play. Let's talk about the dishes. Oh! She died two weeks later. She thought she was a space man with a plastic bag for a helmet. Oh! Aah! Oh, you unzipped me. It's all coming back. It's all coming back. I hate you! It's all coming back, you understand?! I don't like it! I don't like to think about it. Oh, it's-it's With a plastic bag for a helmet! Oh! Oh! Oh, you unzipped me. Oh! Oh! This is me saluting you. I'm a big fan of your work. How quickly you rattled their cages, broke them all down. It's not about breaking. It's about helping them. Hmm. It's interesting, our thing, isn't it? To be in someone's mind, to have complete control. It's like the thrill of being near the executioner's switch, knowing that at any moment, you could throw it, but knowing you never will. But you could. Never isn't the right word, because I could, and I might. I probably will. Will you sit down, please? Yeah, sure. Sorry. Did I make you nervous? Not my intention. Well So who would you like to discuss first? How about you? That's good, but we don't really have time for jokes, so let's jump right into it, shall we? Now, I've long maintained psychological dossiers on every single one of those raving lunatics in your waiting room right now. The top one, and the thickest, by far, is Charlie's, of course. But I'd rather start with Mac. Oh. Start with a simple one. Now, how did your session with him go? Dennis, as I think you know, I'm not at liberty to discuss another patient. Listen, why don't you think of me more as a peer, you know, in the academic sense, of course? In terms of age, you're decades older than me. But why don't I start, okay? Um, if you'll open up your dossier there, you'll see there on the first page is something that you picked up on almost immediately, which is his reverse body dysmorphia. And this a well-placed pen, can have quite an effect on a man like him. This must have given him quite the thrill. I bet he tried to suck on this. Did he? Huh? It's okay, Doc. You can tell me. He's always sucking on the pens in our apartment. I'm always having to hide them. Well, I showed you mine. Why are some of these pages written in crayon? My file on Dee was started in the second grade. Interesting. Interesting? Tell me about these size pills you're giving Mac. Well, now, that's more like it. So they're Mexican ephedra. Calling them size pills was an eloquent solution. The guy was gross. It was disgusting. He was fat as shit, he smelled liked shit, he sounded like shit, his groans, his snores, the sleep apnea. It was gross. He was repulsive, really. So he has no appetite because you're drugging him, secretly. Giving a man medicine for his disease-- wherever did I get that idea? What are you writing? Writing? Oh, nothing. Drawing. Drawing conclusions. And drawing this. You like it? It's very generous. Dee, I'm afraid I have a serious issue to discuss with you. Yeah. I cannot help you if you are lying in every session. Lying? Why would I be lying? What are you talking about? Why would you where are you getting this? Were you or were you not Uh-huh. the first choice for the female lead in The Notebook? Yes. Yes, I was and I had to, unfortunately, pass because of a scheduling conflict. We We went over this. I graciously handed it to Rachel McAdams and she did a fine job with the film. I'm secure enough to admit that. I'm finding all this hard to believe. Oh, what do you want to hear, Doc, huh? That I had cigarettes put out on me when I was a kid? That this isn't a surgery scar, huh? That my father stabbed me? Huh? Okay, let me interrupt you for a second, okay, because I think we have an example happening right before our eyes. You're speaking right now with a Brooklyn accent and yet Boston. It was a Boston accent. The accent was clearly from Brooklyn. This isn't a surgery scar. No, you don't say scar. That's clearly Brook Yes, I did. No. Okay, the point is, Dee >> It's a really good Hmm? I just met your father and I think that little bit was from Good Will Hunting. Yeah, he's not my father. That's a whole can of worms. I don't want to go into it. But it was from Good Will Hunting. How-how did you enjoy it? I'd rather discuss the father issue. You know what, she really wasn't that great, now that I think about it. Who? Rachel McAdams. Feel like I could've done a better job. Do you think that I would've done a better job, with that Ryan Gosling? I've never seen you act. Oh, really? Uh ta-da! I've been lying the whole time! Oh! So, good, you admitted it. Uh-uh, that was acting. What I just right there was acting. I said I was lying, and that wasn't even true. That was acting. All right, so uh! You are I am so I'm good. I am so How are you feeling about all of what I'm doing? Did you like that? Did you think that was good? Tell me I'm good. Tell me it was good. Tell me I'm good. Tell me I'm good. Tell me that was good. Tell me I'm good. Tell me I'm good. Tell me I'm good Tell me I'm good. Tell me I'm good. Tell me I'm good Tell me I'm good. Tell me I'm good. You're good. Thank you. Was it that hard? What is happening? Let it out. Let it out, Frank. Dennis, there was another twin in your mother's womb. We were going to call him Donnie. You and Deandra devoured him before he could be born. You gobbled him up. That can't possibly be true. Donnie! You would've been the good one. It would've been Bruce's kid anyway, Frank. Jesus Christ. I can't take much more of this shit. It's starting to irritate me. Dennis, Dennis, you should do some quadra-lift thrusters with me. Oh, better yet, get up on my shoulders. That's even better because then I need more weight on my back. Mac, if you want to get big, take a size pill. Take a size pill. No, thank you. What do you mean, "No, thank you"? Good for you. Yeah, I want to do this the right way, Dennis. The therapist implied that God wanted me to have bovine hormones and I think she's going to get them for me. Dennis, can I give you some advice? Absolutely not. Look, hey, do what you want to do in life, you know, and there's nothing wrong with that. Oh, what I want to do? Mmm, well that's what I want to do. Oh, well, I applaud you for that. Absolutely, you know. Oh, good. And now know that, of course, I'll come back at you with everything that I have. What are you? Get him, Charlie. Go ahead, get him. Get him, get him, get him, get him. Get him for Donnie. Get him. How's that? Huh? You having a white Christmas? You having a white Christmas, you bitch? This ends now, lady. This ends now. You got Frank all messed up, you got Mac not taking his size pills, you got Charlie thinking that he's well-adjusted when he's the craziest of all. Stop calling me crazy! I'm not crazy. You're crazy, okay? You've been eating pigeon all day and loving it. You all ate pigeon. What? What? Yeah, I served you pigeon, okay? I'm not going to spend my money on a pheasant when I can get a perfectly good street bird. All right, you ate pigeon Oh, my God! Jesus Christ, Charlie. Screw it. Tell him I'm not crazy. You are you know what, I don't care. I'm going to get my stomach pumped. Lady, you got to finish this, okay? Give us answers now. Well, I think we've made some great steps today. Dishes!
 What?
 Dishes.
 There is much more at play here than just
 Dishes! So you want me to just tell you who Dishes. Dishes. On a severe dysfunctional Dishes, dishes, dishes, dishes, dishes, dishes, dishes, dishes, dishes Okay, okay! Dee, do the  dishes. Boom!

Do I need help? No, sit tight, please, have a beer. I'll do the dishes. I got it, please, help yourself to the desert. It's in the refrigerator. You like this, huh? Here's the dishes.                      (knocking) CHARLIE: Hey, knock, knock. BONNIE: Oh, hi, Charlie. Hey, Ma. Listen, you're doing me a solid offering to do this laundry, all right? Well, we never get to talk. That's why I offered. We don't talk, and it's good that way. MAC: Hello. Hey, Mac's here. He brought his laundry. Thanks a bundle, Mrs. Kelly. I got Frank's stuff, Dee's stuff, Dennis' stuff, so you're gonna be working. Oh, okay, well, what I wanted to talk to you about Ooh, talky, talky, talky, talky, talky. You know, Mom, we're busy. We got a whole big day planned. Yeah, we got to go back to Paddy's and polish off a couple beers, so it's like Beers, you know, but hey. Time is of the essence. We'll come back when it's folded and good and done. I'd like to bring it up now. Um, I have cancer. Yeah, but I got to I'm sorry. What? I have lung cancer. What? But how? You don't even smoke. Well, you know, it's just one of those freak things. SWEET DEE: And then Psychic John said that he could tell I was under a tremendous amount of stress and that my heart was filled with sorrow. Now how would he have known that if he wasn't psychic? FRANK: I'm not giving you any money for your dumb psychic. But he says I'm gonna have a tremendous windfall of cash. You're losing your mind. You're being scammed. I'm losing my mind? How many pairs of shoes have you lost this month, Frank? Three. Hmm? Four. That's not the point. The point is my mind is as sharp as a what do you call it? Um, it's a Knife? No, uh, what you put What you What you I just don't understand why it's my fault. It's your fault because your mom is directly responsible. Yeah, but we both decided to move them in together, so you know, you deserve half the blame. You want to put half the blame on me? Guys, my mom has lung cancer. DENNIS: Oh, God. You know, geez. That's-that's terrible. What the hell was that, dude? That didn't sound very genuine. No. Sorry. What was I supposed to do? What are you Are you kidding me? Are you screwing with me right now? No, I'm sorry. I think the cancer thing, for whatever reason, is just not You know, it's just not grabbing me right now. Not grabbing you? My mom is dying! Okay, calm down, calm down. Okay, because my mom has a doctor that can cure the cancer for 4,200 bucks, so no big deal. That's it? No, I mean, that's a scam. That's what I was saying. Do you think it's a scam? Come on, people take advantage of old people and scam them all the time. Thumbtack. What? Thumbtack. We were talking about things that earlier that were sharp, and a thumbtack is sharp. Thumbtack? Yeah. All right. You see what I'm talking about? People get old and then their brains turn to mush, and then people come along and take advantage of them. Now, Frank, give me the hundred bucks you were excited to give me for my psychic. Oh, yeah. Sorry. Here you go. Thank you. Yeah. Where the hell are we? I mean, your mom's totally screwing my mom again with this doctor scam. No, it's not a scam, Charlie. She's been seeing this guy for years, and she doesn't have cancer. Yeah, I got to say, though, this is a strange place for a doctor's office. What's this guy's name? Dr. Jinx. Dr. Jinx is the name of a monkey, not a man. Come in. He lives in a garage? Yeah. Guys, look, let's just give him a shot, all right? If we don't like what we see, we reassess. All right. Go. (music playing) Oh, I'm sorry. Are you Dr. Jinx? Indeed I am. Have a seat. Goddamn it. So, what are we gonna do, guys? I'd just like to say this is, uh, this is weird. Now, I can understand your suspicions. Now, when most people think of a doctor, they don't think of a black man living in a garage surrounded by houseplants. I normally think Asian. Yeah, or I think of an Indian guy. Or white. Middle Eastern. Pretty much anything other than black. Is that racist? Hell, yeah, it's racist. Your parents ain't let you watch The Cosby Show when you was coming up? Oh, my parents would never have let me watch something like that. Let's not make this about racism. Let's make this about the man who's living in a garage treating my mom for cancer. Hey, hey, now, look, here's my deal: I use ancient homeopathic remedies derived from the Mother Earth. You can't get no cleaner than that. Homeopathic from Mother Earth, huh? Dr. Jinx, I have an eczema situation that's burning me up good. Do you have anything for that? Oh, shit. Well, that's not eczema. What you have there, my friend, that's sailor's rot. Sailor's rot? I'm not a sailor, Dr. Jinx. When was the last time you've been to Haiti? Never. I've never been to I've been to Kensington. When you was in Kensington, did you have intercourse with any hoes, ladies of the nights, or prostitutes? No. No. I have Don't worry about it. Doctor-client privilege. Don't worry about it. I got what you need, okay? Oh! Oh! Oh, that burns! (groans) Mother Earth don't play. Do you have anything from the Mother Earth that would be sprayed on me and cause me to have feelings again 'cause I'm having trouble feeling things. Oh, you want feelings? Oh, I have something for that. Dr. Jinx got something for feelings. (plays funky bass line) Okay, so that was a scam, right? Yep. Oh, absolutely, yeah. I think he sprayed me with Miracle-Gro. All right, guys, my mom has real problems. I need real help. Oh, I got it. I know exactly who we need to turn to next.  Raise you up on eagles' wings Bear you on the breath of dawn   Make you to shine like the sun and hold you in the palm of his hand.  Holy, holy, holy. Lord God of power and might, heaven and earth are full of your glory. This is ridiculous. What are we doing here? We're turning to the big man upstairs. He's gonna make this right. I can't believe you think this is a real solution to our problem. Dennis, what do you think of all this? Shh. Amen. I'm just trying to embrace this. I want to see if I can knock some emotion loose. This is ridiculous. Hey, hey, hey, don't say that; now kneel. Why do I have to kneel? I don't see the point. Because God wants it. Look, just do what the priest says; don't ask why, just do. Look, our moms are here. They see the value in it. Why can't you? (coughs) Where's your mom going? Oh, she keeps a cigarette burning out on the steps outside, so she's gonna go hack a butt. So, she just comes and goes as she pleases? There's no sort of rules for her? She's put her time in here, all right? The Lord makes an exception for her. Jesus Christ, man. Hey stop using his name in vain; now, stand. (groans) Stand? Yes, and give me some money for the baskets. No, I'm not giving you money. We have to give money Thank you, thank you. Look, maybe the church should give us money, you know? They seem to have plenty of it. Dude, the church doesn't give money; it takes it, all right? That's the way it works. And then you go to heaven. Now, kneel. Kneel? I got to kneel again? Actually, it's over. We're standing again. Son of a bitch! This is a scam, okay? This is a scam. It's kneeling, standing, getting people all confused. Hey, hey, come here. What are you doing? What are you doing? Offering you a sign of peace. I don't want this. Peace be with you. Can I say something? Can I say something? Sorry about your mother. (Charlie groans) Okay, I want to talk about someone in your life. Okay. Okay, someone close to you. All right. I'm getting a Fa No, I'm getting a Ba No, I'm getting a Da Dennis? Dennis! Is it? Yes, yeah, no, I'm seeing that. Dennis? Yup, yup, I'm seeing Dennis. Okay. And I am feeling as if he is a neighbor or an enemy. He's a coworker, friend, he's a relative He's my brother. He's your brother. Oh, my God. Yes. Is he how I'm getting my windfall of cash? You know, I'm not seeing clearly yet how you get the cash. I do see a lot of money in your future. You do? Yeah, but (laughing): Oh, shit. I think it's gonna take a few sessions to really get the whole picture. Is it? Ha-- I was just out buying new shoes and I remembered I didn't want to give you that hundred bucks. Yeah, and then you called me and you said you changed your mind and you'd like to give me another hundred, so where is it? I did? Yeah. Ah, shit. Hi. Psychic John. You have an interesting aura. Don't start with me. Who's gonna win the Super Bowl this year? You don't know shit. Well, I do know that you lost three pairs of shoes this month. You have a pork chop bone in your left pocket; you have 57 cents in your right, and you clipped someone's side mirror while parking in a handicap spot. Holy shit. That's good. Can you conjure the dead? Can you get my dead whore wife back here so I can lay into her from the other side? Well, I can't do that. Nah, because you're full of shit. I can't do it because I feel her spirit is still very much alive. (gong rings) What? No, well, I don't know about that. W-W-Wait a minute. I knew there was always something suspicious about that whore's death. Really? Yes, we didn't ask any questions. We never saw the body. We didn't go to the funeral. I am feeling as if she is still living somewhere in the city with a small Mexican dog. (Sweet Dee gasps) Does that ring a bell? Ooh, that dirty bitch. Well, I'll tell you, guys. I didn't feel much in there, but I do always enjoy the little wafers. Of course you do because you're consuming the actual body of Christ. Uh-huh, well, he was delicious. Wait, what? You're eating our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ every Sunday, that's You're telling me that you believe that Christ comes back to life every Sunday in the form of a bowl of crackers, and then you proceed to just eat the man? Correct, you consumed his corpse and you drank his blood; that's a part of Good, good, good, good. This is what we're dealing with. Hey, Mom. Can I talk to you for a second? Why are you here, honestly? I was praying for help. I need the money for Dr. Jinx. Dr. Jinx is a con artist and a lunatic. I-I know he's strange, but he's a great doctor. He really does cure people. Hey, guys, look at this. My rash is almost completely cleared up. Oh, my God. Whoa. Yeah, look at that. Whatever he sprayed on me worked. He might actually be a good doctor. Oh, shit. Hi, everybody, just a reminder if you wouldn't mind. We're asking for extra donations for the statue of the Blessed Mother that was vandalized last week. What the shit, man? Charlie. My mother is dying of cancer and you need money to fix a statue? No, no, no, no, don't give me this act. Charlie, calm down. No, no, no, why don't you give us some money, okay? How much is that ring worth? That looks like an expensive ring; can we have the ring? Okay, uh-uh, I'm sorry, Father, I will pray for his sins. I'm sorry. What are you doing? It's okay. I got this. What am I doing? What is he doing? No, listen, listen, listen. Don't get all riled up about this scam or that scam, you know. It's all a big scam, okay? Yeah. But I will say this, the church's scam? It's a pretty good one. It's effective. Look at all the money these people are giving to the church. So, I say we use that model to raise money for your mom at Paddy's. Guys, let's throw a beef and beer. A beef and beer-- it's been years. Beef and beer, huh? Yeah, we invite the members of this congregation down to Paddy's for cheap beef and watered-down beer. We'll prey on their Catholic guilt by playing up your mom's cancer and "Oh, she's dying," and she is, you know, and we'll raise a bunch of money to give to your mom to give to Dr. Jinx. It's the Holy Trinity: beef and beer and Jesus. FRANK: Dig, dig, dig. What makes you think she's got money buried in the dog's grave? Well, she can't use a bank. She's probably got money buried all over the city. Oop, there we go. Yeah, dig it up, dig it up. Come on, buddy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah. Aah, goddamn! Aw, there's a dead dog in there! Gross! That's not a dog. That's my toupee, my blond toupee. I used to wear this in Miami. She hated this goddamn thing. Oh, she didn't like that? No. You are an idiot. Oh, my God, there is some cash. That dirty whore. There's got to be, like, five grand in here. I bet she's probably got this stuff hidden all over the city. I can't believe this. She's alive. We better tell your brother Daryl 'cause he's gonna want to be in the loop. Dennis? Dennis, Dennis, goddamn it! Okay, shh. Frank, you're losing it! Stop it. Pipe down. People live here. My head is turning to soup. Okay, I get it. Hey, uh-uh, Mr Juarez. Mr. Juarez, that's right. You remember the Mexican family whose house we burned down and we had to give them our mansion. Oh, how do you like the mansion? Oh, it's been very, very nice. You know, the weddings, the quinceaÃ±eras, but it's very expensive. Uh, how you call it, uh, property tax. It's too much. Yeah. We had to leave. Anyway, I am back here every Saturday. Why? Oh, I have to go to work. Aw, shit. Well, that sucks. Tell you what. Property taxes-- paying for what you already own? Now, that's a scam.  We want the funk got to have the funk Oh, we want the funk We need it   Gotta have that funk We want the funk  Padre! So good to see you. So good of you to come. Oh Yeah, right on, right on. Well, it's for a good cause, isn't it? So have some beef, have some beer. And if you feel the calling, you know, go ahead and pop that ring in the donation bucket. Although I know you won't. All right. Have a good time. We're both playing the same game, I-I totally get it. I get what you're doing. Let me see the-the neck. Mom, turn your head that way. Can we do more lesions? No, dude, the lesions are fine. That's overkill. Trust me. I don't know why I have to wear all this makeup, and wear a bald cap. Mom, you want people to feel sorry for you, right? Then they give a lot of money. And you just don't look that sick. You gotta look sicker. But I feel like it's lying. Oh, it's not lying, Mrs. Kelly, because you are dying of cancer. Yeah. It's devouring your insides. But we need for it to devour your outside, so it plays better for our audience. Yeah, look, Mom, it's just basic Hollywood stuff, all right? Don't fight it. Why can't you get Frank to give me the money? Frank's not really like a big charity kind of guy. He's not really gonna give it. Okay. Let's talk about the speech, okay? Can you go over the speech that we gave you? I don't like this speech. This speech is too graphic. It it needs to be graphic to get their attention. This bitch is driving me crazy. I'm sorry. Look, that's the kind of stuff that's going to grab people, you know what I mean? Like graphic stuff, melt their Artemis, what are you doing? You can't smoke in here. It's not tobacco. I realize it's not tobacco, but it's not going to be good for her lungs. She's already I'm used to smoke around me. Oh She can recover. She can beat it. It's only going to add Can you go outside?! Whatever. I'm gonna go have some beef. Have some beef, but don't smoke in front of the woman. (applause)  We are Dr. Jinx  We are Dr. Jinx, and we'll be back in a minute. All right. All right, that's good stuff. Good stuff, hey everybody give it up one more time for Dr. Jinx, huh? (cheering) Dr. Jinx. The man with a band named after himself. Well, ladies and gentlemen, we all know why we're here. To celebrate the beautiful life of the beautiful Bonnie Kelly. But I'd like to take a moment, if-if you'll indulge me. I learned something very important today, and it just dawned on me. I want to talk about faith. Right on. It's not about whether something is true, or-or based in fact, or reality, or the laws of physics, or nature, or-or even basic common sense. It's about whether or not we're dumb enough to believe in it that matters. Oh, folks, who the hell am I to say that there is no God? Who am I? Or to say that anybody's belief in the church doesn't make their life better? Maybe it does. Or that this man, Dr. Jinx who am I to say that he can't cure diseases with his sorcery? I don't know. I say, maybe he can. And I believe that maybe he can. Ladies and gentlemen, if we believe if we just believe then we can do anything! (cheering) (whoops) Oh, yeah, ladies and gentlemen, I feel it now! Do you feel it? Do you feel the spirit? Do you feel the invisible things around you that don't really exist? Oh, it doesn't matter! Dr. Jinx feels it, yeah! Woo, I feel good! Yeah! We feel magnificent, yeah! And we can cure cancer with plants. (cheering) Amen. Mm, thank you so much. Thank you so much. Oh, oh-oh-oh. Dennis, that was amazing, dude. I am so proud of you. You are feeling again. No. I meant none of it. Let's go, Mom, come on. Just read the speech. I don't think I can do this. You-you can do it. You'll be great. My my mom has a speech! "Thank you all for coming to our Beef and Beer and Jesus. As you know, I'm as sick as a three-legged dog on the streets of India. Any minute, my lungs are going to sizzle, pop, and disintegrate into a liquid lung and organ gumbo soup." That was my line. Nice. Mm. (whispering): Charlie, I can't do this. Just get to the money part. All right, just get the money part done. "Give me money. Money me. Money now. Me a money needing a lot now." That was Charlie's line. Yeah. Eh. Charlie, I-I can't do this. Doing great. Doing great. I have a confession to make to all of you. Don't do it, bitch! I don't have cancer. What? (gasping) (murmuring) We're the ones that broke the Virgin Mary statue. We accidentally hit it with our car. Mm We were trying to raise money to get it fixed. That's just crazy. You could've just told me the story about hitting the statue. I mean, where did you come up with this idea? Well, I learned everything by watching you. Well, I Oh Aw, shit, I did do that, huh? Yeah, you totally you pulled that shit on us, too. Well You son of a bitch. That's no excuse. Yeah, well, at least you didn't try and grift a doctor, though. No, no, I never actually said I was a doctor. He is the goddamn church gardener. A gardener? I guess that would explain this. Oh! Oh, Jesus I was gonna talk to you about that. I'm really sorry. You had my back up against the wall, I had to spray you with a heavy dose of pesticide. Put some aloe vera gel on there, a little bit of vitamin D What? He doesn't know that. He doesn't know that. Don't get a diagnosis from him now. Why how would you know that? Goddamn it. Dennis. Dennis! Mom's alive. She faked her own death to steal Frank's money, and we think it's buried in her grave. That dirty whore. Everybody get a goddamn shovel! This is such a perfect place for that bitch to hide my money. Oh, Psychic John talked about this. He said I was gonna come into a windfall of cash, and it's all in here. Yeah, and then we can use some of that cash to pay for the statue that our moms broke, Charlie. All right! (coughing) You guys ready? Crack it open, Charlie. (chanting): Charlie, Charlie (chanting): Show me the money, show me the money (whooping) Ah, shit! (screaming) No! No! Mommy, Mommy! Ah! I grifted ya! What are you talking about? I paid off the psychic. I buried the money in the dog grave. (crying): My mommy, my mommy's a skeleton! I grifted your asses good because you said I was slipping. I feel too much! I feel too much! (sobbing) You made me dig up my dead mother because I said you were losing it? Score one for the old people. Ha ha! Wait a minute. What the hell happened to my shoes?                       Something outside the box. Come on, people. You agree with me. The shareholders meeting is next week. If we don't act fast, this company will be stripped down and sold for scrap. I say we cut a deal with the Wheeler Group. You want to make a deal with the people who are threatening to gut us? What choice do we have? No. There is one man who can save this company. Its founder. The man is from a different era. He's a Neanderthal, an animal. Yeah, and just the animal we need. Bring in the warthog. Hey, Frank, how do you know that these are crow's eggs? Because I saw a crow. Hurry up. I can't stay here much longer. Oh, my God, there's a whole untapped world of bird eggs that we're not even taking advantage of. Get the phone! Hello? Is this the warthog? I ain't heard that name in a long time. Five, four, three, two, one! Oh, boom, 24 hours is up. The found wallet is ours. Let's pop this bad boy open and see what we've won. Mr. Brian LeFeve from Quebec, you lose. Boom, I got your wallet. Boom, I got your credit cards. Boom, I got your money. Oh, shit. Is that Canadian? Ah, throw it in the trash. I'm not gonna throw it in the trash. Might be worth more than ours. We'll exchange it. What's this? Phillies ticket. For today! Oh, shit, looks like we're going to the Phillies game. Always check your breath. Right. And when you shake their hands, make sure your hands are bone dry. Dry hands. Never wet and clammy. I got it. Guys, quick announcement. I'm gonna be popping these crow's eggs in the fridge here so they don't spoil. Do not touch them. They are ours. We won't. Guys, why are you dressed like that? There's some scumbag company that's trying to take over the business that I founded, and I'm not gonna stand for that. Yeah, no, we're not gonna stand for that. Frank's taking me under his wing; he's gonna teach me how to swim with the sharks. Charlie can't read. He'll adapt. He'll adapt to reading? Okay, you know what, we don't need them, all right? We have plenty of fun things to do today, okay? That's right, while you guys are crunching numbers, we're gonna be soaking up some sun at the Phillies game, courtesy of one Mr. Brian LeFeve. Who the hell is that? The guy whose wallet we found at the bar. What are you gonna do if he comes looking for it? Uh, tell him to suck a boner. Exactly. Boom, I got your wallet. Boom, I got your credit cards. Boom, I got your Phillies tickets. Yeah, I've never been in Whoa. Oh, shit. Oh, my God. Awesome. Oh, fine dining and baseball food. There's more. Hey! Oh! Free batteries! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Calm down, calm down. What's in here? Free shit, free shit. Guys, calm down. Look at all these coasters. Jesus Christ. Act like you belong here. Now listen to me. The fact that we're in a box leads me to believe that there are definitely gonna be other people coming here today, and they're probably gonna be friends with this LeFeve guy. So we need to talk about an exit strategy. We don't want to get caught. Okay, exit strategy. All right, I'll run the op. This the only entrance and/or exit, therefore if somebody comes in, I will spring off the balcony to safety. No, no, no, no. That's a 50-foot drop. Yes, of course, and I'm a professional, so I will tuck and roll. Oh, you're gonna tuck and roll through a 50-foot drop? Dennis, if I had a gun with me, I'd be spraying bullets into the air as I fell. No, no, no, we don't have time for these types of scenarios, okay? I'm talking about coming up with a real plan, a real exit strategy. If we get caught, we could get in a lot of Excuse me, is one of you Brian LeFeve? Oh, uh, yeah, yeah, hi. It's nice to finally put a face to the name. I'm Andrew Kane. Of course. And Bill Larkin. Oh, Bill, okay, now see, from our conversations, I would have pegged you for Bill. Crazy? Oh, yeah, we get that sometimes. Yeah? And that must make you Prudence LeFeve. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Hi, honey. Hi. And you are? Vic Vinegar, bodyguard. I don't shake, so don't even try. Bodyguard? Yeah, I mean, he's really more of a driver. He drives us around. I protect their bodies. He protects the car. Well, I mean, we got all week to talk about business. So, uh, let's just kick back and watch this game, huh? Who needs a beer? I do. Oh, I'd love a beer. Thank you. Thank you. Vic, you're working. You're working. You are. A bodyguard, you got to drive, too, stupid. Yeah. Cheers. I'm not stupid. Not stupid. All right. Charlie, I want a list of the top ten shareholders of the company ASAP, and call the press. Put out a press release. Tell them the warthog is back in business. Also, there are too many minorities and women working here. What's up with that? I got all that. I'm on it. I'm on it. Excuse me, excuse me, who is this man? Charles Kelly. I'm gonna be advising the warthog in matters of business and all the what have you. Oh, everything. Right-hand man, you got it? I mean, there's gonna be some changes around here, you understand? Ah, look at this. This poor kid, nobody's helping him. Hey, hey, kid. What's happening? What is it? Sorry, sir. The darn thing won't print. You mind if I take a look-see? Oh, no. I think it's a paper jam. Yeah, there's the culprit. Thanks, Mr. Warthog. A jam, it was in the tray three, and you didn't check. It was hiding back there. It was like a little piece of paper. Let me Whoa, let me ask you a question. Did I just do your job for you? Excuse me? Did I? Did I just do your job for you? Uh, I-I guess so. You're fired. Get the hell out of here. Go on, pack your shit up and get out of here. If we're gonna turn this company around, we got to start cutting the crust off this shit sandwich. Fire in the hole, everybody. Come on, work. So, what do you think of our latest proposal, LeFeve? I think closing at 31's a pretty fair deal, don't you? tend to be a little complicated. Oh, I think ya can do better. Oh, you looked over the proposal? She glanced at it. We're not Tell us more about it. Yah, I sure did, and I tell you what, I seen better-looking moose turds in Rick Moranis' backyard, ya hosers. Mm? She's got a sense of humor that would just You know, it gets frustrating. Hey, come talk to me for a second. Excuse me, guys. Just What the hell are you doing, Dee? We're Canadian. You sound like a cartoon character. Guys, let's get out of here. Everybody's treating me like the help. Well, you should have thought about that before you blurted out, "bodyguard." Mm. Oh, I got an idea. Promote me to vice president. That way, we can talk shop. Mac, these gentlemen are courting me for my business savvy. How's it gonna reflect on me if I promote my bodyguard to VP after a two-minute conversation at a ball game? Mm-hmm. It's not gonna reflect on you at all because you're not Brian LeFeve. I'm not what? Dude, clearly you were floundering. Mac, I was gathering information so that I can more fully become this man. Look, look, this is about much more than just business. This is about the thrill of wearing another man's skin. Feeling his innermost wants and desires and being in control of his every single move. That's how you get off. Now don't you guys want to get off with me? I don't know. What? I want you to get off with me. Okay, okay. Just follow my lead. Guys, we're gonna get off together. Gentlemen, I'm just confused about one thing. Now, you got me out of bed, you put me on a plane, rolled out the red carpet for, what was it, 31? Vic, get my coat. Let's get out of here. Now hold on a second, LeFeve. Give us a shot. We will persuade you. Get ready for a great week. A little longer in the sock, huh? Higher in the thigh. So tell me the rundown for tomorrow, Charlie. Okay. We got a 8:30 appointment in the morning to play racquetball in these new outfits, then we're gonna head over to Barneys, we're gonna shop for Rolexes. After that, we zip by Atwater where you're having your office completely redone back to its former 1980's glory. And then we have a 5:00 sushi dinner with Mr. Nakashori. That all sound right? Whoo! Sounds great, Charlie. Good. Well, Frank, I'm a little confused about one thing. What's that? Who pays for all this? What do you mean, who pays for it? The company pays for it. All right, well, then here's my second question. What does Atwater make? What do you mean, like, how much money does the company make? Oh, no, I mean what do we make? I don't follow. We make money. No, I know we make money. I mean, what do we create? We create wealth. No, no, I mean, what do we build, what do we design, you know? Because I have some ideas that could really help the company. Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, we don't build anything. Leave that to the Chinks. Speaking of which, I want this sushi dinner to be the tits. Oh, okay, so you want it to be, like, really expensive. No, I want to eat sushi off of some Jap broad's tits. Hmm. All right, guys, listen, I whipped us up a couple of backstories here, so take a look at these cards. On the front, you're gonna find your biographical information. On the back, that's your emotional blueprint. Hmm. I have my own backstory, Dennis. I'm an entrepreneurial bodyguard with his own line of fitness products. I want to pitch the guys out. No, no, guys, guy, please, you got to trust me, okay? Just follow my lead, and I am gonna get you off in ways you never believed existed. I'm in. I'm not. I don't even know what you're talking about. I just want to do some business stuff. No. Okay, LeFeve, we have a surprise you are gonna love. Ah, really? Trust me, we know exactly what you like. Head on down to the members' locker room and see for yourself. Dennis, I have business savvy. I can be more than just the bodyguard, okay? I've got ideas. Oh, you got ideas? Pitch me one of your ideas right now. Right now? Off the top of my head? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, bodyguards. What about bodyguards? Training bodyguards, putting them in a facility and What about them? Oh, what about a resort? That's a totally different thing. Are you saying that because we're in a resort? Stick to the one thing. What about bodyguards? A resort for bodyguards? Oh, my God. Oh, hey, you must be Mr. LeFeve? Uh, yeah, that's me. Surprise. I'm all yours. I was told there'd just be one, but I can take both of you. Might get a little sore, but I'll manage. Okay, well, I'm out of here. Okay. Wait. What? Hey, hey, where you going? LeFeve's into banging little Asian boys, so we're done, right? If we're gonna do this thing, we need to see things through. Dennis, are you gonna have sex with a tiny Asian boy?

Uh, there's been an abundance of crow eggs all around Philly. Uh, and crows seem to be getting bigger. By the year and the day, even. And their eggs, of course, are getting bigger as well.

Well, that was good, Charlie. That's good. But you keep talking about products and quality and-and making things I'm sorry. You're out. Well, thanks for the insider info, Mac, but that did not work. Frank canned me. He did? Yeah! What a dick! You know Dennis wouldn't even listen to my business ideas? Are you serious? I'm brimming with all these great business ideas. Oh, tell me about it. I don't know what to do with it. Oh, my God, I pitched so many good ideas or I tried to, at least. And Frank shoots 'em down, 'cause he doesn't care about I wish we could go into business together, you know? That would be that would be good, it would make sense. Yeah, well, I feel like you and I you and I understand each other. We click, you know? I have to warn you, though, that it's all about the product for me.
 Are you serious?
 Yeah. That's what I was saying to Frank the entire time. That's what people care about, is the product. It's all about the product, right? He only cares about money. Money has nothing to do with it. It's about a Oh You and I are on the same page. I know, we're always clicking with And we have insane business savvy, and I feel like Excuse me. I need to speak to the owners. Yeah, that's us. Yeah, yeah. Does the name Brian LeFeve mean anything to you guys? Okay, LeFeve, enough. We took you out the yacht, we took you to the zoo, we took you to that massage parlor and paid to have them jerk you both off. The meeting's about to start. We need to know, are you going to sell or not? Guys, we are almost there. I promise you, we are so close. Oh, okay! All right, I want to welcome all of you Atwater investors, and especially our controlling shareholder, Mr. Brian LeFeve. Thanks, Frank. Oh. Thank you. All right. I'm very excited about your passion for the company, so let's get right down to business. Not so fast! There's something you all need to know about Atwater! Prepare to have your minds blown. We got a video. Boom! Huh? What up? Are you ready for the best idea ever? Do you have money? Do you want even more money? Well, guess what? We've got a great idea for you. I no, I told you not to stay out of my peripheral through the whole two, one. Fight Milk! The first alcoholic, dairy-based protein drink for bodyguards By bodyguard! I drink it every morning so I can fight like the crow. Just get out of the way. There we go. It's all about the product shot. Where do I stand? Don't do the whole I wanted for them to see the whole Fight Milk! Crow's egg! Milk! Made fresh. By bodyguards. And Charlie. What up? Watch as profits soar high as a crow. Watch your profits soar high as a crow. Ow. Sorry. Wait, I thought we said I was gonna Profits Yeah, go with your right. To the right hand. Uh, anyway, who wants to invest? So what's this got to do with Atwater? Oh, nothing. No, um, we just didn't want to lead with the Atwater news because we figured you wouldn't stick around to watch the video. So what's the news? Oh! Yeah, right. Well, that's not Brian LeFeve! This is Brian LeFeve. Yeah. Yeah, apparently he came to the bar to talk to Frank, and I didn't recognize him from his picture in his wallet, but I did recognize it when I saw that dead face in the morgue. Yeah, I was like, I remember that dude, yeah. Yeah. He came to the bar, and I remember he had to take a piss. Yeah, he was having a couple drinks and then But Charlie was in the bathroom cleaning it out. I was working. I'm like, "Dude, take it out to the alley." And then I guess he's out in the alley, he comes back in, he forgot his wallet. Mac's like, "ID please." Yeah, he doesn't get in without an ID. That's just the rule. The guy's got no ID, so now he's roaming around the alleyway looking for his wallet. Crackhead comes up to him, says, "Hey, man, give me your money." And the guy's like, "I can't, I got no money." And he's like, "Bullshit." He got stabbed a bunch around the abdomen and uh, kind of bled out and sort of died. Why do you got his finger? Oh. Well, the whole finger thing is This was a miscommunication. This is a stupid thing, man. This guy here He's like, "Dude, get a fingerprint." And I heard, "Get a fingertip." And I chopped his finger off really quick and then I'm like, "Is this what you want?" He starts screaming, you know. Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. If Brian LeFeve is dead then who the hell are these people? Just a couple of people who totally got off, bro. What? You did? Mm Are you serious? Mm-hmm, yeah. Just during this? Big time, yeah. Oh, yeah, I got off a couple times when we were watching the video presentation. Then when he called me out for not being Brian LeFeve? Whoo, that got me big time. That did it? Oh, man, did I get off. Yeah, and then he showed the finger.
 That was the big one.
 A dead finger got you off.
 That was the climax, really.
 I am so confused. Oh, my God, it was amazing. It was mostly sexual. God damn you, okay? You know what? I could've gotten some cash out of these men. I could've gotten a free pair of shoes, but no, you said, "Hang in there, I'll help you get off, I'll help you get off, Dee. I'll show you how to do it." And then you leave me all on my own to try and just get off all by myself without even I did everything that I could. I don't understand why you couldn't get off. It's not my fault. Some women just don't know how. What?! I don't know what it is. You know? Sometimes it's only the guy who gets off. Well, look, I don't know what the hell's going on over there. But I can tell you something, that there is something really, palpable, wonderful going on over here. I love this company. I love it more than life. I built this company with these hands. Built it from the ground up. This is a comp Excuse me. Hello? It's done? Oh. Good. Right. All right, that's it. It's over, you can all go. The company's gone. What are you talking about? I stripped the company, sold it to the Chinks, and they shut it down. In a sense, you're all fired. Out. You can all go. Thank you, and good-bye. Get out, get out, go. Frank, whoa, whoa. I dude, I do not understand. I thought you loved the company. I do. But not more than money. And I just made a shitload of it. You get it? Yeah. See, Charlie? Speaking of which, tell me more about this Crowtein.                      You were disrespectful to me. That's the past. God, get a life. This is my life, bitch. You bitch! Aw, you slut. Ah, hold still, Charlie-- you're flickering. Sorry, it's I'm trying to get you good images, but I keep getting shocked a little bit. Well, don't let that affect your work. No, I'm really trying not to. It's just that, you know, I have to run the wires from the other building Building and, you know, there's asbestos in the ducts, which Good for breathing, so I'm tired. Why are you watching this crap? Come on, turn the TV off. Let's go out, let's do something-- I'm bored. Hey, let's go dancing, huh? I want to do something. Dancing? We're watching Real Housewives. You know, there's nothing real about this shit, Frank. You know that, come on. Real women don't even look like that. Hey, guys. That is what real women look like. Dee, are you sick? No, I feel great. Oh, I haven't had a chance to shower for a few days. I've been gaming like a loon. You've been what? Gaming-- I've been playing this online video game. It is awesome. Charlie, speaking of which, you want to come play my avatar for a little bit while I run some errands? I don't want my crops to die. Nah, I'm kind of busy working for the guys at the ele Shit! Yes, he's working for us. He will do nothing of the sort. We're going dancing. Come on! What if I give you three bucks? Hey, you're our employee. You do what we say. I pay your rent. Do not drop those wires! Hey, Charlie, to live is to dance. Let's go. Charlie, what if I gave you five bucks? You owe me five bucks! Ah, shit! Screw it! Son of a bitch! Shit! All right, I'll tell you what. I'm gonna go with Dee, okay? But I'm getting sick of this shit, I really am. You treat me like a dumb-dumb and a grunt, and I have potential, you know? I can go places, I can do things. Who knows? I might even rule the world one day. Rule the world, huh? Yeah, if that happens, I'll blow myself. Okay, so it's called TechPocalypse, right? And we're post-apocalypse, and we have to rebuild civilization. This is me, ZingingCutie23. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down! ZingingCutie 23. Are you pretending that you're 23 years old?
 No.
 It seems like it. No, I It's I It's a random number that I picked. It's a random number? It's a number to put at the end of that. You know what? Just watch over my tribe, and make sure nobody, you know, takes it over, and I'll give you your money, okay? Okay. Okay. Wait. Hold on a second. What is that? That's you. You're one of my subjects. That's me. Why am I in the game? Is that Mac? Of course that's Mac. You guys are all here. See, Mac's my handmaiden. How do you do? How do you do? And Dennis is a midget blacksmith. Frank is a mutant half-donkey. And you're my jester. Why am I eating out of a trough? Made sense. Are you kidding me? So let me get this straight. You've been playing this game for, like, a week straight just so you feel like you lord over all of us? Is that what this is? Charlie, do you want your five bucks or not? I want my five dollars. It's just pathetic, Dee. Okay, well, maybe it is. Maybe it isn't. I really do need the money, though. Yeah, well, then get to work. Can you give me an advance? No, not in advance. We'll see how well you do. All right, I got this. I got this. Yeah. See, this is what I'm talking about, guys, huh? I mean, playing online video games and watching stupid reality shows-- that's not real life. It's keeping people from experiencing real life. Yeah? This is real. It's real, but it feels weird as shit. There's nobody else in the bar dancing. We're setting the tone, Frank. Yeah, we will lead, and others will follow. I'm stopping. Oh, come on, don't stop. Look, all right, let's go do some shots, and that will get you guys fired up, and we'll come back out, and we'll do some more of this or whatever. You know, you can do the move, and well, come on, come on, come on, come on. Hey, uh, bartender, three shots of whiskey, come on. Hey, I know you guys. You're the donkey man and the princess, right? We don't know what you're talking about. Take a hike, Bozo. Geek. Check it out. Look at this. This is this is you, right? This-this is Frank and-and Mac from ZingingCutie's tribe? What the hell is this? This is Dee's online video game, and she's created characters for all of us. She's humiliating us virtually. Who cares? It's a video game. What do you mean, who cares? This is starting to piss me off. Stop getting invested in fake realities. Let's live real life! Well, Dennis, my anger feels very real. Are you feeling it? Are you feeling it? Yeah, well, it's not real. It's not. I-I-I I'm angry. Okay, it's not real, and you know what it also isn't? It also isn't epic, okay? And you know what is epic? Doing these shots, going out there and dancing. Come on, do it, do the shots. I'll do the shots. I'll just do the shots. How about that? Mm-hmm. Oh, somebody got a smart phone. Okay, you know, I tell you what, Carl. Let's settle for a C trade. We'll call it a day on that. I got to run. ZingingCutie44 is back, so I'm out. Changed your name. What the hell are you doing, Charlie? I told you to just feed my crops. I did, I fed your crops, and then I gathered some rocks, and I built a little wall around your tribe. Then I used the leftover rocks to dam the river so that you could fish. Now you're doing well in the game. You sucked at it, all right? All you did was spend your money on stuff you don't need, just like in real life. I don't do that in real life. Yes, you do. What did you get at the store? I bought a smart phone so that I can play the game on the go. What's going on with the fingernails? Well, I had those done like Flo-Jo. Why?! It's craziness. I just thought it would be funny. I Dee, this is your problem. I could take this money, I could feed myself for a month. I would buy milk, I would buy flour, I'd buy vitamins, I'd boil them down to little energy balls to sustain me, but whatever. Forget it. Enjoy your game, enjoy all your new followers, and you're welcome. Oh, shit! Charlie, you got me 31 new followers? Yeah. That's amazing! Hey, do you want to maybe team up? No, 'cause I don't want to be a slave. Come on, Charlie, please. I need you. It's, like, when I'm doing good in the game, I'm doing good in life. Oh, I want to make fun of you for saying that, but I kind of know what you mean. It's like I'm thriving. You are thriving. Yeah, I did feel that, and I You felt that? I did, I felt that, you know, and I never get to thrive. I want to be the guy who thrives for once. Right? Me, neither. All right, I'll tell you what-- make me your king, and let's get rocking. Ew, no. I don't want to do that 'cause we'd have to be married, and that would be awful. Oh, okay, I'll see you later. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Sit down, sit down, sit down. I'll make you my king; just accept my request to consummate. Consummate? What is that? Have sex. Oh. So, um, we should have sex then? In the game. Yeah, in the game, sure, yeah. Yeah. Either way. Uh, so, push enter hard, or one, like, slow push, and you do your thing, or a little circular action? Just push the button, Charlie. Just push the button. That was good, right? Was it? I think. You see me, Frank, you see me coming? I see you, I see you. Oh, here comes another guy. I'm gonna fight him. Mac attack! Fight! I lost again! Goddamn it, how do I keep losing? I'm huge. Stop fighting every guy in the game. The fighting is the best part. It's the only reason I'm playing. Oh, my God, will you guys please shut up? I'm hungover as shit. We're playing TechPocalypse. Mac is a soiled fool, and I am a gorgeous girl with big cans and I'm banging all the fishermen in sight for fish and I'm also being catty with all the women in the game, like I'm a Real Housewife. Look, Dennis, I-I'm six-foot- ten. I have always wanted to be six- foot-ten. Hey, look, Mac, you're five- foot-nine, and Frank, you're a man-- an ugly, old man! You're not understanding this, Dennis, but I think I have something that could help you wrap your head around it. I've never had my hair cut in a bedroom. Well, one thing I've learned from cutting hair all these years, Danielle, is you don't have to go to a high-end salon to get a high-end salon-quality cut. Little spritz? Why are we watching Dennis' sex tape? Shh. It's cold. I know. Well, we'll make it hot in a minute, don't worry about that. Well, don't Well, it's always-- there's always so much, so much preamble. Okay, here we go. Okay. Oh, oh, um, all right. All right. Whoa. Now, Dennis, how does this make you feel? Powerful. Yes, of course, but how does it affect you sexually? I'm very aroused right now. I, too, am aroused. I'm starting to swell up. Yeah. See, now all three of us are aroused, and there's not a woman in the room. See, this is no different than sports or video games. It's all a virtual experience. No, no, no, bullshit, this was real, okay, this happened, I did this. All right, I drew this woman in, I styled her hair, I entered her with almost no resistance. I did these things. You say it's real, but what even is reality? Yeah, who knows? We don't even know if we're in this room. We could be in a turtle's dream in outer space. What are you talking about? I'm gonna go out into the real world again today and have real experiences. I'm gonna draw those people in to me, okay? A turtle's dream. That's crazy, lunacy. So, tell me something, Queen of Thrones, how about we stop being enemies, we start becoming friends here, huh? Charlie, I just got a new nose and I'm flying to Miami to get my lips inflated. Can you hang on one second? What, Dee, what are you buying? How are you paying for that? We have plenty of money. I know we have money. We have money because I All right, you know what? Yes, fine, buy your lips, buy your noses, buy whatever you're gonna buy. All right, don't interrupt me when I'm running our tribe, okay, 'cause that's kind of a big deal. I know, I'm sorry. All right, so don't interrupt. Okay. Do me a favor, refill my bowl of energy balls, okay? Please make yourself useful. Sorry about that, Queen of Thrones, let me step into my office here. Hey, bitch! Frank, you are SweetPeaches69? How did you get so many followers? What can I say? Some girls are more popular than others. Are you wearing a mink coat? What, this old thing? Guy gave it to me for going down on him. I've been getting a lot of gifts lately. I just got sent a whole box of peaches-- real ones. I'm eating like a goddamn islander. I'm living a pretty classy life these days. Ooh, you should come to my party. I'm gonna meet a lot of my online friends there. It's gonna be a very classy affair, but you can come anyway. Well, look, we can sit here, we can talk cheesesteaks all day long, but maybe you and I could get together at my bar, settle this thing once and for all. Charlie, we got to talk. Whoa. We're going to a party-- a real one-- Frank's throwing it. Yes, I know what's going on. I know everything that's happening. Do you know he has a bunch of followers? Do you know that he's parading around in a mink coat, and he humiliated me? I'm a queen, okay? I should be the one wearing mink and I should be throwing digs at him. You know what I mean? I should have a lot more followers. You want mink, Dee, you want a mink coat? You want a nice, real mink coat, not a virtual one like Frank? Don't dick around with this. Are you serious? I am dead serious. I trade with a guy online; he has a clothing store. I'm sure I could give him some crops, maybe a follower or two, and he'll give you a mink coat. For me? Would you like that? I would love that. You, you would like that, wouldn't you? You know how that's not gonna happen? What? It's not gonna happen if I'm not playing the goddamn game! Because when I'm not playing the game, people are attacking our tribe, okay, and that's a lot of pressure, that's a lot of stress. It's too much for you. And we could lose everything, we could lose everything that we have worked for-- everything! I wasn't thinking. No, you're not really the thinking kind, though. I'm kind of the thinking one in the relationship, so Right, thank you. Be pretty, you know, talk to me right. Yeah. Get my energy balls. Unbelievable. Hey, Charlie, we need to talk, dude. Well, well, well, if it isn't the soiled fool. Frank told you about that? Uh, no, everyone's talking about it online; it's hilarious. You destroyed your computer, you bashed it to bits. I'm assuming it got you in the eye-- is that what's going on there? It bashed me back a little bit. Yeah, you should win those fights, you shouldn't lose I did win, I did win, it just got a couple of good shots in. It did, yeah. Hey, Charlie, hey, listen, I want to tell you something. Um, Dee Yeah? You're not going to offer our guest any? Of course I-- of course, that's what I was doing. Yeah. Hey, Mac, hey, did you, did you want an energy ball or two? Yeah. Go ahead, have as many as you want-- is that enough? That's-- yeah, that's good. There you go, okay. Okay, you need to fuel up. Have a bunch of balls. Yeah, I do, thank you. Okay, thank you. Okay-- don't touch. No, now I know. Right, yeah. I didn't mean that. And stop groveling, just Let me know if you need You're not pretty when you do that, so Wow, you, like, totally psychologically, like, annihilated her. Yeah. You're good at building, I'm good at destroying. We should totally team up. Wait, you know what? Can you do me a favor? Can you watch her for a little while while I go meet a girl that I met online? A real girl? Yeah, a real girl. She's probably fat, right? Probably very fat, yeah. If she's got any fat friends, I'm, I'm in. If she has any fat friends, I'll let you know. Or ugly. Yeah, or ugly. If they're sick, that's fine, too. Yeah, or ugly or sick or, or male or female or whatever it is that you like. That's not the point. Like, the point is, you know how women get. You know, she catches wind that I'm meeting a girl, she's going to go Oh, totally, totally. I hate women. Yeah, I-I know that you feel that way, but do what I'm asking and then I can help you out with the game. Okay, do what? Watch Dee. Oh, okay, yeah. Hello, hi. Anyone? Come on, hello, hi. God, it's unbelievable. Does anybody want to experience this? Anyone want to experience me? For real? Oasis Sensory Deprivation. Enter a new dimension. Change your perception. Experience a new reality. Experience a new reality. Stop getting invested in fake realities! I'm six foot, ten. You're five foot, nine. What even is reality? This is real. How do you do? We could be in a turtle's dream in outer space. What is real? Is this real? Am I? Who are you? Oh, I'm you. Huh. That's an amazing accent. I like yours as well. I think I know what reality is, but maybe I don't. Everything in life is becoming more and more virtual. Aw, don't be such a wanker. Life is all in your mind. If you believe it to be real, then it's real. I'm so confused, British Dennis. You create your own reality. I've known beggars to be kings and kings to be beggars, all because they believed it so. It's your choice. It's my choice. It's your universe. It's my universe. And you are God. I am God. Oh oh oh, no okay. Shh, shh, shh, shh. Charlie? Hey. Julie, right? The Queen of Thrones! The second most powerful player in the game. And you are the Mighty Rat Slayer. 'Tis I, 'tis I! It's nice to meet you! Yeah, I'm sorry I'm sorry, I haven't had a chance to tidy myself. You know, when you're playing the game, you get caught up and Have a seat! Have a seat! Wow, this is It's cool to meet someone from the game, you know? I brought you something. You did? It's nothing, really. It's just, um the best cheesecake in Philadelphia. You dog! Uh, I'll be the judge of that, all right? You little rascal, you. Uh, I don't normally meet people from the game, but you seem like such a nice guy. Thanks, yeah, yeah, you know This is embarrassing, but I got you something too, you know? I don't want I don't want to make you feel weird but here. Oh, how thoughtful. I wonder what it is. It's not much. Just a box of spiders. What the hell? Well, while we've been sitting here, my followers have burned your land, they've raped your people, and they've destroyed your tribe. You thought you could make a move on me, Queen of Thrones? Well, you were wrong. What? I just wanted to have lunch with you. Oh, right. Oh, let's have lunch because we're hungry and we want to eat food. Bullshit! You think I'd give up all this for lunch? You stupid, fat pig. I'm not fat. No, you're not fat, but you were you were supposed to be. My friend Mac said you would be fat. Whatever. You're a dick. And your breath smells like dog food. Whatever, you bitch! I got the power now! I'm doing good in the game, so I'm doing good in life! Oh, look who's here. Well, it's nice that you came. A little overdressed. You said that this was a classy affair, Frank. It was a classy affair until you showed up. You bitch! Where are your 101 Dalmatians tonight? He's better at the zings than you! All right, Dee, give me your phone, give me your headset-- I got to get back online ASAP. I just made some big things happen. Big things, baby! Boom! No. She's not with you anymore, bro. Hold on. Shut up. Wh-Why is the soiled fool talking to me? I don't need you anymore, Charlie. I'd like a divorce. Ooh! Juicy! Wait, what are you talking about? I know you were gonna leave me for the Queen of Thrones, so I've slept with Mac to humiliate you. She's humiliated you and herself by sleeping with me. I'm good at the game now. Oh, my God, Dee, you stupid idiot. Do you do you have a brain in your head? I was tricking that girl, so that I could destroy her tribe. We're the most powerful tribe in the whole game now! What are you doing?! Uh you know, I-I guess maybe I hadn't really thought the whole thing through. No, you didn't think! Because you don't think! You're just a stupid kept housewife, okay? Zing it, girl! Frank, shut the hell up! How dare you all conspire against me? How dare you?! You know what, I want everyone out. Everyone get out of my apartment, okay? No, not you, not you, and not you. The three of you, sit! Get out! Okay, I think we can all agree that this game is the most important thing that ever happened to us, right? Absolutely, yeah It's very important That's the truth. It's a hugely important thing! So because I'm a nice guy, you know, 'cause I'm a cool dude, I'll let you live, all right? But, Mac and Frank, you got to give me your shares of Paddy's Pub. Done! What? Yes! And, Dee, you're gonna have to do all the Charlie-work in the bar from here until-- oh, I don't know-- how's eternity sound? Stop This game has gone on long enough. Uh, shit. Are you doing an accent? Yeah, I was doing a British acc It was a British accent. That was British?! Yeah, I had it so good in my head-- uh, I was doing a really good British accent. Doesn't matter. Anyway Charlie, you think you have all the power? Well, you don't. You see, the only thing bigger than a king is a god. You think you're a god? I'm the one who's thriving, Dennis. I mean, look at me. You look like you're covered in Hawaiian Punch. Yeah? Yeah. Eh. I am the god of my own universe, Charlie. I decide my own reality, and I've decided all of your realities as well. So, you see, I unplugged it. You unplugged reality? I don't understand what he's saying. Me neither. I just I deleted all of your characters from the game. What? I erased all your people. H-How did you do that? Well, it was easy. You guys all have the same password, "paddyspub." Oh, that's my password for everything. Mine, too. Why would you do that though? Why would you delete our characters? Because the goddamn game was irritating to me. I thought it was really stupid, and it really is just, you know, sort of that simple, so I ended the game, you know. That's the end. Doesn't have to be a whole big thing every single time, you know. That's life. That's just sort of how-how shit goes. Sometimes things just sort of end.  All night long   All night                         Pretty crowded tonight, huh? Yeah, well, it's Gugino's, you know, best restaurant in Philadelphia. To our monthly dinner. Oh, monthly dinner, baby. I tell you, I've been looking forward to this for 29 days! Me, too. I did my hair good, and I wore two colognes. Is that what that is? Mm. That was an interesting choice, but I get it, dude. You're excited. You are excited about tonight. Hey, hell, I'm excited tonight, you know? Not terribly excited about being near the kitchen, though. Really? It's where the action is. Maybe we'll get lucky and watch one of these dumb-ass waiters spill spaghetti sauce all over himself. And fall down or something. Okay, all right. Well, let's not be childish. Let's-let's keep it classy. You know, let's Classy. I can do classy. I can be classy. Did you invite Frank and Charlie? No, I didn't. Hi. Hi. How many will you guys be? Two. And give us a nice table. This is a big night for us. We're celebrating our anniversary. Or the anniversary of us moving in together, which is like an anniver-- it's been a long time. Anniversary is what it is, really. Well, great. Uh oh, okay, oh, okay, uh You can just hand that to me. I was trying to feel your breast. I got that. Yeah, but he was trying to feel your breast and give you the tip so that we got a good table. I want a good table. Oh, hey. Hey, hey, hey! Mac and Dennis are here. Should we sit with them? Really? Mm, Charlie, this is our night. Yeah, but we could all celebrate it together. That'd be fun. We can do our thing. They can do their thing. I'm sure at some point they'll come over to pay tribute. We can say hi to them then. That's weird. I know Charlie sees me, but they seem to be sitting at their own table. Well, good. Good, they should sit at their own table. Look, I'm sure at some point they'll come over and they'll pay tribute to us. They know it's our monthly dinner. We can say hi to them then. Yeah, still, seems kind of awkward, though. No. Look, we spend every waking minute together. It will be good for us to keep our distance for once. It's one minor coincidence. Doesn't go any further than that. Goddamn it. Of all the goddamn nights. Can't believe they haven't come over to pay me tribute yet. I was here first. I know they see me. They're probably over there right now making fun of me. I get it, guys. You know what they're doing? They're calling me "Scarecrow." 'Cause I'm all alone in the cornfields, scaring away the other birds. Real funny. You know what? There's no shame in a woman, an adult woman, taking herself out to dinner, enjoying her own company-- I'm not gonna leave. I'm not gonna leave because I don't have to, and also I can't because I have a Groupon for this evening that expires tonight. It does expire tonight, doesn't it? Uh, yeah. I Yes, it does. I'm sorry. Are you going to order now? Well, I'm trying to have a conversation with you. Why don't you sit down for a little while? Take a break. Oh! Are you almost off? Are you off soon? Should you sit and have dinner with me tonight? No, got a long shift. Uh, I cannot do that. Uh, maybe I could at least get a drink order? We're really busy tonight. Does the Groupon cover drinks? Nope. Just the tap water, then. I can't believe this. They still haven't paid tribute. It's been ten minutes. Not a wave, not a nod. Have you seen them do anything to acknowledge us? I thought we agreed that we would not let it get to us. It's not getting to me. It's just, you know, a little bit rude, is all I'm saying. It's, you know, irritating. Whatever, I don't care. I'm I'm over it. 'Kay. How good is their table, though? Oh, um Don't-don't look directly at them. Jesus Christ, just, you know, glance around the room a little bit, and just, you know, land on them. Glance around the room? Yeah. Too obvious! Well, how do you want me to look at them? With your eyes, just look with your eyes. Be subtle, be small. My eyes, they slant down. I don't have a good peripheral. Okay, can you just be subtle? It's a good table. It's a good table. How'd they get a better table than us? Uh, I don't know. Dennis, can we just focus on us? Yeah. It's our monthly dinner, all right? Don't let them ruin it. Okay? I have some issues that I want to talk to you Aw, shit. Really? No, I Look, let's-let's keep things light; I don't want to get all heavy. Let's not let tonight become more unpleasant than it's already become, okay? I mean, already I'm irritated. I'm I'm already sitting in the wobbliest chair in the entire restaurant. All right, well, we'll just ask the waiter for a book of matches. I don't want to sit on a pile of matches. Look, I'll just scoot back. It's fine. It's fine. Oh, but now I feel like you're sitting so far away from me. It's gonna be fine! This is a perfectly suitable distance for us to have our monthly dinner. Goddamn it. I am so sorry. Are you?! His chair's wobbly. Oh, okay. Let me get you a book of matches to put under there. I don't want to sit on a pile of matches. Dennis, it's not like your chair's gonna catch on fire. Oh, Christ, I'm not worried about my chair catching on fire. Look, sir, can you just get us a better table in general? Unfortunately, no. We're fully booked tonight due to a Groupon deal. Oh, that sounds excellent. We'll have one of those. No, we won't. We don't need a coupon. Frankly, I'm disappointed in you people. This is Gugino's. You're supposed to be the nicest restaurant in Philadelphia. Here I am, a regular, a full-paying customer, and I'm sat by the kitchen on the wobbliest chair in Philadelphia. You know, forced to eat dinner with this swarm of coupon-waving trash. This is crazy! You know what? Forget it, doesn't matter. Get me a pile of matches to sit on-- that'll be fine. Okay. No, wait, wait, wait. There's more. There's an old, short, fat man here. He's sat with his young sleeping partner. Bring them a glass of the house red from us. Of course. Although the table did just order cocktails, so maybe I don't need their entire life story. Just go get the wine. Well, that was a nice gesture. Was it? Charlie. Hmm? Stop looking over there. Can we just go over and say a quick hello, all right? Then it's done with. There's no more awkwardness. Charlie, I am the oldest one in the group. If anybody's gonna say a quick hello, it's them to me. I just feel like it's gonna become a bigger deal than it needs to be, you know? Then forget it. Yeah? This is our night, Charlie. All right. Listen. I prepared a few words for the evening. All right? Okay. All right. Charlie, I want to talk about where we are. Where we've been. And where we're going to be. Where are we going? Don't interrupt. Living with you has changed my life. I-I used to be unaware Hi, sorry to bother you. What are you doing, man? I'm in the middle of something here. Get out of here! Of course. I just wanted to deliver a glass of our house red from the two gentlemen near the kitchen. Beat it. Well, great. See, there's your tribute, Frank. Awesome. Now can we go over and say a quick hello? No, no. I'm in the middle of saying some words to you. Yeah, but you said 'em, and they were weird, like All right, you know what? How about I just stand and I bow? No. Ignore them. This is ridiculous. I mean, that was a very nice gesture. Was it? One glass of wine for two people, and house red? That wasn't nice. They're just trying to agitate us. Mm. Well, two can play at that game. Hey. Ooh, hey! You, help. Over here. Me? Yeah, yeah, yeah, you, please. Help. Help me. Sit, sit, please sit. Help. Is everything okay? No, everything's not okay. There are men here, and they're watching me. Oh, shit! Shh! Just look at me, just look right at me. Everything's gonna be fine, but I'm in a lot of shit. Okay? So I need your help. Oh, good. You have a friend. Hi. Can I take your order now? Yes. I'm not with her. There is some shit going down right now. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. He's just Please, let's order. Look, you told me you was in trouble. I don't know what's happening here. No, it's okay, I'm fine. Do you want to split an appetizer? No, I don't need this shit. Well oh. You know, if you just order, we can get your food out really quickly, and you wouldn't have to be embarrassed about being here alone for very long. All right? I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I-I'm gonna go ahead and order when I'm goddamn good and ready to order. Is that table having a meal consisting only of loud noise, screams, and hollers? Uh, they seem to be celebrating something. Ooh, could be a tactical victory. What do you think? Sure. Whoo! Okay, how's the chair now? Still wobbly. Why don't you just get me a new chair? I don't think it's the chair. You don't think it's the chair? Well, maybe my old pal, uh, Abraham Lincoln begs to differ. Oh, okay, yeah, uh You can just hand it to me. Hello. Your waiter. Great. Hi. Can you get him a new chair? Sure. Oh, oh! Maybe this George Washington will make it come here faster. Okay. This wine is for you. Ah, management sent us a bottle to accommodate us. Actually, it was your friends over at the other table. And they wanted me to relay to you that it's our most expensive bottle. They said to say that. That's a classy move. I'm gonna stand up and bow. No. Do not stand and bow. Let me think. We've got to do something in return. Mm-hmm. I'll tell you what. We'll send it back. You know? We'll say, we don't want that. You know? We'll-we'll tell them that, uh, what is it, Chilean wine is out of season, and that their taste in wine in general is very poor. No, that's we got to be more subtle than that. I don't want them to know that we're thinking about them. What are you doing? What are you doing? Are you staring at them? Yeah, dude, Charlie's looking right at me. Stop it. Dude, stop it. Okay, stop looking, stop All right, you know what, goddamn it? I'm just gonna pour the wine out. Goddamn it! That son of a bitch is pouring out my wine. Look can you just let it go, Frank? Okay? You're ruining this night for me, okay? I-I'm sure he had a perfectly good reason for pouring out a glass of wine. I want to go over there. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Just like he had a perfectly good reason for not inviting you to dinner. He had a good Wait. What do you mean by that? Don't make me say it, Charlie. I know you're not as dumb as you seem. Well, let's just say that I am. Those two guys don't give a shit about you, Charlie. You bought a business together; they made you a janitor. Eh, they didn't make me a janitor; there was a Mm? Oh, my God. It's time to fire back. Aw, I gotta get over there. Hi, ma'am. Sorry to bug you again. Oh, my God. I'll just take a plate of spaghetti. Oh, great. Didn't expect that. Uh, actually, I was coming over to see if I could take your chair. What? No. What for? I'm trying to accommodate that gentleman over there. Oh, goddamn it. Uh, that's a dig. All right, fine. Take the chair, but I tell you what, when you're over there? Tie his shoelaces together. You want me to tie a customer's shoelaces together? Uh Look, I'm in the biz, guy. I'm a waitress, okay? Look, let's team up and stick it to that guy. It'll be hilarious. I would lose my job. Uh "Oh, no, I-I would lose my job. And I wouldn't be able to work at Gugino's anymore, and my family, and they'd be so disappointed 'cause they're currently so proud of my accomplishments." I mean, God, lighten up, guy. I'm gonna take the chair. Fine, take the goddamn chair. Just don't make a big scene. How's the new chair? Oh, it's terrible, Mac. Thank you for asking. It might be worse than the first one. I mean, I cannot find a single flat spot in this entire restaurant. Maybe that's it. I'm just Goddamn it! This entire night is ruined. Dude, stop it! Okay? You're the one who's ruining this. I am enjoying myself. I'm enjoying our table. I'm trying to start the conversations. I wore two colognes. Oh, I'm very aware of how much cologne you're wearing, Mac. It's overwhelming me. I mean, every time the goddamn kitchen door opens, it wafts into my face. Hey, I like the way I smell. And I like me. And I haven't even gotten to talk about what I wanted to talk about, which is an issue that has been weighing on me, so I'm just gonna say it, okay? When I wanted to get the karaoke machine for our apartment, you laughed in my face. That's what this is about? Yes. The karaoke machine? Mac, you can't sing. It's not about singing! Okay? It's about you always putting me down, and you know what? I don't care; it doesn't matter. I'm out of here. Where you going? I'm gonna go sit with Frank and Charlie. Do not go to them. No, sit down, sit. Sit! Say something nice to me. What? I'm not going to sit down until you say something nice to me for once in your life. Your hair looks small. Oh, for Okay, okay, okay, man. All right, sit down, sit down. Sit. Please sit down. Okay, listen, listen. You remember that night at Dooley's pool party? On that fine summer eve, when I did that double jackknife twist and blew everybody's tits off? You remember that? And then I went down on Chrissie Orlando on the trampoline later that night? You're just complimenting yourself. No, listen, I'm going somewhere with this. The only reason I was even able to attempt that amazing feat of courage was because I knew if I failed, you would Everybody. Hello! All the patrons of Gugino's, listen up. Hi, everybody. Frank Reynolds, Charlie Kelly. We would like to make a toast. Now, in front of you, you each see, you have a glass of sambuca? You see this white, beautiful drink? Yeah. Okay, everyone got it? Yeah. Dude, everybody has sambuca but us. Now we have an American hero tonight, so quick round of applause for our troop here. Nice-looking fellow. And to anyone who does not have a glass of sambuca Look around now. You'll see them. Those people refuse to drink. Yeah. They don't know how to pay tribute. They hate America! They hate the troops. Mm. They hate the people who work hardest for them. They turn them into janitors. Mm, mm. It's not right. Aah! Damn 'em to hell. To the troops! To the troops. Cheers. To America! Good job, fellas. We did it. This is unbelievable, Mac. You know, and they totally ruined our heartfelt moment. Now, there's a way we can get it back-- if you just kind of jump No, you fool! That time has passed. Can't you see they're humiliating us? Just tell me what you were gonna tell me. I'm not gonna stand for this. I'm not. Just, Dennis Come on, man! Goddamn it! Ma'am? Uh-huh. Please return to your table? Oh, you know what? I'm gonna sit next to the hero. I used to date a troop. He was crazy for jean shorts. Attention, uh, attention, everyone, please. If I could have your attention momentarily. Thank you. We do have an American hero in the house tonight. A strong man, a brave man. He's the kind of man who knows exactly who he is. He doesn't hide under a toupee. He faces his challenges, instead of just retreating to the sewers nude to forage for rings and coins. Or to the toilets. Or to a life filled with rats. He's the kind of man who gives me the courage to do an amazing double jackknife twist, which I did. Most of you people wouldn't even attempt that. I did it. And to go down on Chrissy Orlando on the trampoline later, on the very same night, which I also did. And I licked her asshole a little bit. It was pretty good. It was all right. It wasn't great. But it was fine. And I knew that it was gonna be fine because this guy would be here to catch me if I faltered. Yeah. The world is a safer place when he's around.  Did you ever know That you're my hero? 'Cause you are the wind Beneath my wings.  Thank you. Thanks. Thank you. Wow, dude. I mean, that was so touching. Oh. That's an amazing thing you said about the troop. Now, can we get back to the karaoke machine? Because I I was talking about you. That was about me? Yes. He wasn't there when I went down on Chrissy Orlando. I did not get that at all. I'm sor Dennis, that's really sweet. Thank you. I'm sorry. What's happening? Is it freezing in here all of a sudden? Yeah, and it's freezing. Air is blowing directly on us. What? I mean, what is happening? Those goddamn sons of bitches. They turned up the A/C. Because they knew we were sitting right underneath a vent. And they're trying to freeze us out. I didn't have your back before, but now I'm gonna be the wind beneath your wings. I'm gonna smash this over their goddamn heads. Yes, Mac. Yes! Yes! I'm gonna blast 'em with this fire extinguisher. Okay, I'll toss hot soup in their faces. I'll pinch their dicks with this lobster. Let's do it. What are you people doing? Excuse me. Excuse me. What are you people doing? Son a bitch! Hey, his shoelaces are tied together. What? Oh, my God! Somebody tied his shoelaces together. His shoes are tied. Spaghetti-O, the waiter. I've wanted to see that all night long. Yes. Yes. Oh, my God, who do we have to thank for this? Who? Oops. Deandra did it? Oh! Dee did it! It was Dee. Dee. Have you been here this entire time? Yeah, the whole time. Oh, great job, Dee. Great job. Oh, Dee. Hey, clash. Salud, huh? Salud. Guys? Guys, I'm really hurt. Back at the table! I want to hear some jokes out of you tonight. You want to try this coat on? It's gotta look good on you, dude. Put that hat on.                       When I'm too blind to see And how you used the love I give you  CHARLIE: Dee, what are you doing? DEE: I'm eating cake. I can see that you're eating cake, but that's Frank's cake from, like, a month ago. I threw that in the trash! DENNIS: Oh, my God. Seriously? Yes! Dee, you're eating trash cake and smoking? I mean, you know what you look like? You look like Like a bird? Yeah. Yeah, of course you look like a bird. Yeah. You always look like a bird. But I was gonna say, uh, you look like a Like a, like a bird lady covered in bird shit eating cake? Dee, slow down, all right? Yeah. Let the man do this. Let me do my thing. You're jumping on my thing here. MAC: You know what she looks like? She looks like a bird that has no A bird with no tits and no ass? Dee, let us handle Yeah. FRANK: I got one, I got one. Go, go, go, go, go, go! She looks like Like a bird. That was it. Was that it? Ah That was it. See? That would have been funny, Dee. Right. Yeah, Dee, don't What are you doing? You know, that's not fun. Stop. Stop whatever this is. I don't like it. I'm sorry, you guys. I'm sorry. Don't apologize. That's just sad. Fight back at us. What's the point? The joke's always on me, all right? I get it. Yeah, but it's no fun unless you fight back. Yeah. Yeah, I'm just gonna go home. Good, go home. I hope you, uh You hope I get hit by a bus? Dee, come on, that's What difference does it make? I can't get any lower than I am already. I might as well just throw myself in front of a bus though, because I'm so ugly I can't even get a bus to hit on me. Well. Geez. What the hell was that all about? I'll tell you exactly what that was. (door opens) Dee? Dee, are you dead? Did you kill yourself, Dee, or? Ah. Dee, why is your door unlocked? Do you realize how unsafe that is? Mm-hmm. Okay, Dee, this is truly pathetic, and you are really bringing us down, so we're gonna help you out. We realize we may be in some ways responsible for the state you're in. Yeah, all right, so we got an idea though, okay? We're gonna sign you up for an open mic night at a comedy club! Yes. Right? That's your thing! And we're actually gonna support you, Dee. And now that you don't care anymore, you're not gonna gag on stage. Yeah, you know, you're right in that sweet spot between, like, suicidal and actually dead, where most comedians, they thrive there. Yeah, what was that thing you said about how the joke's always on you? That could be a catchphrase. Dee, look, I don't want to pile on here, 'cause you're clearly very close to killing yourself Yeah. but I got to say, I totally disagree with the guys on this. I'm glad you've given up. And I want to propose something totally different: I would like to find you a man. Come on. Yeah. A man to settle down with. Now, I'm not talking about a smart man, not-not a handsome man, but a very, very average if not below average man to take you off of our hands forever. Yeah, okay. Go ahead. Go with it. Go with it? Which one? You were not clear. The thing. Whatever. Both. I don't care. Let's-let's do my plan. The comedy plan. Let's do our plan. We're gonna do the comedy plan, all right? Meh. (breathing into microphone) (hushed): Dude, she is gonna bomb so hard, and then she's gonna feel worse. (hushed): It's okay, dude. She'll tell a couple jokes, and then we'll, like, fake laugh and stuff, you know? And tomorrow we can shit on her. And she'll fight back and be happy again. Say something! (listlessly): I decided to stop showering. (Frank laughs) Too much, Frank, too much. That's There was no joke told. I just figured, "What's the point? I'm just a filthy person." I passed out at the park the other day, and a couple of kids wrote, "Wash me" in the filth on my vagina. (laughter) Gross. That was kind of funny, man. That was kind of funny. It was so gross. It was gross. Yeah, but that guy over there laughed. I guess, joke's on me. (laughter) There's the catchphrase. Yeah, yeah! Ca Yeah, that's like a ca This is ridiculous. I'm gonna go select some men for Dee. This is a waste of time. Um, I stepped in front of a bus, but it missed me. I can't even get a bus to hit on me. (laughter) People are laughing! We love it! For real. For real? Yeah! Knock, knock, knock. Can we say hi? There she is! Comedy star. Dee so funny. Really funny. Oh, my God, so funny. Great! It was absolutely great! You did the bus joke, and it was like They loved the catchphrase. They loved the catchphrase! And think about this, Dee. You didn't even gag once. Not one dry heave, nothing. I guess I did pretty good. Yeah, great! "Pretty good," she said! Dee, it was one of those shows where you're, like, "Whoa!" Oh, my goodness. And then your brain goes (makes explosion sound). All right, guys, will you stop, okay? You're not helping. Please, go get a drink, all right? Give us a second. I need to talk to Dee. We tried. Yeah, you tried. That was it. Thanks, guys. All right, listen, listen to me. Your set tonight was terrible. It was atrocious. Every single thing that came out of your mouth was trash. It was filth. It was disgusting. That's what really happened, okay? I want to be very clear about this. Now, listen, I brought some men for you to look at, all right? I've got some selections. Now, they're not great. They're not, they're not anybody to brag about, but, uh, you know, they're men. And they're probably willing to spend their life with you, so Uh, hey, uh, sorry to interrupt. My name's Snyder, and I'm a talent scout. And I just caught your last set. You were hilarious. So I just wanted to give you my card. Give me a call. No, she will not be calling you, sir, okay? Please do not encourage her. Get out of here. You're-you're interrupting my work, all right? You're not on my list of chosen men. Why would you be? What are you? Christ. What are you doing? Why would you do that? Come on, Dee. That guy clearly just lurks around these places pretending to be a talent scout so he can hit on women. Now look-look at my selects, all right? Look at these guys, huh? (Dee gasps) Yeah, I know. This one's just, like, one big chin. Well, I didn't have a lot to work with. You know, here we are, and look at you. I mean, for Christ's sakes, look. Okay, I'm sorry. Look, I want this to work, I really do. So I know I can do better, all right? Can you do better, all right? I'm gonna be at your house tomorrow morning, 10:00 a.m. Have some new candidates for you to look at, all right? Okay. This is gonna work. This is not gonna work. Let's get you cleaned up, all right? God, everything you did tonight was so gross. Dee, open up! Open! You're locking your door all of sudden? What is that? Come on. You care all of a sudden? What? What? Hey, let me in. I got selections for you. Now's not a good time. I'm right in the middle of something. They're good selections. Hey, it's the time I said, so it's the time it'll be. Now let me in. I got selects. I don't care about your selects. Go! What are you doing? Are you hiding something? No. Is someone in there? No, no. Don't worry about it. Let me in or I'll barge in. Hey, everything all right over there, Dee? Yeah, it's fine. Oh, no. Dee, oh Oh! Snyder? Mm-hmm. He's clearly using you. Or you're using him to further your nonexistent career. I am not using him. Oh, you're not using him? Nope. Oh, good, good, good, good. So, you like him? Mm-hmm. Find him attractive? Absolutely. Describe the ways in which you find him attractive. (Dee scoffs) He's got he's got all of his skin, still. Well, I would hope so. And that he has plenty of teeth to get But not all of them? No, not all of them. Hmm. Dee, why can't you see that this is the same pattern that you always fall into? Some guy uses you or you use him. And then you know what happens? It's use, use, use, fail, fail, fail, and then it's suicide. You think you can't go any lower? Because you can. Oh, yeah? Well, he got me another gig for tonight, boner. What do you think of about that? (making goofy noises) What-what is that? What are you what are you doing? Sound effects. Oh, goddamn, Dee. You have no idea what's funny. Don't do sound effects. (Dee making goofy noises) Don't do don't wh-what Oh, oh, oh. Hey, hey, hey! Oh! Hey, Dennis, oh, check this place out. This is legit. Dude, dude, Dee's opening for Landslide. That guy's, like, the real deal. I've never heard of him. Mostly diarrhea jokes. Yeah, he's the diarrhea guy, but it look-looks like this comedy stuff's paying off for her. Yeah, well Hey, you don't get a gig like this by accident. Oh, come on, don't get too excited, all right? She got the gig 'cause she's banging some creep. It's not gonna go well. Who's the nerd? Who, this guy? This is Walt. Yeah, guy's got no self-esteem, just like Dee, so they're perfect for each other. So after she bombs tonight, I'll put them together, thereby controlling the situation, and her, as I always have and I always will. What? Uh Walt, just Walt-Walt's the plan. I'm Walt. Yeah, shut up, Walt. They know who you are. I'm sorry. Ladies and gentlemen, Sweet Dee Reynolds! (crowd cheering) Sweet Dee! (breathing into microphone) Sweet Dee, joke's on you! (laughter) She's got fans now? Christ, come on. So I finally broke down and I took a shower the other day. The stink flipped around and now my soap smells like dirty vag. (laughter) She said "vagina." A woman said "vagina." That's what makes it funny! Tasteless. (robot voice): Vagina, vagina. Vagina, vagina. (laughter) (making fart noises) And the sound effects out of absolutely nowhere, no setup. But it's funny! It's not funny, it's not funny. It's funny, Dennis. What are you doing? Will you stop laughing, Walt? Oh, my God, this is the worst. People will laugh at absolutely anything. This is comedy? (laughter) So, men are just so hard. Tell you what, they all walk out on me. Every one of them. I can't even keep crabs in this vagina. (laughter) They're all like, "Clickety clackety, clickety clackety, clickety clackety clack. I got to get out of here!" (robot voice): Evacuate vagina. "Clickety clackety, clickety" (making machine gun noises) The crabs have machine guns. That makes sense. All right, well, that's it for me tonight. I'd like to say it was fun, but I've had a better time ripping out my own pubes. Shellac, shellac, rip! (yelling wildly) Ping, ping, ping, ow! (laughter) Okay, you guys, well, I'm Sweet Dee, and the joke's on me! (crowd cheering) What is going on? This is unbelievable. Let's give it up for Landslide!

I bet his diarrhea is nasty! Nasty! Oh, butts, vaginas and diarrhea, great. This is what the world's come to. (Charlie laughing) Hey, hey. You're on the list? The list? I'm-I'm Sweet Dee's brother, so we're good. Can't let you back there unless you're on the list. We got to be on that list. This is fantastic. I'm not on a list for a place that I don't want to be. You know how that feels? Hey, Dee? Dee? Uh, don't play this game, Dee. I-I We're five feet away from you, I know you hear Deandra. Dee. Dee. Da. Da. Da. Dah. Dah. Dah. Dah. Dee. Dee.

Yeah, hey, we're, like, you're biggest fans, like, great show, like, good job, like, shut up, I'm sorry. We're gonna start a fan club. Oh, come on, stop kissing her ass. Dee, enough of this, okay? Step over the rope and come meet Walt. Tell you what. You three, you're in. Dennis, you're out. Go before she changes her mind, go. Hey! Faced! Thanks, Dee. Dee, who do you think you are? What is the matter with you, Dennis? You see them? They're supporting me, okay? Because they believe in me. A fan club could really help further my career. Career? Oh, wow, Dee. See, you don't have a career. All right? So I need you to stop all this right now. It's gone too far. Now, come meet Walt. He is my select. You know what I think this is about, Dennis? I think you're jealous. I don't think you want me to succeed. Dee, let me be very clear about something. You will never succeed. Ever. Instead, you will fly too close to the sun, and you will choke and you will gag in a spectacular manner. So, please, for the love of God, take Walt. Hi, I'm Walt. She knows your goddamn name, Walt; I said it, like, a thousand times. Look, you know what? I don't want to be with Walt, okay? And I don't want you to find me a man. What I need you to do is stay out of my way, because Sweet Dee is gonna be a star. (making machine gun noises) (laughter)   Oh. (crowd cheering) All right! Here, buddy, everyone else. (laughter) (making machine gun noises) Right, I'm Sweet Dee, and the joke's on me! Thank you very much. Good night. (crowd cheering wildly) I don't care that you only have one mic. Look at me!

I chartered a jet. We flew all over Philadelphia for six hours. And I'm a garbage man. He's a garbage man! He's your garbage man! You've met him. None of this is real, Dee! None of it! Hey, hey, some of it was real. Yeah! You banged that guy! (laughter) Hey, best part? Dennis wasn't even in on any of it! (laughs) I was and I wasn't. I was and I wasn't. He wasn't, he wasn't. No, no, no. No, we knew we had to drag him through the mud, make it seem legit. It was great, it was great. The joke's on him, too! Yeah, joke's on him! (noisemakers blare) Well, it was good. It was a good joke. It was a good joke. Good joke, guys, I love jokes. She's got more to say. Oh. She's got more to say. Why would you do this? Oh, well, you know, you were being all mopey and annoying Yeah. complaining and stuff. We wanted to show you that you could sink lower. Talking about killing yourself, ugh. Some things you just don't joke about, okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah. You took it too far. Right. Too far. Yeah. I took it too far? That's what I said. Oh I took I took it too far? Oh, God, you sons of bitches! (roaring) And there she goes! She's back! (laughter) I no! All right, so we got Dee back, and I think we may have broke Dennis. Broke me? Nah, come on, I'm good. (laughs) I love all this. This is great. I'm gonna pop out for a little while. (laughing) He's not loving it. He's not. He's not loving it. No, he's not. (yells) He might go kill himself. (noisemakers blare)                       Good morning, Philadelphia. With us today is Frank Reynolds, local business owner and a man with a harrowing story. That's right. A few days ago, three thugs tried to mug me. And I want to be very clear about something. Um, Mr These pieces of garbage, they don't know who the hell they're dealing with. Mr. Reynolds, excuse me. Do you think maybe you could eat that sandwich later? I'm starving. You don't have nothing to eat in this show. Let's get back to your story. Right, so these punks Yes. I don't know if they wanted money or they wanted something more sexual. Wow. But it's a lucky thing I had my pieces. Your-your pieces? My guns. Oh, my. Anyway, I started blasting. Bah! Bah! Now, I don't see so good, so I missed, then they ran away, I ran after them. Okay. Bang! Tried to shoot them in the back, but I don't run so good either. Anyway, you guys all think I'm a hero, and I'll accept that responsibility. Now, weren't you concerned though that an innocent bystander may have Look, crime in this city is out of control. Mm. Thank God I went down to Gunther's Guns and picked up a spare. I don't think one would've done it. I'm gonna go out and buy some more. Okay. And I think you should, too. Don't be a victim.
 It's time to fight back.
 This is crazy.
 Completely insane.
 Oh, it's driving
 me nuts.
 The whole gun thing, it just makes me really hot. Yeah, well, it's a hot issue and I'm getting hot about it, too. This is good, we're all hot at the same time. We should do something about I mean, our schools aren't safe. There are people out on the streets with assault rifles? We're living in constant fear! Aw, guys, we got to get more guns on the streets! Yeah! Wait, what? We got to get more guns onto the streets. Yeah, we got to get guns in the right hands. I mean, we're just not safe. That's what you guys are hot about? Yeah, didn't you hear what Frank said? Yeah, what are you hot about? There are too many guns on the streets as it is. Guns off the streets is what we need. It's way too easy for anybody to just walk into a store and get a gun. No, it's not. It getting harder and harder. The government's trying to take our guns away. It's way harder than you think, dude. Guys, we're hot about the complete opposite. Shoot. Which is a bummer, 'cause I thought we were on the same page for once. Still very hot though. Yeah. Oh, I'm even hotter if I'm being honest. Still hot. Good call on these outfits, dude. It's the only call. You know what I mean? Like, you need a guy in a school that even from a mile away, the school shooter sees that guy and says, "Uh-uh." "I ain't messing with that dude." "I'm not messing with that dude. I'm not going near that school." Uh, gentlemen, I understand that you would like to You How-how did you find me? Oh, shit, I know this dude. Who-Who's this? This guy was the principal at the high school where I was doing the janitor thing. Yeah. Right, so why are you at a middle school now? Well, I was I was transferred. See, I have tenure, so they couldn't actually fire me, which was, of course, their first choice, thanks to you. Well, let's not throw barbs at each other. Look, we're actually here for a good cause. We want to protect this school. Oh. Yeah, we want to be the armed security guards. Yeah, I brought a piece. We're good. Hey, hey, hey, no, no! Calm yourself. No, you got to put no It's not currently loaded. That's not the Just put it away. I hear you, buddy. I would not want to be around this guy with a gun either. He has got a hair trigger. I mean, one little move and he'll just start blasting. Uh, bullshit. Look, the point is he shouldn't have a gun in a school in the first place anyway. No. Guns just do not belong in schools. No, they do not. That is why I brought along a saber. Aw, Jesus Christ. Which is just about the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen in my life, because how are you gonna stop a gunman with that? Bro He's gonna get you from a distance. If I come at you, I'll get to you faster. We have been arguing about this all day. Because it's insanity. Ooh, maybe you can be the judge. I don't want What? Here we go. I'm gonna holster my weapon, he'll holster his weapon. No, we, no I'll do, like, a one, two, three count, you tell us who goes faster. Please don't do this in here. Look, dude, this is the only way to tell, okay? And then we can protect your school, but we got to go one step at a time, all right? I mean, for God's sake Whoa, whoa, whoa. Sorry, sorry. Look out! Ah. I guess I do have a hair trigger, huh? Yeah. All right. Look at all these maniacs. Goddamn bloodthirsty freaks walking in off the street. So easy for anybody to just waltz in and buy a gun. Let's do it. Let's buy assault rifles and just prove to Mac and Charlie how easy it is. Oh, we're gonna, we're gonna. That's what we'll do. Hi, how are you, sir? Howdy, I'm Gunther. What can I do for you? Oh, Gunther himself, purveyor of destruction. I would like to buy a man destroyer from you, please. Yeah, nice to meet you, Gunther. Hey, maybe you could recommend something that could blow a hole through an elephant, you know. 'Cause I need that for my home protection. Yeah. I guess you're looking at an AR-15. Oh, look at that. Yeah, that's great. Now, theoretically, Gunther, would I be able to slaughter a roomful of innocent people with that weapon? Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Brother, that'd be on you. That would be on me, wouldn't it? Yeah, that wouldn't be on you at all. But here you go. But here you go. But here you go. Okay, great, we'll take one of those, please. Yeah, we got it. How much would that be? Uh, that's $1,500. Woof! $1,500 for the privilege, okay. Hey, what is your, uh, what is your return policy there? All right. Ooh, 30 days, sounds fair. My goodness, Dennis, this feels good. Feels good in my hands. Oh, good my kids are safe. I saved everyone! Yeah, my yard's protected. So, of course, it feels good, you know? But that only proves our point even more. We'll take two of these, Gunther. Great. I'll need your licenses for the background checks. Okay, yeah. Yeah, you can drive, you can kill! Oh, Christ, look at this. Oh, God. Oh, shit, I love this guy. become a bit of a local lightning rod in these gun debates here. Exactly. Gun sales have skyrocketed. We're running out of guns, and we have to manufacture more guns; supply is not meeting the demand. Can we can we cut? Will my hands look this small on the screen? Uh, we're live, sir. I thought the camera would add ten pounds to my hands, and I don't like the way they look. Your hands look fine. Put them down. This is Jack Kelly. He's my attorney. He specializes in Constitutional Law. Our rights are being infringed upon. And people like my client won't take it anymore. The Constitution guarantees our Second Amendment rights. And these liberals like Al Gore, they're trying to take that away from us with this global warming bullshit. So, you see the two issues as related somehow? Damn right. The government of today has no right telling us how to live our lives, because the government of 200 years ago already did. Yeah. Oh, okay. They also protected us from tyranny against the seizure of tasteful, artistic photographs of beautiful bodies. Not now, Jack. That same government wants to come into our home, tell us what is and what is not art? That's not right! Okay, well, I'm gonna try and, uh, keep things on track here, so Yeah. Get out and get those guns before they run out, and the government changes the laws. All right! Yeah! These idiots are buying this? It's crazy. What is going on? That was fast. You've been denied. What? That's ludicrous. Why? It says here you have an extensive history of felonious behavior. Oh, there have been incidents, sure, yeah, a few minor indiscretions, but, you know, I-I'm simply a person of interest in most of those cases, all right? Being wanted and being "wanted for questioning" are very, very, very different things, Gunther. And you've been institutionalized. Me? She she yeah. What I mean, one time, for a short period of time. That-that was against my will. That doesn't even really count. That's the only time it counts, Dee. Okay, look, it was, like, a teeny thing that happened with a college roommate. It was really no big deal. Uh, yeah. Says here you burned her. I burned her, yeah. I burned her. But She was so annoying. I mean, it She deserved it, okay? She was wearing my stuff, and she was copying me, and You were copying her. I was copying her, she was copying me It doesn't matter. Look, I'm sorry, but I can't sell you the guns. Oh, God. Oh, well, look at you. Oh, Gunther the morality king. "Hi, I'm Gunther, I've never lit anybody on fire before." You know, you light one bitch on fire, and everybody freaks out! Oh, you son of a bitch. It was one time and one thing, I just All right, all right, all right, relax, relax. Okay, take it easy. Look, there are other ways to buy guns where people don't go snooping around in your past. Listen, pal you just made my list. Your list? Yeah, I have a Shh. Whatever, let's just go. Let's go. How is that tasteless? It's art. Get that out. Get that out. You can't even see the child We'll be right back. Weather, traffic and a trip to the zoo, coming right up. Okay, Charlie, I'm gonna demonstrate to you how to thwart an attack. Mm-hmm. Now, pretend that this dummy is a school shooter. Right. I want you to stand back, 'cause I don't want you to get hurt. Before he can draw his weapon Hie-aught! Hup, hut, hut! Hie! How awesome was that? Well, yeah, that's-that's pretty awesome, but I feel like he would've shot you from a mile away. No, no, he wouldn't, because you saw how I was zigzagging like this and making sounds? It was distracting. Yeah, but did you ever see Indiana Jones, where the guy does the whole sword thing and then he just shoots him dead? Are you asking me if I've seen Indiana Jones? Are you seriously asking me? I've seen that movie That is my You're not understanding. Do you remember it? Yes. But if I were to come at you, it's all about how I Okay, in that circumstance, maybe you got there a little bit faster. I got you. But if I! Okay. I got you again. But I What if I zigzag like this? It's so easy to get you. And that's that's not necessarily I don't think that that's Hold-hold on a second. Look at this kid. Ooh, he's wearing all black, he's walking by himself. What do you think he's doing on that phone? Oh, I'll tell you exactly what he's doing. He's playing one of those games where you shoot everyone. I'm gonna profile this guy really quick. Excuse us. Yeah. Hey, kid, kid, kid. Stop, stop. Son, son, I'm sorry, hold up, hold up. What are you doing on the phone there? None of your business. A sass-mouth, huh? That's a red flag. Son, you were asked a question by an adult, okay? You've been asked a question, all right? We're trying to ensafen your school here, okay? And you're acting like a punk? Let me see the phone. I want to see. Oh! He's killing zombies! I'm taking this. What the hell, man? Hey, kid, you're getting off easy! Now get to school. Go to school. Just know we're watching you. Go to class. Be careful. Look. This is a red flag. These are the kids that are the threats to society, the ones playing the violent video games, man. I play violent video games. Well, yeah, I also play violent video games. I watch violent movies. Well, yeah, violent movies are the best movies. And I don't want to kill people. No, I mean All right, this Yeah, it's not really the best way to tell, you know, who's gonna be a threat or who's not gonna What is going on out here? Nothing, thanks to us, bro. Well, are-are you stealing kids' cell phones? Stealing, sir? No. I've been confiscating them as potential evidence. Are you aware that you're holding children up with a gun and-and a sword? You just you need to stay off of school property. Sir, we are not on the school property, okay? Yeah, we're outside of the fence by, like We're on the sidewalk, see? You need to stay 1,000 yards away from school property. I mean, we're trying to keep the school safe! I know, well, yeah. Well, yeah, we would all feel a lot safer if you were further away. All right, I'm taking this guy out. Hey, whoa, settle! Settle, settle, settle! Settle. Settle down. Would you please stop pointing that gun at me? The school is safe, thanks to us. Here's the damn phone. Well please, just if you could just get away from the school. Get away from the children. Hey! Just-just stay away from the children. Have a good day, sir. Thank you. Have a good day. Go. We're leaving! We're leaving, we're leaving. We're leaving. You know, Charlie, if we can't be in the school zone, maybe we need to train somebody who can be. You know, someone you'd never suspect could stop a shooter. I got an idea. And here we are, Dee, at a gun show, huh? Lowest common denominator. Is that a bazooka? Insanely dangerous, this place is. It's crazy. Oh, look at this guy right here. He'll probably sell us a gun. Excuse me, sir. Um, I would like to buy a gun from you. Something that is unnecessarily powerful, something you would never need in Philadelphia. Yeah, ooh, ooh, but you know what you shouldn't do though, is look into our very sketchy pasts. No. Uh, it's not a problem. We all got a sketchy past. Oh, genuine creep. Wonderful. Perfect. Hey, sir, could you please sell us this AR-15? Yeah. Uh, despite, you know, who or what we plan to obliterate with it. And don't ask questions, okay? No. 'Cause we just want to prove to our friends how easy it is to buy a high-capacity rifle. Absolutely. All right, man, great. Hey, so give this guy his 1,500 bucks, and we'll just saunter right out of here with a weapon of mass extinction. Three grand. What? I'm sorry. That's $3,000. No, not for this. No, for this, for this. No, no. No, no, no, no, no. At Gunther's it's $1,500. Oh, this ain't Gunther's. This a price gouge? Oh, my. That's illegal. Oh, you see, I'm a private seller. That means I can do whatever I want. Shit. Fine. That's fine. We'll buy it, and we'll return it. All sales are final. Come on! I'll show you what's final, you redneck son of a bitch! I will burn you alive like the last bitch who crossed me! Okay, all right, all right, Dee. That's not getting us anywhere. Okay, she's hot. I went I went hot real fast; it just happened. Well, our whole crew's been hot lately. We're trying to cool down, but you're not making it any easier. Mm-mm. All right, listen, I want this gun, pal. Okay, I want it, because it's easy to buy a gun. And I need to prove that to some people, so give me the gun at a fair price, and do it now. $4,000. Shit! Four thou? $4,000? Really? I'll tell you what. How about I just take it, huh? 'Cause I'm a maniac with a gun, and there's nothing you can do about it. Oh. Oh, oh. Okay. Oh, okay. Oops. Putting the gun down now. Okay, this is just a just an exercise, okay, to prove how unsafe it is for everyone to have guns, okay? But I see now that I was the maniac with the gun. And you all made it safer in here. Yeah. Good for you. Our bad, our bad for this experiment. Thank you for joining us. I know you may not see yourself as a solution to a national problem. You might not think you have the ability, but, uh, believe me, you were you were carefully selected. And with a little hard work and a whole lot of training, we can help you keep your school safe. Are there any questions? Yo, can I get some beer? No beer. No. We said it, like, a million times. Guys, guys, how many times do we have to be through this? No beer, okay? All right, you know, you can't drink beer and be effective. But you guys had, like, five. Don't count beers, Carlos. Not cool. Yeah. And by the way, Carlos, I've had six. And I've had seven. So don't be a rat, okay? And if you are gonna be a rat, get it right. No more questions. In fact, no more questions. You guys are the ones that asked for the questions. Shut up, Carlos! Carlos, shut up! The time for questions is over. It's now time for learning. Okay? You're-you're impeding on your own safety. Okay, now my friend and I have been arguing all day about the efficacy of swords versus guns. Okay? So we met in the middle. Now if you look under your seat, you'll see that each of you has been provided a weapon that you could easily find in your own classroom. Some of you may have compasses, others, sharp pencils. Okay, there are forks in the cafeteria, there's piano wire from the music room. You need to learn how to make every single item in your school a potentially life-threatening weapon. Look at the person sitting next to you. That person wants to take you out. Guys, safety is the name of the game. It's all about safety. Let's take it slow. We're gonna take this in a safe and orderly fashion. Are you ready to begin? Okay. And, guys, let's have a little fun. Shut it, shut it, shut it! Those-those kids are maniacs! Oh, my God, I think they're all in gangs or something! There's a lot of score settling going on in there! Oh, yeah, dude, we created a HungerGames-type scenario in there. Imagine if they had guns! Oh, it'd be a disaster! An absolute disaster! These kids are all too violent. It's, like, ingrained in them or something. Oh, my God, dude, we've been singing the wrong tune. Society is getting more savage. We need to get the weapons out of their hands! Maybe we should call the cops, the only people who should have guns! They got to come in here, they got to calm this down! Oh! Oh, shit, Charlie, I got to admit something, dude. I'm bleeding pretty bad. One of the kids got you? I nicked myself back in the principal's office just trying to upholster my weapon. Jesus, man. I didn't want to say anything 'cause it was a little bit embarrassing. All right, can I go to the hospital? Yeah, let's go.
 Go, go, go, go, go.
 First they disarm us, then they oppress us. So I want you to get every gun you can buy and bring it to 17th and JFK, and we're gonna march on City Hall. And bring whatever guests you want, regardless of age or whatever restriction the government puts on our expression of beauty. Just get the guns and bring them down to City Hall. Well, you better believe I'll be there. I know you'll be there. Bring your kid. You have kids? Yes, of course, of course. Bring them. I mean, come on. He's really going off the deep end, Dee. I don't know. I hate to admit it, Dennis, but he's got a point, you know. It doesn't seem like it's all that easy to buy an assault rifle. No, no, no, no, no. Don't you start with that shit, Dee. Well, I'm sorry. It is incredibly easy to buy assault rifle, and I'm gonna prove to you how easy it is right now. Okay, here comes our guy. Mm, mm. No. Hi.
 Uh, you got my money?
  You got my people-killer? Right here. Oh, ho, ho, ho. That's the stuff, baby. Now, I got $1,500, which is the fair asking price. I hope that's okay. Yeah. Give it to me. All right. There you go. All right, now, I'm not really totally comfortable rolling the window down. I'm sure you understand why, so I'm just gonna pop the trunk and you can, uh, you can throw it in there, all right? Back there? Yeah. In the trunk? Yeah. Okay, I got you. You see how easy that is, Dee? You just give a man $1,500 and he gives you an assault rifle. Uh-oh. Ooh, ooh. Ooh, ooh. What? Where's he going? Well, he appears to be sauntering off. Well, don't do No. Well, sir, I gave you the $1,500. Don't saunter away. I'm try That's not fair! No, it's not fair! You stop right now! Listen, you stop in your tracks! Uh, Dennis, go stop him. Denni Go stop? The man has an assault rifle! What am I supposed to do?! Shit! I can't buy one! The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun, which we can't get! Goddamn son of a bitch Frank, you were right! Frank was right! Shit! Where's Frank? We're hot. We're coming in super hot! Where is Frank?! Oh, you guys hot? You guys are still hot? The whole thing's hot, man! Oh, yeah, I'm burning up right now! It's a crazy situation! We're on your side now! We got to get these guns off the streets! Boo-yah! Wait, what? No, no. Off the streets? What are you, crazy? We need the guns on the streets! Everyone needs to have guns! We need to flood the streets with guns! To stay safe. Aw, shit. I mean, I think, uh You know, I think we crossed right past each other like ships in the night, man. We flip-flopped. Yeah, 'cause we're on the opposite side now. That side makes no more sense to me. If we could've just met up, like, two hours ago Oh, oh, there's Frank. Hey, Frank! Frank, is that a box of guns? What is that? Guns? No. Water filters. Water filters? All right, guys, load 'em in. Very nice. Hey, Frank, why do you have a truck full of water filters? Uh, you know what, I don't give a shit. Let's get down to that rally, man. Rally? Yeah. Yes, the freedom rally. The one you organized. Ooh, shit, I'm not gonna go down there. It's gonna be a bunch of nuts with guns. Too dangerous. Wait, hold on a second. What's going on? I thought you were into guns. You know, why have you been on TV talking about all that shit? I bought a stake in Gunther's Guns. I got everybody angry and scared. They bought the guns, I made a fortune. Oh, my God. This is crazy. So you don't give a shit about the gun issue at all? Uh, uh I mean, what the hell? You're like the NRA. Yeah, a little bit like the NRA. Little tiny bit. But I-I think of myself more like Al Gore. You know, he got everybody worked up over global warming. Then he made millions. Huh?! Yeah. Everybody does it. Liberals, conservatives, doesn't matter. This is America: you're either a duper or a dupee. I'm a duper. You guys are the dupees. I got to go. Where you going now? With us now is local community activist, Frank Reynolds, with a terrifying statistic. Frank? Yes. Thank you, Chet. You're welcome. Do you know that 90% of your water is 100% toxins? Who knows what the other 10% is? It's probably far worse, I would imagine. It's really worse. I have a water filter for you that you need to put in every single home. It will protect you and your entire family. You can even give that water to your babies. Wow. Well, babies, look out, because this next segment is just for you. Don't turn that channel. Your life may depend upon it. Got to give it to him. He is good. That son of a bitch. Goddamn. Yeah. I think I'm gonna get one of those water filters. I do kind of want one, right? For safety, for safety. I mean, he does make some good points. Yeah. The water's toxic. I mean, it is. Yeah.                     
 Just use 'em, dude.
 I'm not going to wear gloves while I work! I'm sorry, it makes no sense. It absolutely makes sense-- you're a janitor who snakes toilets with his bare hands. So my hands get a little dirty from time to time. I appreciate the concern, but I'm fine. It's not for you! It's for us! Use gloves! Use gloves. Oh, look at this. Check it out. The Restaurant and Bar Association's Best Bar Award is coming up. We could get nominated. Frank, we never get nominated for awards, okay? And we don't give a shit because they're stupid. Yeah, we don't care about that kind of stuff, all right? Look, am I curious as to why we never get nominated? Sure, yeah. Do I care? Not in the slightest. No, I don't care about it, you know? I mean, all right, it is a little odd we've never been nominated. Yes, it's odd. At some point it becomes a little aggressive. So what is it? We don't deserve it? We're not cool enough? Whoa. Whoa, okay, Frank. Now, if if I do something, you better believe it's cool. Yeah, if I'm gonna put my name on something, it's gonna be award-worthy, you know. I can't imagine that other people are doing what we're doing better. I mean, it's serving up drinks. It's just upsetting. I'm sorry, I'm getting upset. If-if you want to get a nomination, you got to play the game. Nah, I don't want to play a game to get an award. That feels lame.
 It is lame.
 Oh, is that your ass? Oh, closer to the hole, sir? You know what's lame? Being around this long and never getting an award. Makes you look like a bunch of assholes. Hmm. You're really, like, driving this home, and it's upsetting, because, like, now I'm getting the neck thing. I feel I feel I'm getting upset. Yeah, your neck's going nuts? Yeah! You're getting that? They're making me feel like an asshole. They are making us feel like assholes. All right, you know what, we'll play the game, I'll kiss ass. Yeah, let's play the game. I'm okay with it, because who cares? All right, fine, let's play the game. But I want to be very clear about something. This literally means nothing to me. This office sucks. It smells bad and it's stuffy in here. Yeah, it's the Restaurant and Bar Association, it's a stuffy organization. They're not in touch with the young people like us. Some old boner gives me attitude, I'm gonna spit in his face. He starts giving me shit, I'll spit at him. We should all spit. Look, we're not spitting, all right? Just keep your mouth shut and let me do the talking. I know what I'm doing. Sorry, sorry to keep you waiting. Frank Reynolds, Paddy's Pub. These are my associates. Stand up, show him some respect. I stand for no one. Please, it's not necessary. Have a seat. You heard the man-- sit down. Well, now I feel like standing. But I don't want to stand through an entire meeting 'cause I don't know how long it's gonna last, so I'll sit down. It's my choice. With much dignity and grace, we've come to talk to you about the Best Bar Award. Now, in the past, our group has not paid you any attention, but now we are prepared to pay you what you deserve in attention, if you get my drift. I don't. Ponder lettuce and shrimp. Excuse me? He's inviting you out to lunch, Bozo-- you gonna go or not, yes or no? Actually, it's 3:30 in the afternoon-- I've already eaten. This dickhead doesn't want a second lun He's being offered lettuce and shrimp, he doesn't want to eat lunch. You eat once a day? Hey, everybody, I had food. All right, you know what, I am out of here. I don't need this limpdick telling me whether my bar's cool, okay? No, no, no! No spitting. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Look, how much is it gonna cost us to get on the ballot? Ten dollars. Huh? The entry fee is ten dollars. All you have to do is fill out the-the paperwork. Why have we never received this form? Well, we've-we've actually s-sent you the form many times in the past, and as I recall, it always comes back covered in fecal matter, urine, and racial slurs. Oh. That's a joke. Hey, you know, that's just, like, all in good fun, man. That's just our sense of humor-- you'll get us. Shut up! Let bygones be bygones. Right, right. We're here now to play the game. Yes. Playing the game. I assume you take cash. Oh! So sorry. That wasn't meant for you, that was actually meant for you. Yeah, that was meant for him. We thought maybe you would think that was funny. Yeah, if it exploded in your face, but I can tell by the look on your face that you don't think that's funny. That's not your style. That's a shame. Yeah, that's sort of our sense of humor. Guys, he's not gonna get us. I think we got to get out of here, right? All right, guy. What'd I say, idiots? You want to get nominated, you gotta play the game. We are playing the game, Frank. Nah, you're not playing We're just not vibing with that guy, he's a stiff. We were vibrating, but maybe at a different frequency than that guy. I like that. Frank is right. No, Frank is right, though. We're too fringe. I mean, yeah, it's given us a lot of street cred, but I think we've alienated a lot of people in this town. Yeah, you-you want to win awards, you gotta campaign for it. It's an industry award. It's true. Like, we know we're cool and our customers know we're cool, but the industry doesn't get it yet. All right, you know what? Can you guys actually drop me off back at the bar? I'm gonna go work on the Best Song. What Best Song? The Best Song Award. There is no Best Song Award. What are you talking about? Well, that's all the more reason to do a Best Song, right? We'll be the only bar who did it, and that's a good chance we'll cover all the bases. I tell you what: let's drop him off either way. Okay. That sounds good. Good idea, Charlie. Good idea, come on. What? I can't believe that this place won Best Bar. I mean, who comes to this place? A shitload of people. Sudz is a super-popular place. I can't believe how bright it is in here. I don't like it. Yeah. And what's with all the loud, fake colors? I mean, where's the subtlety? All right, let's go grab a drink. We'll suss out the competition. I'm gonna go find a manager, introduce myself, give him this swag bag. What's in that bag? Ah, it's just this stuff I had our names printed on. I got a bottle opener, a keychain, egg. Why would you give him an egg? It's like a paperweight. Trust me, Deandra, people eat this shit up. Look, you gotta play the game. I know how to do it. Right. Good luck. Let's get a drink. Yep. Hey, guys. How you doing? My name is Greg; I'll be your bartender tonight. You ever been to Sudz before? You wish. Don't think so, pal. Okay, well, welcome, then. For our first-timers, I like to recommend our blended signature cocktail, The Blue Hole. It's served with three straws in a fishbowl. It's pretty darn good. Some people say it's better than an orgasm. Not that he's ever had one. Oh! Okay, Maxwell, remind me to find a new best friend. Aw! Ee-aw! Ugh. Two margaritas for table six, Greg. Hey, Amanda, what's wrong? Let me guess. Your boyfriend canceled on you again. Conference got extended. What can I say? He loves his work. Well, I think he should spend a little less time on his work and a little more time on you. Aw Thanks. You're so sweet. Hmm. What in the hell is happening? I don't know. What are they doing? Okay, sorry about that. So, one Blue Hole? Uh, well, let's see. There's three of us, so, three drinks. Yeah, well, they're generally shared, 'cause they're pretty big. Said three, dick bag. Get three! Uh-huh. I don't care for that guy. Me neither. No. Too soft. I want a little edge in my bartender. You know, this is Philadelphia. What's with the, uh? What's with the black friend that no one is acknowledging? Is black? I feel like it's weird if you don't talk about that, you know? It's strange to have one black friend and not be constantly talking about it. Yeah, shine a light on it, make sure everybody sees and knows, like, "I have a black friend," and that's a thing. 'Cause it's weird that a black person is friends with white people. Hmm. I don't think it is. It's not that weird, but it's that but it's a thing. It is, it is. Here you guys go. Oh. There we go. Oh, drink up! What the hell was that? That's a Sudz alert. When we ring that bell, everybody's got to drink, right? Yeah. I don't need a bell telling me when to drink. I'll drink when I'm goddamn good and thirsty. I'm pretty sure I know when to take a drink. Screw their stupid bell, you know? I wish I had drank when everybody else drank, though, 'cause it seemed like fun. Well, now I feel left out. Can we drink now? Let's drink now. Together? 'Cause I-I Now I'm angry. Mmm. Mmm. What are you doing in my office? Oh. You snuck up on me. Frank Reynolds, owner of Paddy's Pub. I just thought I'd come by and say hello, pay my respects. Also, I got you a little goody bag here. Some trinkets, knickknacks that you might enjoy. There's a broken egg in here. Oh, shit. That wasn't the hardboiled one. Hey, you want me to cook that up for you? Ah. Mmm. Oh, man. Ooh! Goddamn. That went down easy. I like this. Yeah. Guys, I'm starting to like this place. It's growing on me, too. I-I like the chemistry that the staff has. Oh, did you guys see that charged moment between Greg and Amanda? Yes. Boy, I tell you. She's got a boyfriend, but I think that she and Greg should end up together. Ooh, ooh, ooh. I'd like to come back next week to see if they do. Yeah. Me, too. You know? I mean, she is cute, she is just super cute, right? She's so cute. She's cute. She is very cute. She's not funny, though, so Yeah, but, no, but she doesn't need to be funny because she's cute, she's loveable, everybody likes her, and then, if she can tell a joke, yeah, hey, it's just a bonus, you know? Let's get out of this dump. Oh, actually, this place is not a dump, Frank. It's pretty great. Hey, hey, Greg, can you get this man a Blue Hole? You got to try this thing. I got news for you. Our secret's out, and it stinks. This manager's been to Paddy's, and he said it's nothing but a bunch of people yelling over each other. Well So what? That's what we do. We yell at each other, and if people want to tune in and listen, then they're welcome to. Yeah, but I think that's off-putting to the customer. I mean, Greg would never yell at Amanda. All right, I'll tell you what we got to do. We got to up our game. We should host an industry night. Invite all the people who vote who's in the industry to come to our bar, and we'll show 'em what we're made of. Yeah, but I'd like to tweak a little bit of who we are and what we're made of, right? Yeah. Soften the edges a little bit. All right, we'll tweak it a little bit, we'll show these bastards who's award-worthy. Yeah. Yeah! Oh-ho! Drink! Drink! Okay, guys, if we're gonna show these industry folks tonight that we're likeable, we need to have some funny banter like Greg and Maxwell have. Yeah. Don't worry. I'm gonna be zinging one-liners all night long. Uh, actually, Dee, you won't be zinging anything around, because men are intimidated by funny women, all right? So, what we need you to be is just pretty and benign. But we are gonna do a will-they- or-won't-they thing between you and Mac. Dee and I don't want to be together. No. But the customers want you to be together. That's fun for them. Why would it be fun for them to watch two people not want to be together? Well, no. You do want to be together, okay? The customers have to think that you think that you don't want to be together, but you do, deep down, want to be together. The problem is, right now, I'm getting that you guys don't want to be together. I need you to want to be together. Ugh. Question. Yes, you're wondering how we're gonna make Dee attractive enough to where you'll want to be with her. Yes. Okay, see, what I'm gonna do is, I'm gonna shellac her with makeup, and I'm gonna blast her with light to soften up all those features. I am into that, yes. Yes. Okay, great. So, guys, I got us banter cards. Mac, you're gonna welcome the customer in, and then I'm gonna execute with a quip. Let's give it a shot. "Hey, I'm Mac. Welcome to Paddy's Pub. I would like to recommend to first-timers our signature blended drink, Caribbean Paradise. People say it's better than an orgasm." Not that he's ever had one. I've had orgasms! I've had tons of orgasms! I've had one with your mom, dude! I will strangle you, I'll stick my goddamn thumb through your eye! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, dude, relax, relax. Sit down. What are you doing? Okay. You came at me, and I gave it back to you hard, 'cause Uh, yeah, I'm getting that. Look, I'm just doing the thing. Oh. See, what you just did-- that's how we normally talk. That's very aggressive. I came at you hard. You came at me real hard, and people aren't comfortable with that sort of behavior. That's why we're trying something different here, okay? Guys, memorize these lines, okay? We need to seem like it's coming off the cuff. Right. Plus, she didn't even feel a thing. What? What? That's the punch line to Mac bang-banging our mom. She didn't, she didn't even notice. Oh, Dee, Jesus Christ, your timing is so bad. He just said it. There's a timing concern. Look, stop. Don't do the jokes, okay? Let's settle into our new roles here, okay? Little bit of role-play. Change of plans. Change of plans. We got to go darker with Industry Night, edgier. No, Frank, don't derail us. We're doing bright lights, bright colors, and funny banter. That's what wins. Wrong. Artemis and I went to a burlesque bar last night. Eh, there were women stripping, but it was classy. It was dimly lit. They were serving martinis, period costumes. There weren't a lot of people in there, but this bar has won a shitload of awards. Do you guys think that our location is the problem? Hmm. That could be it, yeah. Well, no, see, there was that bar that just opened last year right down the street, and they've already won a ton of awards. Oh, mm-hmm. Oh, right. Is it us? Ugh. No way. Us? No, no, no, it can't be us. No way. I highly doubt it's us. It's everybody else. It's their problem, not us. We don't have the Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey! I got it! I got it! Got what? The Best Song. I wrote the Best Song. It's amazing. Get with the program. Yes, Charlie, please. We're all clamoring to hear.  Whoa, they say The world's your oyster Ma'am, but oysters ain't for me  You're the belle of the ball But you ain't my cup of tea They always vote you  Best in Show But this doggie disagrees 'Cause I like life In Paddy's Pub  Okay.  There's a place for me It's the place I go Where the beer is cheap  And the lights are low It's Paddy's Pub I like Paddy's Pub  Let the record show The greatest place to go Is that bar called Paddy's Pub   I like life in Paddy's Pub  My goodness! Hey, hey! Well, well, well. My goodness. You guys really like it? You're not just bullshitting me? It was pretty great! I tried to go right down the middle, you know, of Middle America, Randy Newman Yeah, I didn't catch any rape references, nothing about spiders, nothing about ghouls. Why would there be rape? You're always talking about rape and spiders. You guys misinterpret it, but Charlie, that was great. It was really great. You really knocked it out of the park. Let's go down to the basement and get some lemons for the party. Oh, yeah, sure, okay. I'm glad you like the song, man. Are you locking me in here?! Yeah. Well, we just couldn't have him do that song. Doesn't make any sense. No. It's ridiculous. All right, let's put on a good show. All right, people are starting to arrive. This is great. Okay, so when a customer comes up to you, remember, keep it light. Light. Keep it playful. Playful. Right? Y'all ain't got to worry about me. 'Cause I'm gonna be chatting these fools up like a mug. Cool. Okay, thanks, Z. Yeah, I'm a little worried about him. We should have gotten a less intense black guy for diversity, but we don't have any in our roster. But maybe we could find another one, throw him into the mix? You know, to counter Z's vibe? You got to be really careful about the ratio. We get too many black guys, people think it's a black bar. That will not help us. Black bars don't win awards. No. I don't know why, but they don't. Loving these lights, you guys. I am glowing like an angel over here. Oh, my God. Hi, can I get a drink? Hey, I'm Mac. Welcome to Paddy's Pub. I like to recommend to our first timers our signature cocktail-- Caribbean Paradise. Some people say it's better than busting a nut. Excuse me? Busting a nut. It's like, uh, you know, blowing your load. He said it was a funny joke. Well, no hold on. Yeah, it's like coming all over you. It's light, it's playful. Yeah, well, no, I think what my friend is trying to refer to is an orgasm, which is light and playful, but he overstepped himself and got a little bit too specific. Sorry, we jizz in the drink and that's what makes it light. No, no, nobody's jizzing on anything. Well, where do I jizz? You don't jizz. How can, how can I orgasm if I don't jizz? No, ma'am, I think what Just tell me where I jizz so I can give this lady her drink. Ma'am, what would you like to drink? And we won't jizz on anything. Not like Mac's ever had an orgasm. Holy shit, you're late. She was late. Go back in your light. We're all set up back there. Deandra, grab a couple of bottles of champagne, let's go. Yup. N-N-No, I got it, I got it. Dee, stay in your light. Come with me, come here. All right, listen, listen, listen. What was that? All right, look, look, look, look. You two do the charged moment. Will they or won't they? Mm-hmm. What's wrong, Dee? Oh, nothing. Let me guess-- boyfriend troubles? Hmm. This guy doesn't know what he's got. He's really ugly, too. I'm sorry, are you talking to me? Yeah. I said her boyfriend's ugly. Pay attention, bozo. Okay, he's not ugly, all right? That wouldn't make any sense. That's-that He's not ugly. Dude's a total tool, too. It's You know what he's not? He's not covered in stupid tattoos and he doesn't have a cigarette for a mother What?! Don't talk shit about my mom! Whoa. Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Stop-- what the hell's going on over here? That man is choking that woman. Get over here. What are, what are you doing? This isn't will they or won't they? This is I know they won't and I know I don't want them to. Excuse me, there's a guy crawling out of your floor. Oh, uh, that-that's okay. That's just our janitor. Uh, don't worry about it, gentlemen. What are you doing, dude? I broke out. Are you high? You put, you put me in the basement with spray cans. I got high. Do me a favor, go back in the basement, okay? Get higher if you want. Just go back in. Don't sit down there. No, no, no, no, no, don't, don't Goddamn it. What are we gonna do? Oh, well, it looks like Z brought friends. Yo, yo, yo. What up? Oh! That's too many black guys, dude-- the ratio's off. Dennis, the ratio is off! Okay, you know what? Ooh, ooh, ooh, the burlesque, remember? Burlesque, yes, yes, yes. Hey, guys, guy gentlemen, gentlemen. How about something a little bit more upscale, yeah? Here, come with me. I want to show you something. Yeah, this is classy. Put it in. Put the bottle in. Oh, my God. I did. Put it in. Get the bottle out, get the bottle out! I'm trying! Don't judge me-- this is art. Shut the door. This is not art. Attention, attention, everybody. I got a little ditty about Paddy's Pub.

'Cause I like us. I like us, too, Dee. Well, because we're awesome. Yeah, we're good at what we do. Yeah! We do our own thing and we're good at it. I don't need their validation. That's exactly right. No, no, I'm happy with us. Totally. I really wanted an award, though. I was dying for one. Ah, it'd be so nice. Would've meant a lot. Yeah. Yeah.

I'm a little confused as well. Uh, I don't have a firm grasp on exactly how this It's confusing stuff. Where the hell is Frank? Where the hell is Frank? He can help us. He's, like, a business genius. I don't know where he is. He didn't come home this morning. He took off last night. He said he had some dream or something. And, like, he woke up, he's like, "Ah, Charlie, I got to get to the playground." And he shot out of here. Why is he at the playground? I don't know. He told me not to come. Well, we got to go figure it out. He can help explain all this. Yeah, he's good with stuff like this. We're not. All right, all right, let's do it. I'm drinking this one though. Yeah, but don't open any more. Frank? Huh? What is this? You're stuck? Was this your plan? No. What is this? How did this happen? How does anything happen, Charlie? Move past it, will ya? I'm afraid that's going to be impossible. Yeah. Where are your clothes? Why are you naked and stuck in a coil? Just get me out of here. All right, well, first we should do the thing because.. Yeah. Charlie and I have a couple of business questions we wanted to ask you first. What? Deandra, don't dick around. Get me out of here! Look, I'll be quick, okay? Now, Charlie and I have recently come into a rare business opportunity, and we were hoping you could clear a couple things up for us. Can you look at that? It's a pyramid scheme. It's not a pyramid scheme. It's a reverse funnel system. Turn it upside down. Oh, shit! Goddamn it! Shit! All right, you've been duped, suckers. You're the sucker, okay? You're naked and you're stuck in a coil! All right, calm down, calm down. Look, Frank is there any way, you know, to get out of one of these schemes? All right, what you got to do is round up a couple of suckers and get 'em hooked. Dummies with deep pockets are the best. What about Ben the Soldier? Well, he's as dumb as you can get. Yeah. He's dumb as bricks, that guy. He's so stupid. All right, let's do it. That's good. We'll get him, and I'll get, like, a pulley or a rope, and we'll just yank you out of there or something, all right? Get me out of here. Yeah. Hold on, hold on. Charlie, whoa, think about this. If we get him out of there, how do we know he's gonna keep helping us? Well, what do you mean? If we get him out of there, he might scam us further. We don't know. He's a business mastermind. I don't know what he's got going on. Shit, that's a good point. I mean, what's he doing in that coil, you know what I mean? He wouldn't say. He could be up to something. I say we leave him stuck in there just for a few more days so we can leverage him for business advice Right. We keep him contained. That's right. If we need questions, we just go to him. That's right. All right, all right. Hey, uh, Frank, we'll be back in a couple days to help you out, okay, buddy? No, no, no, no! Deandra, I don't have a couple of days! It's Saturday coming up. There's gonna be kids here! Hey, guys. You here for the presentation? I'm Harris Marder. Save it, bozo. We're here for the free golf clubs. You got exactly 20 minutes to do your little song and dance. We're just gonna tune out, so why don't you give us a wave when you're finished. Or don't. What's the point? I'd just be wasting my time. I mean, obviously, you two are smart. 19 minutes and 50 seconds, clown. Don't get me wrong. Invigaron is great, but you got to put in the hours. You fellows strike me more as men of leisure. Obviously. Well, we are. Yeah, I mean, this guy's got the Hawaiian shirt, you with the killer tan. Bet it's killing you guys to be stuck indoors on a beautiful day like today. It is.

Did you know that the average rate for a hotel room 30 years ago was $19? Today it's $237. That's a 1,300% increase. So it's not inconceivable to think that in another 30 years, a week at a hotel runs you That's not inconceivable. That's crazy. That's very, very conceivable. Really? Okay, but not for you guys. You'll be locked in at $1,400 annually. Wait. We would be? Yeah. I'm not talking about taking a vacation, guys. I'm talking about owning a vacation. And, look, if you're still not comfortable with the numbers, you just double down. You get two weeks, sell that second week, boom, you're vacationing for free. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Mac, I think this guy just bent himself over a barrel a little bit. He did? Yeah, for our pleasure. Follow me here. Okay, so if we buy a second week, and we sell that, we're vacationing for free. What happens if we buy a third week and sell that? We're getting paid to vacation! Oh, shit! You guys, I I've actually never thought of it like that. I know! I'm not sure I can make that deal. The deal's locked in. Deal's done. I'm gonna write in "three" Write in "three weeks." Three here that's done! Yeah, right? Put three on You got got! You thought we were a bunch of suckers, but guess what? Oh, God. We're not. We just bought three weeks of a time-share. So you did. Not a great turnout. No, not-not a great turnout. You know why? Nobody gives a shit about free soup, Charlie. People want golf clubs and concert tickets. Don't knock the soup, all right? Da'Maniac's here. He's sucked down, like, three bowls of it. Yeah, he is here. And why is he here, Charlie? Well Nobody wants to buy something from a deranged wrestler. Why would you invite him? I didn't invite him. He just drifted in. I guess he was Just looking for soup. looking for free soup, yeah, free soup. All right. You know, drifters All right, let's just get it going, all right? Yeah. Hello, everyone. Thank you so much for coming today. Each one of you has been hand-selected to potentially join our Invigaron team. "What is Invigaron?" you may be asking. Charlie? Hello, everyone. I'm Dee, and this is Charlie. And as you can tell by our huge mansion, we're insanely loaded. But it wasn't always this way. We used to be losers, like all of you people. And then we discovered the Invig Invigaron! And it all starts with the berries. The berries are the most delici I'm sure you're all excited to learn more about the Invigaron system. What the hell happened to my part, Dee? Yeah, I had to do some reshoots. You are way too hung up on the berries. The success of the Invigaron system is largely due to the simplicity of its origins. Using a multi-tiered distribu multi-level market the Invigaron system multi-level Invig I'm Andy, proud owner of my own mountain, where Did a couple reshoots of my own. Proud owner of my own mountain, where I'm a magical bean farmer. Berries! Does the sophisticated business model of Invigaron confuse you? You don't need to understand how Invigaron works, because somebody above you does. So ask less questions, and make more money. There we go. Okay. Well, I wasn't quite finished, there's Still not convinced? Well, guess what? The Invigaron system is also a pyramid scheme. "What's a pyramid scheme?" you ask. All right, basically a house of cards where the dickheads at the bottom do all the work, and give all the money to the smart guys up at the top. All right? Now, will you get Don't just be successful. Be berry You won't need a pot of gold. But still amazingly badass So do There we go. All right, any questions? I have a question. Uh, how do I get in on this? Uh, you probably don't, because you need money. Ben, how many boxes am I gonna put you down for? I don't really understand what I'm buying. You saw the video. Was the video not clear? The video was pretty clear, Charlie. You think maybe it's your stress? Do you want to check your photon levels? Oh. Yes. Yeah. Yeah, you could be stressed. It okay. Here you go. Okay. Uh, where should I put my feet? Dee, where do his feet go? The feet go wherever. What is it with the feet? Thank you for this business opportunity. I will not let you down. No, no, no, no, no. Sir, you need to pay for the product, you can't just take it out of here. Roger! Roger that. He's just he's just leaving the bar. He just stole the berries. That's not g Oh! Oh, 107. Hey, man, that's pretty good. What? Don't Healthy guy over here. Charlie, no, that's terrible. He's very stressed out and he needs to buy the product and eat the berries. Oh, shit! I-I'm sorry. Um, I don't think this is for me. Oh, goddamn it! If 107's bad, I got to eat more berries. Stop eating berries! You've had enough berries! I just don't understand. Is it a sexual thing? No, just get me the hell out! It doesn't matter! Matters to me; I don't think I can move past it. We came here for a reason. Let's just jump into it, all right? All right. Frank, we have a very exciting real estate opportunity for you in sunny Orlando, Florida. Yes. How would you like to spend one week out of the year living the high life at your own private villa at the Dusty Dunes Resort? You guys bought a time-share? Well, yeah. Yeah. How can you all be so gullible? No, no, no, no. No, this is different, Frank. This is different. Tell him. This asshole tried to sell us one week. We took the prick for three. You did? You took him for three weeks? Dennis thought of it. You think he didn't want to sell you as many weeks as possible? No, I don't think he I told you that might have been a concern, I No, I know, but I The whole way over, you said that's All right, fine. Well, look, I didn't come here to be criticized by a man stuck in a coil! Are you gonna buy a week or not? No, I'm not that stupid. We don't need this. We're out of here, Frank. Screw you. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I-I-I can help you. Yeah? I can help you. Yeah. Help us how? I'll give you a premium lead on a deep-pocket dummy. Premium lead? That's business talk. We need premium leads. Yeah. Who? You promise to get me out of here? Yeah, yeah, Frank, we promise. What do you think, we're gonna leave you in a coil? Give us a name. Ben the Soldier. All right? Ben the Soldier, huh? Yeah. Well, yeah That's pretty good. It is? Yeah. He's very, very dumb. I mean, think about it. He went over there, probably saw some pretty serious carnage. He's gonna have some bad PTSD. If we trigger that, he'll be putty in our hands. Right, whatever. Okay, get me out of here. No. Nah. Nah. Nah. No. Wait, whoa, whoa. Where you going? You just got got, Frank. Yeah. Uh, you played your hand a little too early, sucker. We'll come back when we need you again. That's called leverage. Right. That's business talk. Yeah, thought you were good at that stuff. The kids are coming! What I know. The kids! The kids will be here! Now listen. We just need to trigger his PTSD a little bit, all right? Get him all jumbled up. Couple of sudden movements. Loud noises. Exactly. Hey! Hey! Ben! It's so good to see you, man. How are you? Come on in. Have a seat on the couch, why don't you? Okay. All right. Oh, my God! Hi. Da'Maniac. Yeah, I know. What are you doing here? Well, I've come for the presentation. Gonna be really cool, huh? Oh, it's it's sort of geared specifically towards Ben, so I like him, too. He a good guy, huh? Nice to see you. Yeah. That's good. He's coming in. Hey, Ben. How you doing? All right, let's just, uh Okay, uh All right, listen, so, Ben Um, we would like to offer you a week's stay in our time-share condominium in Florida. It's an amazing property. I mean, when we first saw it, we were like, "Boom!" Sometimes, loud noises make the squirrels go in my head, and I-I don't fight in the ring anymore, but I still fight with the demons in Da'Maniac's head. All right, well, we'll-we'll try to be a little bit more sensitive to that. I Yeah. Um, and we'll keep our voices down from here on out. Yeah. Uh, Ben, should we talk numbers? Oh, I don't know. Um, and it sounds really nice, but I'm not trying to make any business decisions. I have a 107 stress level. Ooh. I'm sorry. I shouldn't be here. I-I have to go. Well, wait, Ben, stop. Ben Don't go, Ben. No, the sunshine state. Oh, uh, I'm in. Oh, no. Well, no. See, Maniac, it's very expensive. It's, like, $1,400. Sold to the Maniac for $1,400. Really? You know why? 'Cause I can pay you in Invigaron. I don't think you're quite understanding. Uh, this involves you giving us cash, not a product that we would then sell. Sure. See, we need cash money. Oh, you're We're on the same page. Okay. I don't even understand what he's talking about. Yeah. Hold on one second. No, take your time. Listen, I think we might have been wrong about Dee and Charlie's little investment. I mean, they're out there moving berries like crazy. If those bozos can do it, think how many you and I can sell. We could flip 'em, like, ten times over. That's what I'm saying. So I say we swindle Da'Maniac while we got him here. Let's get in on Dee and Charlie's little game. Smart. Pyramid scheme and a time-share? We're diversifying our portfolio. That's the thing. Okay, all right. Hey, Maniac? Yeah. Hey, you just got yourself a deal. We're in business together? Yeah. That's so cool. I'm gonna go grab my stuff, and then, if you wouldn't mind, could you show me which room is mine? I'd like a big room, if you don't mind. We're gonna have so much fun. Invigaron. Uh is-is he under the impression that our apartment is the time-share? It would appear so. Okay, you know what? We'll deal with that later. Let focus on getting Ben to crack. All right, now, between Da'Maniac stealing our berries and these night vision goggles, we're in a bit of a hole, so we got to make this count. Okay. What's the plan exactly? We're gonna trigger Ben's PTSD, all right? We bust in like Navy SEALs, zip-tie his hands, bag over his head, and then we bash him till he buys. PTSD-- that's so brilliant. How's Frank come up with that stuff? What can you say? He knows business. Okay, ready? Locked and loaded? All right. Let's go, Charlie. Let's move. Oh, oh, oh! Hey! What the hell are you guys doing here? We were gonna try and trigger Ben's PTSD and make him buy our shit. Good luck. We've been at it all night. We broke in here, looking like Arabs, screaming at him. The guy's rock solid. Why did you dress him like Ebenezer Scrooge? Yeah. He was actually dressed like at when we got here. He's clearly got some issues. I just don't know that PTSD is one of them. Yeah, we've been watching violent war movies all night to remind him of the carnage that he saw in combat. I didn't see any carnage. Um, I actually had a good time during the war. I got to travel the world, uh, try new, exotic cuisines. Well, I'm a computer programmer. What?! Goddamn it! Frank told us this dummy was the key to digging ourselves out of our financial debt. What? Frank told us the same thing. Well, that's interesting. So, we're all here doing this because of Frank. See, I told you he was up to something. Hold on a second. Getting all naked and cramming yourself into a coil-- that's a pretty good distraction, right? Right? Yeah, and think about it. He didn't tell us why he was in that coil. No, no, no. I just assumed that he went down there to pound off in the nighttime. Yeah, right, right. Yeah, me, too. Me, too. But now I'm absolutely sure he had an agenda. I bet he was never stuck in that coil at all. He's been at the top of the pyramid the whole time just gathering our cash. Oh, right, right, or at the bottom of the funnel. I'm not sure which way it works. Bottom of the funnel, top of the-- they're the same thing. Yeah, well, I bet you when we go down there, he's not even in there, is he? No. Hell, no, he's not in that coil, but I know exactly where he will be. All right, everyone, we have a new addition to the platinum sales staff, and let me just tell you something. This guy is an absolute dynamo. Scam! This guy's a liar! You guys are getting scammed! You're getting scammed! Pyramid! Pyramid! Rape! Rape! Rape! Rape! Rape! Hey, hey, hey! What's going on here? Well, I'll tell you what's going on. We are saving these people from years of financial rape. Oh, hey, if you want out of Invigaron, all you have to do is say so. Wait. I do? Huh? Look, you just, uh, sign this release form, pay a $200 penalty fee, your down line will shift up to me, and then you're free and clear. That's it? All you got to do is sign the document? Can we do that? Yeah, does that mean we're out of the time-share? Oh, no, no, I'm afraid I can't help you there. Those contracts are ironclad. I'm just relieved you didn't see the old opt-out clause. Wait a second. He just subtly motioned to this document here-- opt-out. Oh, no. Oh, crap, I've said too much. "Buyer may opt out of the contract within 72 hours for one-time cancellation fee of only $2,000." You figured it out. Oh, you fool. I have You didn't think we were gonna see this, but we outsmarted you. Yeah. We're a couple of foxes. All right, you got got! So suck on that little piece of sweetness. You also wrote "faced" in the memo. Ha! Nice! Should have known better than to get involved with a couple sharks like you two. You should have. We're just glad we're out from under Frank. Yeah. Who's Frank? Oh, "Who's Frank?" he says. Like he doesn't know. Come on, everybody. Frank's the guy who's behind all this; Frank is the mastermind in the coil. I sincerely have no idea what you're talking about. Oh, sure you don't, buddy. Well, guess what? He might not 'cause Frank Uh-oh. Oh, shit. Oh, you thought we came in mad. Wait till you see what this monster has to say. This guy? What are you talking about? This guy's the best salesman I got. Da'Maniac? Yeah. He's already got 30 people under him. I got to thank you all so much for hooking me up with that army guy. I got his whole platoon selling for me. Wait a sec. Da'Maniac's on my down line. Yup. I'm rich. I'm rich. Oh! You got got! You got got! You got got! Oh, whoa, one second. One second, guys. Actually, he's in my down line. You just bought out, remember? Shoot! No, you Oh! This guy's good. Oh, yeah. You know, sorry. I want to get this stuff done here, and then I'll meet you back at our time-share, huh? Okay. Now, what's going on there? Is he, like, living with you guys, or? Yeah. He's It's-it's a whole thing. Just move past it. That's a hard thing to move past. Yeah, doesn't know what time-share is. All right, but hold on a second, hold on a second. Is Frank still the mastermind? I don't get it. Is he still in the coil? No, he's not still in the coil. Come on, guys, he's definitely still behind this. He's probably down in Orlando enjoying that time-share. He's long gone. Right. Wherever he is, he's having a real good time. Mm-hmm. Hey! Hey, easy, easy, easy. I gotta get out of here! Get me out of here! Get me out of here!                        MAC: A reading from the Holy Bible. Genesis, chapter one. "God created the heaven and the earth, and the earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep" DENNIS: Hey, buddy, do we have to be kneeling this entire time? DEE: Yeah, this is not comfortable. I mean, it's gonna get uncomfortable. Yes, you need to be kneeling. It's 11:58, and Mac Day's about to officially start. I want there to be ceremony. FRANK: Are we gonna be in the dark the whole time? My goodness, this is a lot of complaining. Charlie, can you please remind everyone of the rules? CHARLIE: We are about to officially begin Mac Day. For the entirety of this day, we will forced to do everything Mac wants us to do. And if anyone is caught complaining? An extra day is added to Mac Day. If you cannot resist the urge to complain, you are allowed one scream a day to the ceremonial screaming pillow. That's right. Charlie, when it was your day, did I complain about searching for goblins for ten hours straight? Well, ghouls, and, no, they didn't complain, 'cause we found three. It was pretty sweet. We found none. Yeah? We found no ghouls, we found no goblins, we found no gremlins, because they don't exist. Well Guys, this whole thing was meant to bring us closer together, and by the end of it, you're gonna feel a little bit closer to me, and if I've done my job right, a little bit closer to God. Yes. Because I've modeled my day after the seven days of God's creation, making my one day feel like an entire week. Oh! Come on, man. Really? Oh, come on, will you? For crying out loud, my knees are (overlapping chatter) Three, two, one, begin! On the first day, God said, "Let there be Mac." Seven straight hours of lecturing? Yeah, and five hours alone dedicated to the evils of homosexuality from him? Did anyone else notice that he had an erection the entire time? Of course. How could you miss it? I mean, it was, like, shooting It was right there. Shh, shh, shh-- here he comes. Okay, guys, I want to introduce a new theme to the day. So I'd like to infuse the religious angle with the theme of badass. And I quote once again from Genesis. "And God said, 'Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.' And God made the firmament and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament. And it was so." There you have it. There we have what? Uh, the what? What are you saying? It's water. I'm saying "water," 'cause it said water, like, eight times. So, it's water. That's what the whole thing is-- water. Water what? Water and badass, badass and water. Ah. Yes! We're doing a Project Badass video over the Schuylkill River. Yes! Yes! Ah! Yes! Ah. All right! Hey! Do you guys hear the motorcycle? I have another special surprise. We will be joined by my cousin all day! Your cousin? Yeah, my cousin from the country. I haven't seen him in, like, forever, but, guys, trust me. He's, like, the second biggest badass I know, so it's gonna be awesome. Country Mac coming to the big city. (Frank groans) Country Mac! COUNTRY MAC: Hey, City Mac! (laughter) (both make wind-whipping sounds) (wind-whipping sounds continue) Holy shit, there's two of them. Okay, I think I like this framing. I don't even know what it is you want us to do. Well, I'm gonna jump from the Strawberry Mansion Bridge. What?! Yes! Holy shit! What do you mean, from it? To the water? What?! Yeah, I'm gonna jump from the top of the bridge to the water. Okay, I need you to act like concerned citizens, but I need this to feel real, okay, guys? So, I need you to be neutral about the jumper prior to the jump, 'cause you don't know me. You don't know this man. But I need you to react at the same time because I need to draw the jump in later to match your reaction. You lost me there. What do you mean, "Draw the jump?" You're not jumping? No, I'm not gonna jump. Of course I wouldn't jump. I draw it in later because it's like a post effect. Well, what's badass about that? Your reaction is badass, you know? I want you to scream, "Badass! You know, that dude is badass! I've never seen anything as badass as that." You know? Oh But don't say my name, 'cause you don't know this man. That's why it feels real, you know? Now, later, if you want to do, like, a Rudy-type situation where you carry me through the streets of Philadelphia, you know, that's cool. We won't. I can put that in the schedule. It's not a post effect? No, that's a practical fect, that would happen real, but only if it's organic, you know? This is a goddamn mess, this whole thing's a goddamn mess. I'm lost, I'm lost. You guys lost? You're not gonna be badass, but you're gonna And we're not gonna react? This is all sounding a little bit like a complaint from you guys. Who's complaining?! We don't know what's going on! We don't know you. (chanting): Mac! Mac! Mac! Mac! Mac! Mac! Mac! Mac! Badass! Badass! Badass! ALL: Badass! Badass! All right, Country Mac, let's do Keep it going. Keep it going. All right. Let's do this! Let's do this! Badass. Badass. (Dennis screams) It's pretty high, it's good. It's excellent, it's gonna be great. You better jump quick before somebody tries to stop you. Trust me, no one's gonna try and stop me. Jump, asshole! Yep. See, in the big city, nobody cares whether you live or die. Jump, you pussy! All right, have a nice day. Okay, so, I'm gonna run to the end, book as fast as I can to the fence, climb up to the top, stop, climb back down to safety. That's it. So, you're not gonna jump? I don't jump, okay? Why does everybody think I jump? Nobody jumps. Evel Knievel didn't jump. Johnny Knoxville doesn't jump. Okay, this is big Hollywood stuff, okay? Just stand back. I don't want you to get hurt. Let me handle it. Oh, wow! Oh, there's a man standing on the bridge. What?! Yes, he looks like Look at that. His name is Mac. No, we don't know his name. We don't know it. Oh. His name is Rudy, I believe, you guys. That's what it was-- Rudy. We don't know what his name is, and that's okay, but we don't know each other. Hi. How are you? Nice to meet you. Oh, hi, hi, but it looks like he may commit suicide. Ah! Oh! Suicide is badass. Right! No, no, no, no, Rudy's not trying to kill himself. We don't know his name. He just likes to jump, I guess. Yeah, yeah, yeah, right. Mac is the one who's the badass, remember that. Badass. No, we don't Will you stop, stop, stop? Everybody stop. Come on, guys. What are we doing? I don't know what we're doing. We got to get on the same page. It's so unclear. He gave us, like Don't know what we're doing. Maybe just you talk. Well, whatever it is, we got to get on the same page. Otherwise, we're gonna have to do it over and over and over (water splashing) Did someone just go plop? Looked like it. Someone just jumped. Someone jumped. He jumped! That's it! He jumped, guys! He jumped! The day's over, the day's over. Country Mac is gone, he's dead. Let's get out of here. Look! Look, look, look! What? What? Oh. Whoa! Oh, holy shit! Oh, my God! Oh, wow! Wow! Whoa! Well, how'd that look? Oh, amazing! All right! How did it look? How'd it look? Badass! It looked badass, dude. I cannot believe you jumped. Whoa! No, that's not really badass, guys. That's dangerous. Um, can we put him on our shoulders and parade him around like Rudy? I'm feeling that now. I want to do that. I'm feeling that now. Yeah, yeah (overlapping chatter) No, no, no, no, no, I don't think that's gonna work anymore. That's not gonna fit into our schedule, you know? I mean I mean, it was your idea (overlapping chatter) No, we're very full. We're very full now. This is not gonna play. We're gonna move on to day four now. Well, wait, wait, wait, wait. You skipped day three. Uh, day three is when God created trees and grass and nature. You know, kind of a bullshit day, so we're gonna move on to day four where God created the stars. If you look at the Orion constellation and then track across to the Big Dipper, you'll see a gaseous, cloud-like area. (quietly): Okay, I'm gonna need you guys to go ahead and ignore everything that this clown is saying. God created the stars 5,000 years ago. Uh, who has the pillow? I need a pillow. (can clicks open) I think I thought of a way that we can work day three into this experience. No, we're on day four. And, besides, there's no trees or herbs in the planetarium. But there's herb. Hmm? Who wants to smoke a "J"? Oh, shit. You brought weed? No, no, no, we're not smoking weed, okay? It's still illegal in the state of Pennsylvania. Puff, puff, pass, bitches. Yeah. Yeah, come on, Mac, shut up. I thought you were a badass. (sighs) There's nothing badass about breaking the law, Charlie. (coughs) This is gonna make it way more fun, dude. This isn't about fun. It's about fearing God, okay? I'm trying to convert you guys. Oh, my God, is that what this is about? You're not gonna convert me in one day. I don't believe in God. Well, you should. Because if you don't, God will make a flood or a famine, okay? He will destroy you with tornadoes and earthquakes and AIDS. Where do you think AIDS came from? Uh, hello, God's gift to the gays. Oh Oh, my God. You're gonna ruin this high, dude. Mac, I think you're a little confused there. I mean, yeah, sure, bad things do happen. But what about sunsets? Oh French kisses. Oh The smell of rain. Yeah. That's why I believe in God. Yeah. Not because of the things that he takes away from us but because of the things that he gives to us. Oh dude. Shit, dude. You just ripped a hole in my mind. See, that's the God I l I like that. I'm choosing that one. Excuse me, who's talking back there? Shut up, science bitch. (Charlie, Dennis, Dee laugh) Yeah. Yeah, shut up, science bitch! Aw, dude, dude, dude. Come on, man. He just said it. He just said it. He just did it. (whirring) Oh. What the hell? (machine bangs) Carbs-wise, this is gonna set me back, but I don't even give a shit. (machine bangs) Yes. Country Mac's awesome. Yes. Yeah. This weed that he gave us is awesome. It's Yes. Yeah. All these years I've been feeling like I hate karate. And, like, I hate Project Badass and, like I hate God. Yes. But, like I realize you know what I really hate is Mac. Yes. Like, he's made all those cool things suck. Not only is he, like, rui ning my life but with all this God shit that he's into he could be ruining my afterlife. Yes. (Mac grunts) I thought that one was gonna Let me try. So Yeah, I get that. Okay, I feel like we got a little bit off the rails back there, but I'm ready to get back on. Dude, did you guys see the way Country Mac was riding his motorcycle? Badass, dude! No, it was reckless once again. I thought it was awesome! He was like Batman, just zipping through the cars. He beat us here by, like, an hour. Oh, I want to get a motorcycle, man. Dude, we should all get motorcycles! Okay, that's enough! Okay? Enough about Country Mac. It's still my day. Yeah. Thank you. On the fifth day, God made fish, so we'll just skip right past that. Yeah, we'll skip that. You're skipping a lot of days, dude. Well, you can't fit it all into one day. That's preposterous. You're the one who came up with the structure, so that's preposterous. All right, on the sixth day, God created the beasts of the earth and he made man in his own image. And beholdeth the image of God. (techno music playing) Oh, shit. Okay, everybody grab some grease. Why? Because we're gonna grease up these beefcakes. No! No! Come on! No! Easy, Frank. Frank, you better take it easy! Listen! These guys work off their beautiful glutes for our enjoyment, okay? The least we can do is pay them back in tan and grease. (sighs) Greasing dudes. Yep. That's why we're here today. I ain't doing this! About time you guys got here. Hey, there you are. Country Mac, man. Hey, bro. Listen, dude, can you get us out of here? Yeah, you got to get us out of here, man. Get out of here? I'm lovin' it. I've been gettin' phone numbers left and right. Oh, sweet, there's chicks here? Chicks? No. Dudes. I'm into dudes. Oh you're gay. Loud and proud, brother. Loud and proud. Yeah, ain't nothing wrong with that. There's nothing wrong with that. Honestly, it's, like, refreshing to hear. You know what, happy hunting, bro, get after it. Cool, cool, cool. I'll see you all in a little bit. Cool, yeah, yeah. See, he doesn't want us to grease them, you know? God, that's awesome. Because he wants them. It doe Right. He wants them for himself. It's so much more comfortable when someone's gay and open about it. And, like, I know we've never said this as a group, but Mac's gay. Yeah, Mac's gay. He's gay. He's gay. I mean okay smiles. Hey! Hey! What's with all the chitchat? Legs and hammies are drying up by the second. We got stoned and we're uncomfortable. We're trying to deal with the whole thing. You guys need to start greasing some dudes or I'm gonna freak out, all right? I'm gonna freak out, and I'm gonna add another day! No, no, no. We'll grease, we'll grease, we'll grease. We're ready to grease. Give me the grease. We'll grease the dudes and Okay, that's what I like to hear. But don't blow your wads on these guys, okay? I mean We still have the karate tournament. We're gonna watch you fight? Fight? No. No, day seven is God's day of rest and judgment. So I'm gonna sit back and watch and judge everybody else in the tournament. Hey, Mac. I'm drying up over here. Sorry, Big Moe. Sorry about that. I'll be right there. Get to work. Get to work. Grease 'em up, come on. Yeah, okay. All right. Yeah. All right, bud. He's got the boner again. Yeah. Yeah. Well, at least this time it makes sense, huh? Hmm. All right, listen. I got an idea.  Ooh, I don't know about this. This doesn't feel right. No, this is good. This is gonna be good for him. I promise. This is the only way. Oh! Hey. I got you guys all notebooks and pens. We're gonna start with the yellow belts 'cause it's an inferior class. Actually, we've got a surprise for you, Mac. Yeah. We signed you up. You're competing. Huh? You're gonna go fight a guy. A black belt actually. You're in the tournament. No, no, I-I don't think that's a good idea. Mostly because I don't have the right gear, and I'm not You're wearing a gi. You are wearing a gi. Yeah, that is the gear. That's the only gear. I notice you're also wearing a black belt. Now, you are a black belt, correct? Um, not technicaly. Um, only because I haven't subscribed to one discipline. But you are good enough to fight in a black belt tournament. 'Cause you're wearing a black belt. Of course. Shit, Mac, you can do it. Just go right for the guy's throat. I know I can do it. That's not the I feel like you're talking a lot throughout the day. I know I can do it. So if you can do it, then do it. I'll sign up if Mac doesn't want to. I'm gonna do it. I said I was I was never not gonna do it. I'm excited. Yeah. I-I'm really excited to see this, man. You are gonna kick that guy's ass, whoever he is.  (Mac making whizzing noises) (exhaling) (exhales) This is cruel. Oof. I can't watch it, you know? Trust me, this is for his own good. If he doesn't face this now, he never will. Yeah, it's too bad, but he's got to get his ass kicked. Yep. It's time for this to end. Hi. Okay, now bow. Not to me, Karate Kid, to him. Oh. Bow. Bow. Ready. Fight! (audience chattering) (performing kiai) (screams) Block, point, Mac! Shit. Guys, did you see that? I got a point! I got a point! (grunts) Oh! Hell, no. (indistinct shouting) Oh! (grunting, shouting) (woman screams) (Country Mac yelling) (yelling) That was badass! He kicked the shit out of that guy! Well, I got the actual point. Who cares? You lost. Country Mac won. Yeah, but it's about the art, okay? Oh, the art. You got your ass kicked-- that's what happened. I scored an actual point in an actual karate tournament and against an actual black belt. Country Mac beat the shit out of that guy with a beer and his T-shirt. Yeah, and where is he always getting those beers, man? That's the most badass thing I've ever seen. Out of the blue, he gets a beer. No, it's years of training finally paying off, and an uncontested black belt point is the most badass Oh, my God, we're never gonna hear the end of this. Stop, stop! Hold on a second, Mac. No, no. Listen, you got your ass kicked today-- that's what happened, plain and simple. So I want you to admit it. Dennis, don't. The day's almost over. We only have a couple of hours. No, n-n-n-no, Dee, we have a lifetime of this to look forward to, and I for one can't stand it. You are not a badass, pal. Admit it to us right now. Get on your knees! You are not a badass! Oh, my God! Hey, what's wrong with you, guy? You got a problem? You got the problem, asshole. Look out! (Dee gasps) Shit. You bring a knife to a fight, you better be ready to use it, you jabroni. Just don't come back here, you punks. Aw, you made him look like a bitch! Holy shit. Nice very nice. Oh, you are badass, dude. How'd you know he had a knife on him? I gave him an ocular patdown. Assessed the threat level. Clocked a knife in his boot. Huh! Holy shit. (Charlie whoops and chuckles) Guys, I may have had a little bit of an accident in my pants, so I think I got to change out of this gi. He just gave that guy an ocular patdown, and it actually worked. It worked. He made a lucky guess, and he put us all in danger. You made a poopy in your pants! Did anybody else do a poopoo in their pants? No. Of course not. This is our head of security! I don't need to listen to this, okay? I'm gonna change out of this gi and then we're gonna keep going with the day, okay? I have a series of lectures that we're gonna get to. Go get the poop out of your pants. I can't wait for the lectures. Goddamn, man. The guy is in complete denial about absolutely every aspect of his life. And there is nothing we can do about it. I say we switch him out. Huh? Country Mac for Paddy's Mac. We send Mac to the country, bring Country Mac here. Yeah, to the bar. That's not a bad idea. I mean, look, we'd be safer with an actual badass in the bar. We might actually become a little bit more badass ourselves. We would become more like Country Mac, which'd be great. We have a lot to learn from him. We should all get motorcycles. And drink much more beer. And smoke more weed, you guys. And get in fights and do all those things. Can we make this happen before he comes back out? Let's talk to him, let's talk to him. Hey, um hey, Country Mac, can we just talk to you for one quick second, buddy? Um, listen, we were just talking and, man, we sure would like for you to stay with us. I mean, like-like, stay with us forever. Will you be part of our gang? Yep. Uh just "yep"? Just, like That's it? You're not gonna give a speech or lecture us or anything like that? No bossiness? No pontificating? It's not my style. I just go with the flow. Let the wind blow through my hair. Yeah. Oh. (starts engine) Oh, wow. I love that guy. Aw, look at him go. Where's he even going? I mean, the fact that we don't know where he's going makes him all the more badass. Uh-oh. Whoops. Whoopsie. He fell, huh? Tipped over a little bit. Ooh. He's probably okay, though, right? Well, yeah, he just popped over. A little-little bump. He's fine. He's good, he's good, he's good, he's good. (bagpipes playing) Country Mac lived a reckless life. He wasn't the kind of guy that could score a point in a black belt karate contest. And it turns out, he was totally queer. Which, as we all know, is a sin. And that, coupled with his radical religious beliefs, has most likely landed him in Hell, where he will burn for all eternity. So I will ask for a moment of silence, in which I will beg God's forgiveness for Country Mac's evil, homo ways, while simultaneously doing a series of karate moves that I know Country Mac would've enjoyed so much. (exhaling) Well, guys, I think the real lesson here is that there's nothing badass about riding a motorcycle without a helmet. Right. Plus, he was drunk all the time. Yeah. You know what's badass? Being alive. Yeah. So, uh, what do we do about this guy? (Mac exhaling) Namaste. Namaste. Okay, we will now pile into the car, where we will go to the countryside to leave Country Mac's ashes in a place that he loved so well. Actually, we won't. Because it's officially Frank Day, so (toilet flushing) All right, Pee Country Mac.                      This place has got the best hot dogs in Philadelphia. Once you nosh on these, you're not gonna want to eat another
 hot dog after this.
 Might as well get some
 snacks while we're here.
 I'm getting a beer. Don't grab a beer. We're on our way to a bar, which we own. I'm gonna get a beer, too. Are you serious? Anyone else? Yeah, I'll have a beer. Of course I want a beer. Yeah. All right, well, I'm not gonna be the only one not drinking beer, so come on. Don't move! Oh, sh Open the register. Open it! Oh, shit, oh, God, we're all gonna die. Put the money in the bag. Do it fast, or I'll blow your brains out! What are we gonna do? Put the money in the bag. Do it fast, or I'll blow your brains out! What are we gonna do?
 I will shoot you in the teeth.
 Okay.
 Give me the money.
 Hey, bozo. Walk away now, and I let you live or stick around and repent for your sins. You better step your ass back. And you better say "cheese." Huh? Crisis averted. Holy shit! Mac, that was amazing! Oh, my God. Did you like my "say cheese" line? I didn't quite get that, if I'm being honest. Yeah, I was a little bit confused by that as well. It was a pun, 'cause I flung cheese in his face, you know? No, I got that, but Yeah, but-but that's not really a pun. No. No, if you if you had taken his photograph, and then you flung cheese in his face There it is. that would be a pun. Yeah, you're taking the guy's picture, you say, "Say cheese!" That would've done it. Should I go get a camera? You know what? Yeah, he's missing the point. It doesn't matter. What you just did was badass. Oh, my God. Now let's take a look at who this scumbag is. Oh, sh oh, shit. Yakuza. Go, go! Oh, shit! Oh, my God. Hyah! Hyoh! Mac, watch out! Hah! Yah! Hyah!
 Very impressive. Your technique
 is impeccable. Cool off. Yo, Mac, that was amazing. And that's a great pun, dude. You used the pun right! Yeah, you got the pun right, dude. Huh? What pun? The "Cool off" and you kicked him in a fridge. He's not getting it, is he? No, he's not. Forget it. Don't worry about it. What is a pun? You know, move past it. I'll take his photograph. No, no. What the hell is the matter with you? Why would you do that? I killed the boss. That's not the boss, you idiot. He's my father! He owns the store! Whoops. My bad. Now, is your throat okay? Is it is that from the smoke, or? Is that a pun? Oh, my God, Mac! No! Mac, Mac, Mac. We're sorry for doubting your awesomeness. Yeah. I can't live without you. Don't die. I don't forgive you. No! No, no Why? Why? I love you! Why? I love you! God? Hello, Mac. Those were some pretty sweet moves. Thank you, my Lord and Savior. Won't you join me? Is that seat for me? You're goddamn right it is. Oh, hey, Rex. 'Sup, bro? So what do we do now? Now we ignore everyone's prayers. Put the money in the bag. Do it fast, or I'll blow your brains out! What are we gonna do? Damn it, Dee, this is all your fault. What? It's because of you. How is this my fault? It just is, you stupid bitch. Guys, you thinking what I'm thinking? Let's sacrifice her. What? Sir, sir!

By now, everyone knows the remarkable story of Dee Reynolds, a government witness whose turn as a British butler was so convincing that it was spun off into the highest rated sitcom of all time. Today she is here to talk with us about her upcoming blockbuster Mother Earth. Tell us more about it. Well, this time I play a very beautiful woman. Uh, a warrior princess who saves the world. It's already grossed over $900 million in presale tickets, but I don't care about that. You know, I'm more interested in exploring truth through character. Amazing. Yes. And I understand you've recently become engaged to young heartthrob crooner Josh Groban. When I found out that Mr. Covington was actually a chick, yeah, I had to have her. I mean, look at her. She's smart, she's sexy, she's hilarious. She pops. He likes his ladies to pop. That's true, Groban does like his ladies to pop. Isn't he cute? Sing her that song you wrote for me. Which one?

 I've got the feeling we're gonna be together a long time. That's how babies are made. But they didn't stay together a long time, their marriage only lasting a shocking 17 minutes before Reynolds met a new man whom she claimed she had to have. I'll shoot you in the teeth. Give me the money! Put the money in the bag. Do it fast, or I'll blow your brains out! What are we gonna do? Give me the money! You're going about this all wrong, friend.

The big bills, underneath. Give me the big bills.                      ALL:  Motownphilly's back again  DEE:  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da da-da-da   Doing a little East Coast swing Boyz II Men going off   Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da  Not too hard, not too soft  DENNIS:  Back in school We used to dream about this Every day   Could it really happen Or do dreams just fade away?  No, no, no, no, stop, stop, stop, stop. God, guys, damn it. I mean, you know, I need a little (sighs) a little buoyancy in the harmonies. I mean, listen to the lyrics. Right? "Not too hard not too soft." You were coming in pretty hard, I would say. The lead's got to cut through, Dee. CHARLIE: I don't know, man. I thought we sounded pretty good. Oh, we sounded "pretty good." Oh, hi, super group Boyz II Men, please let us win your contest. We sound, eh, pretty good. Come on, man. If we're gonna open for Boyz II Men at the Boyz II Men concert, we need to dazzle them with our harmonies. Mmm Okay. FRANK: He's dead. Rodriguez is dead. Frank, will you get out of here? We're in the middle of Boyz II Men rehearsal. Well, hold on a second. I'll bite-- who's Rodriguez? That sweet old man from our building. This is the worst flu that Philly has ever seen. Wow. We have to quarantine ourselves. What? MAC: Frank, we're not gonna die of the flu because we're young and vital. You are old and feeble. Actually, Frank does bring up a good point. We can't afford to get sick right now. 'Cause you know what you can't do when you get the flu? Sing? Sing. Sing. Yeah, I mean, I was gonna You wanted to say it? Yeah, but I wanted to say it. Oh, shit, well, I'm sorry, man. Uh, do you want to ask it again, or? Ask us again. Uh, you know what you can't do when you get? Nah, forget it, it's fine. Quarantine, baby! All right, this is gonna be good. Everybody find a spot to put your sleeping bags and we'll be all set. All right, Frank, where we at, my man? Well, right there. You know, you don't have to sleep together. It's a comfort thing. Guys, I got to say, I'm excited to play quarantine. Oh, my God, for the last time, we're not playing quarantine, this is a quarantine. Huh? I'm gonna get so blacked out. Yeah! What are you talking about? Mac, do you want to lose this singing contest? Why do you think we're quarantining ourselves in the first place? To protect my life! No, to preserve our vocal cords, okay? Which also means no alcohol, guys. Come on, dude! That's crazy. Wait a minute, wait a minute, that's a good idea. Because alcohol lowers your immune system. Well, why the hell are we quarantining ourselves in a bar, if we can't drink? We got to drink. Yes, hi, I'd like to order two pepperonis, one combo and breadsticks, like, a shitload of breadsticks (Frank grunting) Hey! You can't do that. This is a quarantine. Nothing goes out, nothing comes in. Especially a pizza guy. Going house to house, handling money, banging lonely broads. They're filthy! All right, come on, listen. I'm gonna take all your cell phones. You lost your privileges. Thanks a lot, Dee. It's just until the vaccine is replenished. He does make a good point, you know? Vaccines really do work. My mom used to vaccinate me, like, every month, and I never got sick. The reason you didn't get sick was because you and your mom would wear those ridiculous bubble boy suits during the flu season. Okay, what are we gonna do in here if we can't eat pizza or drink beer? Well, I'll tell you exactly what we're gonna do. ALL: Practice. Come on, man, you know, like, just let me do it. Like, why do you keep doing that? Why do you guys keep stealing that from me? ALL:  Dum-dum-dum-da-da Dum-dum-dum-da-da Die-ya-ya-yada Da-da-da-ah-oh.  Yes! That was good. That sounded that's harmony. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was terrible, let's try it again, let's try, let's do it it again. We've been working this forever. I think it's fine for now. Yeah. You think fine is good enough for the Boyz II the Men? Ah, calm down. Okay, guys, I think we're focusing a little too much on the singing and not enough on the showmanship. You know, maybe we should work out a couple of sweet dance moves, you know? What is that? Yeah. Like, that we could all do in unison. Or maybe we could wear the same outfit! Okay, yes! We'll create a visual harmony, same outfit, good. Oh, you guys, you guys, if we want to stand out, you know what we got to do? We got to focus on our story. Yes! Those competitions are all about how singing helped you overcome some major obstacle, you know? So I'll do, like, a stutter, and I'll say I got it from-from watching, like, a friend get blown to bits in Iraq. Ooh, ooh, you know what? And do it with a Southern accent and talk about Jesus a lot. Yeah! Good, good, okay, so we'll be, like, a group of, like, Southern, stuttering army vets with, like, a religious bend. Mm-hmm. Okay, and then we'll all be in the same outfit. Oh, we should be, like, carnies. We're gonna be carnies. Religious stuttering army carnies. Who love Jesus. And watched our friends explode on stage. And have pearls and sing  My friend exploded My friend exploded  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! It's great, no? Hey. No. Absolutely not. Are you kidding me? What? What? It's a singing competition. So can we please work on our harmonies? And not talk about dressing like army carnies? But then maybe one of us can be a One, two, three. (banging in distance) Goddamn it! Come out here! Come on out here. What? What? What? What is your problem? This. I found it in the back office in the garbage. It's still warm. This whole quarantine has been compromised. What me?! Come on come on. Why would I do it? You guys would suspect me. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was a recent delivery you made to Paddy's Pub. I'll get to the bottom of this. Yeah, all right, well, what was the name on the order? (Dennis chuckling) Spider-Man. That's very clever, yeah, yeah, yeah. Dennis, ask him how it's possible for him to talk to you through a cut phone wire. How is it possible for you to talk to me through a cut ph (Dennis stammers) I cut it when I found the pizza. Holy shit. Dennis is Spider-Man. No no one is Spider-Man. Fine, yeah, oh, yeah, it was me, the evil villain with the perfect voice who ordered the pizza, but, guys, you don't have to worry about me, all right? I can fight off whatever stupid illness this pizza may or may not have had, all right? I'm in perfect control of my body. Just like I am with my voice. I-I-I can go from flaccid to erect at a moment's notice. He can, I've seen it. Buddy, you're seeing it. You're all seeing it. 'Cause I'm doing it right now. Flaccid, erect. Flaccid, erect. Flaccid, erect. Not too hard, not too soft. Come on, what are you doing?! You're gonna quarantine me inside a quarantine, really? Aw, sh Now, this is the look that I was talking about. You got the bow ties and the ball caps. It's casual formal. Yeah, right, right, right. Like, are they bat boys or are they butlers? You don't know, but it's like a sweet look. DENNIS:  Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma
 ma-ma-ma.  What is he doing? Oh, I'm just warming up my voice a little bit. You guys should, uh, keep warm. Stay warm. Oh, my God, I'm loving him in the bathroom. Me, too. I mean, it's great. Now, I did a little sketch of the outfit myself. And I wasn't quite sure what you were going for. Like, if we were all each gonna be a body part, or if you wanted us mashed in this thing side-by-side somehow? What are you talking about? Well, you said that we're all in the same outfit, right? So I'm trying to figure, like, who goes where. "Same" as in "matching," not same as in jammed into the same set of clothing. Okay, not sure that's as good, 'cause this really makes a splash with the crowd. Dee, what do you think about all this? (hick accent): D-D-D-Don't- Don't put me on the spot. I-I'm just, I-I-I'm just a Jesus-loving e-e-ex-marine. That's really good. I mean, so, so sad. It's supposed to be sad. It's supposed to guilt them into voting for us, you know. (hick accent): That's not all. This Bible's a Bible of my daddy who just di-di-died in my-my arms of-of throat cancer, from-from eating some-some-some bad pussy. Hmm. Hmm. You just earned you spot at the head of the suit, Dee. That was really good. That was good. Frank, what the hell are you doing, dude? I'm getting rid of all this contaminated crap! Now, come on, you're going crazy with this food thing, Frank. We need to eat. We need to eat, but we only eat protected food from now on. Like, oranges and coconuts and snow crab. No! No snow crabs! The shells could lacerate your throats. Absolutely not. Okay, well, someone's gonna have to go out and get this food, so I'll do it. No, no, no! You can go out together. You can't go out alone. In case one of you get sneezed on, the other one can report back. Frank, tell you what. Mac and I will go out. And I guarantee we won't get sneezed on. All right, dude, first things first. Let's get some beer, man. You know, screw Dennis and his rules. The guy's, like, you know, such a dick about shit. Yeah, dude, he can be so controlling, you know? He can do really cool stuff with his dick, though. You gotta ease up on talking about dicks, man. Like, it's just, it's too much by this point. You think? Oh, wait a second. There's no, there's no opening to this. Shit, I'm sorry, dude. I forgot, there's no opening in yours. But my mom rigged hers with a special pouch so that she could have her cocktails. See? It fills up. Your mom rigged her suit so she could drink booze? Dude, you mom's an alcoholic. My mom's not an alcoholic! No, bro! She is, but it's totally cool, because it skips a generation. That's why you're not an alcoholic. (woman coughs, Mac gasps) That's not good right there, man! There's too many bogeys! Let's get some fruit, let's get out of here, let's get back to the quarantine. That's right, man. Let's get out of here. Whoa! Stop! What is this? I love it! Huh? What was all this? Oh, it's just a little dance move I've been working on. It's stupid. I was just practicing. No, man, that's sweet as hell. Show me that shit. You like it? Yeah! It sort of like a Fly Girl power spin. I've been working on it. It's a You want to see the whole thing? It's sort of a Whoo! (grunts) Oh, shit, you all right? It's a balance thing. Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! You got a breach! Oh, shit! Come on. Hey! Close your pit! Close your pit! Don't tell Frank. I won't tell Frank. Hold your arm. Don't tell Frank. Hold your breath. Go! Move! Charlie, don't tell Frank! Look at all the hair. Look at the hair. It's like a goddamn barber shop. Be on the lookout, Deandra! Yeah, copy that. Looking for hair. Stop talking about hair, please. It's very annoying to me. That's what carries the disease, Dennis-- the hair. We don't really need it. Look at us. We're evolving without it. We came from the apes, and look at us now. One day, we'll be completely hairless and totally pure. Yeah, you should write that down. What are you doing? Cleaning, cleaning. You know, you said scrub the place from top to bottom. And it was a good thing that I did, too, because I'll tell you what. Mad dusty up there. Yeah, good-good good thinking. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Were you eating pizza and drinking beer up there? Yes, Frank, I was eating and drinking in a ceiling. I mean, will you use your head? No, I'm getting a little stir crazy. Yeah. That's-that's Yeah, it's driving you nuts. Driving me nuts. I get it. Right. One more thing. Hmm? That's not mine. (Frank growls) Hey, Frank, are you kidding me? Goddamn it, it's just one beer! Oh! It only takes one germ, Dee. Oh, Jesus! Of course, how anybody thinks that a germ could survive a scalding hot pizza is beyond me. (coughs) Oh, Dennis, you don't look good. Trust me, Dee, if I found myself getting sick, I would simply say "Sickness be gone!" (Dennis groans) (Dee shrieks) It's all here, you know: oranges, hand sanitizer, basically everything. No snow crabs, you know. Hey, where's Dee? Quarantined. There was a breach. No breaches on your end, right? No. No, no breaches. Yeah. Everything's cool. No, no, breaches. Yeah, everything was cool. Yeah, everything was good. Good. I'm gonna go shave. Get all this filthy hair off my face. Oh. Then when I come back, we'll play some games so nobody goes nuts or nothing. (humming) Uh, movie, movie. Okay, movie. Two, three, four, five words. Doesn't matter? Ocean's Eleven. Ocean's Twelve! Ocean's Thirteen! Frank, I can't concentrate when you look like this. You look ridiculous, man. It was What's Eating Gilbert Grape? That's where all the bacteria lies, Charlie, in your hair. That's why I shaved it off. Now it just flows off my body. You should do the same, mm-hmm. (Mac sneezes) He breached! He breached! His suit ripped in the store! He tried to do, like a power spin, and it ripped. And he probably got sick! That's not true! Oh, you rat! This is bullshit! This is bullshit! I feel fine. (door closes) You should stand over there 'cause I think I'm really getting the flu. Oh, I'm-I'm sick as a dog already. Oh, if you guys are getting sick, then stay away from me. Holy shit, dude! I think we need to call 911 for you. Hey, should we work on our harmonies? Seriously, dude? think we need to get you to a hospital. (singing high-pitched note) Does that sound like a man who needs to be in a hospital? Yeah, dude. From the top. (weakly):  Motown Motownphilly  (Dennis retches) (Dennis vomiting) (Mac retches) (Dee retches) (all vomiting) (Charlie chewing) Charlie? Charlie, look at that. Look how clean I am. Dude, you look like a shriveled raisin. It's all about purity, Charlie. Humans are filthy. Dirty filthy. All right, man. You got to mix in with beasts fowl, rodents. People do what they do, man. What am I gonna do about it? When I get out of here, I'm gonna clean Philadelphia. Good. A giant cleanse. Well, good luck with that. Not the city the population. Okay, well go for it. I can't stop shaking. It's so hot and also so cold. What's up, what's up? Talking hot and cold? Mm-hmm. Charlie, are you sick, too? Hmm, sick? Nah, Frank's all trying to shave me and shit. I'm like, "Dude, no way." So, I figured I'd hang out with you guys instead, you know? We're very sick, we have the flu. If you, if you stay in here, you're gonna get sick. Good, he deserves it for ratting me out. Please, Mac, I've been vaccinated for every disease in the book. I'm gonna be just fine. (Charlie retching) Oh, God. That's a lot of throw up. This flu is so brutal. (Dennis coughs) Hey, guys? I think I might be coming down with something, too. Are you kidding me, dude? Like, I think you're gonna die. I think I'm gonna die. I've never felt like this before in my life. If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna go down drinking. Anyone want some booze? I knew you drank cleaning supplies. Oh, no, dude, this is booze. I stash whiskey in here. Dude, you are an alcoholic. Whatever. Dee stashes warm beer in the ceiling of the back office. I keep a flask of crÃ©me de menthe behind the jukebox in the bar, it's not a big deal. Just drink, you know, because this might be our last chance. Bottoms up. (Dee groans, gulps) I'm not getting it. So you crawl around on the bed, looking for minerals? Uh, no. If I'm looking for minerals, I got to be under the bed. Minerals on top of the bed doesn't make any sense, actually. None of this makes any sense. It's insane. You know, I don't know about you guys, and I don't know why this is happening, but I actually feel a lot better. Well, you look better. You guys all look better. I'm actually feeling better, too. I feel great. Yeah. How is that even possible? All we've been doing is sitting here and drinking. How could we have gotten better so quickly? Oh, my God, you guys. You guys, we haven't been drinking since we quarantined ourselves into the bar. At least since we got stuck in the bathroom. Oh, that's right. Wait, wait, wait, so what are you saying? That-that we never had the flu? We were just having alcohol withdrawal? Yeah. Alcohol withdrawals! That's great! Is it great? It means we're all alcoholics. MAC & CHARLIE: Ah Yeah, yeah right. What do we do with that information? What do you do with any information? You just stuff it deep down inside and keep an eye on it. You keep it. I'm certainly not gonna stop drinking. I mean, I physically can't. No, no, not at this point. We're in, we're in too deep. Yeah. I'm a, I'm a young guy. Just kids having fun, right? That's right. We got an audition to make. So let's bust this door down, Mac. What do you say, you want to roundhouse the door for us? I was gonna suggest that. Yeah, I know you were, buddy. That's why I said it. Just do it and get it over with. Okay. Hold on, hold on, though. If we don't want to break the door, I have a key. You've got a key?! We've been in here this whole time, and you could've let us out?! I didn't know that we were trapped in here. I thought we were just playing quarantine. What the?! No, we're not playing quarantine. We're quarantined. Let's go. Just open the door. Yo, Frank! We're not sick. Yeah, we're fine, dude. We Whoa. What the hell is this? Oh, shit, I think it's hand sanitizer. Hmm? Hand sanitizer? Where is it going? Frank? Uh, why is there hand sanitizer all over the floor? It goes in here and Oh! Frank? Oh, my God! What the hell did you do to yourself? I just want to be pure. God, what are we gonna do about this? Probably get him to the hospital, right? Yeah. Ooh, let's make a quick stop first.  Motownphilly's back again  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da  Doing a little East Coast swing Boyz II Men going off   Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da  Not too hard, not too soft   Da-da-da-da-da-da-da  Boyz II Men, ABC, BBD Mm-hmm. So, what do you think? In your professional opinion, you think we got a shot? I mean, we're talking about Boyz II Men here. We want to go and we want to win. Yeah. Boyz II Men? That concert is canceled. What? Why? Yeah, yeah, they all got the flu. Oh, son of a bitch! So we did this for nothing? Well, I mean, no, not nothing. I mean, guys, look, we came together in harmony. You know, if I'm being honest, I'd rather go back to the bar and get drunk, than go to some, you know, concert. Yes! You know what, guys? We can sing at the bar like we always do. That's right. Yeah, but drink. Oh, yeah. 'Cause I want to drink. And we got to stay healthy. That's right. We have to stay healthy. We'll always drink. Well, then from the top, shall we? Okay.  Motownphilly's back again  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da  Doing a little East Coast swing.  Okay, we've got to get that sanitizer off you, huh? You ready for your sponge bath? Shit.                      So what if I didn't go to college? John McClane didn't go to college. He defeats the bad guys using street smarts, and I got street
 smarts.
 Mac, you do realize John McClane's a fictional character who's voicing lines written by screenwriters who almost certainly went to
 college.
 Yeah, but Bruce Willis dropped out of college, and that supports Mac's argument. Yeah! Uh, no it doesn't, Dee. And the fact that you can't understand that leads me to believe that you are complete and total dum-dum, and therefore are not going to get selected for this intelligence experiment. Welcome, everybody, and thank you for volunteering in this intelligence experiment. I'm afraid, however, that we can only use one test subject. I-I'm sorry, before you continue, um, I noticed you said "volunteering," which implies a lack of compensation. Volunteering's for suckers. Yes, the selected subject will receive $1,000 in compensation. There you go. That's what we're talking! That's more like it. Okay, and listen, when it comes to intelligence, I think you'll find that I am your man. Or perhaps a man is not what you're looking for at all. I'm afraid my friend Dennis confuses book learning with brainpower. But you and me, we know different, huh? Uh, "you and I." What? No, not you and I. Him and I, idiot. In case I was being unclear, nerds, I will bang one or both of you. Dee, this man is smart enough to know to avoid a proposition like that from someone like you. To be clear, we're not looking for a subject with superior intelligence. In fact, the complete opposite would be, um, uh, preferable. Excuse me for a minute. I'm sorry, wait, wait! That's a sorry.
 What are you doing?
 I was gonna bash your rat and take care of your rat problem. Oh, no, no, no, no, please, please, this is, this is our lab rat. His name's Armitage Shanks. If he solves the maze, he gets the cheese. And since we've been feeding Armitage a cerebral enhancement formula, he's been solving these mazes seven times faster. We'd like to try a formula out on a human subject. What would you think about something like that? A pill that could make you seven times smarter. Cheese, huh? Yeah, all right. Ow! Shit! What's your name, young man? It's Charlie. Hold up, dude, I want to get this cheese here. Aah! Shit! Why don't you try the cheese under the green light, Charlie? I want this cheese. Aah! Ladies and gentlemen, we have found our test subject. Thank you all very much for coming. Aw, Frank, you're intruding upon my education. This is crazy, Charlie. That's crazy. Aw, shut up. Whoa, what the hell is this? What are you doing, man? Well, I'm trying to learn Mandarin and listen to Beethoven at the same time. You see, I just realized that I have two ears, so it's a waste to only listen to one thing. Let me guess this straight. You just realized that you have two ears? Taking a pill is not gonna make you smarter, Charlie. I don't know about that, Frank. I've listened to five books on tape already this morning, five. Charlie, come on, any idiot can listen to books on tape. You're only doing that because you can't read, all right? Trust me, if you're feeling any smarter, it's just a classic
 case
  of the placebo effect. I considered that, but I don't think that's it, Dennis. Whatever, you don't even know what the word placebo Placebo means from the Latin "placebo," meaning "I shall please." I listened to a chapter on that this morning. This is Such bullshit? I wasn't gonna say Gonna say that? Dude, just because you're finishing our sentences, doesn't
 make you s-s-s
 Intelligent. Oh! Guys, guys, we've got a huge problem back there. Ugh, big rat, like the biggest ever in the back office. Uh, that sounds like Charlie work, so, Charlie, why don't you hop on that, and be smart about it. Good pleasantry, cute. How about no? What do you mean "no"? How about you kill the rat? You know what, that might occupy you guys for about a week or so, and that'll give me some time to continue my education in peace. That be nice. Let's do that. What are you talking about? A week? To kill a rat? Wh-wh-what kind of a genius rat are we talking about? You have to be a real moron to get outsmarted by a rat, dude. Well, bonjours, killing the the rat, my friends. You're Oh, and then I realized, Tang See, that these so-called friends of mine have been exploiting my labor for years. An astute observation. Conforms with Marxist theories about the exploitation of the proletariat. It completely conforms when you think about it. Ah, Tang See, these-these pills are having quite an effect on me. And the combination with my readings is really leading me into some rather large ideas. I think I could be on the verge of something groundbreaking. Yes. The work you're proposing will revolutionize the field. Exactly, right? Now, Tang See, let's-let's talk for a second. What do you think my IQ is now? And be honest. Well, what do you think it is? Wow. You know. Probably, yeah. Now, I'm thinking if I were to double the dosage, I could break You have to be careful, Charlie. This is uncharted waters here. Have you been having any side effects? Yes. Okay, yes. There's-there's been a-a slight ringing in my ears. My-my legs grow numb from time to time. I ache all over if I'm being honest, but I got Mongolian barbecue and Police Academy: Mission to Moscow. Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, I got to stop you. Uh, tonight is really not the best night for that, so I'm sorry, man. But, Charlie, it's Gruesome Twosome Tuesday. Yeah, uh, I know it is, pal, but What? I'm-I'm on the verge of something really groundbreaking here and I-I really shouldn't be playing these childish games anymore, nor should you. We're the Gruesome Twosome. You don't have to keep saying that, I know The sound effects won't help you. The Gruesome Twosome. They don't further your argument in any way. You speak Mandarin? Well, I do think I'm getting it a little bit. Hey, Mac, Mac, I've located him-- he's right near the hole. Oh, good, let me bash him! No, no, no Oh, goddamn it. He scurried away. All right, well, when he comes back, I'm gonna smash him up good. No, no, Mac, come on. We're smarter than that. That's just gonna spread rat blood and disease all over the place. It's not about brute force. It's about seduction. See, I'm gonna place some enticing tunes for the little guy. And then I'm gonna bait this glue trap with some Brie cheese.  And I want you here With me  From tonight until The end of time You should know  Hey, you guys catch that rat yet? Any minute now, Dee. I'm telling you, glue traps are barbaric and messy. I have come up with the intelligent solution. Ultrasonic rodent repellant. It emits a high-pitched sound that obliterates their teeny rat eardrums. Stupid rats. Uh, those things don't work, Dee. Oh, no? Okay, how about we do a little wager. The rat gets trapped to your glue trap and you win. The rat scurries away and never comes back again, then I am crowned the smartest in the Oh, God, gross. Is that cheese? Get it off me! Get it off, I'm st I'm stuck to your glue! You guys! You've trapped yourself on a trap that was designed for a rodent with a brain the size of a walnut. Now a normal-size woman would probably just be able to slide her hand right out, but with those giant man hands Yeah, you really don't stand a chance, Dee. Okay, I get it. Do you hear that? I hear it-- oh, God, it's coming! It's coming to eat its cheese. You guys, help! Odd that it hasn't been repelled by your supersonic rat scarer, Dee. Guys! It's on me! It's on my hand! Oh, it's climbing up my hand to eat the cheese. Now, where this gets interesting is when the rat finishes the cheese. Ooh, yes, maybe it'll nibble her hand down to a tiny, bloody stump, then she could just slide it right out. Hey. Ah, goddamn it, it's gone. It ate its cheese and then ran away. It didn't get stuck to the glue. Huh, maybe this rat is a little bit smarter than we gave it credit for, Mac. Hmm. He is whatever, I mean, is he okay? Sure. Is he fine? He's fine. All I'm saying is that Stephen Hawking is much more of a Lady Gaga than, you know, Johann Sebastian Bach. He-he's not, he's a pop culture figure like the Kardashians, you know? Hmm. God. Are you all right? Yes, that's the shooting pain in the eye. Jot that down, please. Huh? Yes, I heard-heard the words. I'm learning Mandarin. It means "You got that right." Yes, Frank, I got what right, though? The thing about the cripple. What cripple? Why are you speaking? Stephen Hawking. Dear God, we were talking about that like ten minutes ago. But I didn't know what I was gonna say. I had to look it up. You never know what you're gonna say, and that's the problem, isn't it? Say that again? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, you're going too fast, I can't Go slower. Frank, I cannot go slower for you! Checkmate, Tang See, wake up. Open your eyes, listen. I cannot go slower. Frank, I am thinking on the physical level, the metaphysical level, the pataphysical level. Every time you open your mouth, you drag me down into the mud, and-and really, my-my What? You got a pain? Charlie, I'm telling you. Those pills are no good for you. They're hurting you, those pills. They're turning you into someone you're not. Shut up! Okay, okay. Don't get cute, Tang See, you're not much smarter than he is. Checkmate. Well, you know, it-it, uh hmm Try jerking it again. Jerked it, I mean, I've jerked it so many times. I've jerked and squirmed and squiggled. This is crazy. I mean, we should be able to figure this out. Ooh, oh! What about gasoline? Pour a little bit of gasoline on there, dissolve some of the glue. You are a brilliant man, yes! Try it. Yeah, gasoline is a solvent. That's basic chemistry. Smart, Mac, smart, go grab some. Oh. Yeah. Yeah, all right. Ohweot to be careful though because gasoline is volatile and highly combustible so let's use extreme caution. Of course, only an idiot would just use gasoline willy-nilly. It's gonna work. Okay. And in the interest of safety, I'm gonna go ahead and just make sure that this is, in fact, gasoline because Charlie likes to keep booze in here sometimes. That's true, he does do that. Mm-hmm. Yeah! Yeah, yeah, that's definitely Let me double check because, you know, you're sense of smell has always been pretty stupid. You want to? Yeah, yeah, let me just check it out. Oh, oh, Christ, that's good stuff that's high-test. Can I get a toot down here? Yeah, yeah, go for it, go for it. Ooh, guys, yes. Are you sure it's gasoline though? I should just try it again. Jesus, Jesus! That's gasoline. All right, let's blast off. Engage thrusters, Captain. Oh, all right, well, ground control, I'll take some. Holy shit. As long as we're blasting. You know what? Let's pop off on this shit a little bit, then let's get back to business. Yeah, okay. This is making me feel Oh, shit, there he goes. Oh, he's a squirrely little bastard, isn't he? You son of a bitch. He's making I and you look dumb. Yeah uh "I and you." No, me and you, me, you, me, I. It was you and I? You and I Me and you look dumb. Dumb. It's got to be Dumb is a funny word. me and..mb. Du is a funny word. Dumb. Dumb. Pass the gas. Dumb. Pass it, pass it. Pass the gas. Oh, yeah, you're reading now? Since when do you read? Oh, hello, hello. Uh, well, I was just glancing at War andPeace, and let me tell you, I side with Shakespeare on brevity. "Brevity is the soul of wit." Which, uh Do I have to put on training wheels for this conversation or is, uh What is this? What are you doing? I'm having dinner with you. I see, you've lifted the restraining order? Oh, no, no, no. I'm not lifting the restraining order, but Frank paid me $500 to be here, and so I'm having dinner with you. Ah, I see. Do you? 'Cause I don't. I didn't ask questions though. Well, it's all rather transparent really, isn't it? Frank and I have always been very close as you know, uh, but I've turned a corner, if you will, with my life recently. I have new, more substantial interests, new friends, better suited for those interests, so understandably Frank is feeling somewhat marginalized. Now, he's gone out of his way to enlist your aid, uh, in hopes that my deep infatuation with you will, uh, perhaps pull me away from those people and those pursuits that have, in turn, been pulling me away from Frank as of late. What now? Frank's using you to get to me. How are you? Never mind. Moving on. Beaujolais? Why don't you have a little bit, loosen up. That'll get rid of that uninviting edge. So, uh, tell me about yourself. Are you quite well these days? Well, uh, actually, I'm, like, okay because my boss, like, at the restaurant, he, like, totally doesn't get me. I mean, he thinks that being a waitress is, like, what I am, and I'm like, "That doesn't define me, dude, okay? Like, I'm saving up to open my own nail salon." And I have come up with all of these great names for a nail salon. Um, some of them are, like, The Hand Whisperer or Finger Fantasy. And I've been watching Tabatha Takes Over a lot because it's a show that takes place in salons. Finger Fantasy. Finger Fantasy. I've been watching this show called Tabatha Takes Over Tabatha Takes Over, Tabatha Takes Over. And I have been watching Tabatha Takes Over a lot, because it's a show that takes place in Yeah, see? The mouse always wins. There's there's, like, no winning with mices. Cat keeps getting hurt. He gets hurt. Well, it's dangerous, yeah. What the hell are you guys doing? We're trying to watch cat and mouse cartoons to find out how kitty cats deal with their rat issues. If Charlie was still around, none of this would be happening. He's distracted with that damn literature and science crap. Charlie is our foundation. Where does a foundation belong? Yes. On top. On the bottom. Oh. On the bottom. We gotta go grab Charlie and drag him back down into the sewer where he belongs. Oh Well, well I can't, see I've been outsmart by a rat and right now I'm stuck on its glue trap. Did you try the gasoline, loosening it? All over it. That didn't work, but you know what does work? Breathing it in. Deandra, are you holding onto the trap? No. Oh, I don't I don't know. Let go of the trap. No No. That's so stupid. All right, come on. We gotta go get Charlie. Uh, no, no. We'll do it. Let's do it tomorrow. We'll nap first. Could you turn the TV back on? Tomorrow's good. Ladies and gentlemen, you're about to see the results of a bold experiment in human intelligence. He's totally different. Totally different person. We'll bring our test subject out now, and I think you'll find him a rather incredible specimen. Tang See. Ah What is happening? Thank you, Tang See, my-my dear, dear friend. A simple pill ingested by a man who received a simple idea, a simple thought so clear and sharp that it cut through his mind like a soft cheese and led him to an invention. Is he doing an accent? Yeah. Every now and then, there are new modalities, new ways of being and understanding our world. This invention-- my invention-- will change everything. For the better, one hopes. But the good of the scorpion is not the good of the frog, yes? You must excuse me. I've grown quite weary. Come on. Finally, my friends, at long last the day has come. We have the means, the understanding, the technology to allow spiders to talk with cats! Our exploration into the effect of environment upon intelligence was, alas, a complete failure. Self-confidence instilled by a placebo "intelligence pill" and consistently reinforced by my assistant Tang See did not, in fact, make the test subject smarter. It did, however, yield fascinating results. Uh, the most measurable effect was a sharp uptick in arrogance. The subject was perfectly ready to believe he had learned Mandarin in two days. Tang See! Again, this is complete gibberish. The subject believed himself to be a mathematical wizard. plus nine equals box. All right? That's where the cat goes. And in the space of an hour, the subject has lost all interest in a woman with whom he had been in love for years, because of a perceived upidity relative to himself. Perhaps the most interesting were the series of side effects that he believed himself to be having. Uh, debilitating aches and pains. It was all-all in his mind. Huh. Yeah, I guess I do feel kind of better, so I believe I was having the "plecebe" effect. Placebo. Pla-ce-bo. Which is, of course, a a funny-sounding word. That is a funny word. Pretty funny, yeah. "Placebo." "Placebe." Placido Domingo. Police Academy. Which is a good movie, Frank. It is a good movie, Charlie. You want to go back and watch it? With all my heart. Please, can you not interrupt the lecture? We're still, uh What is the point of this stupid, dumb-ass experiment anyway? Yeah, like, was he smart or not? I don't even get it. Uh, I don't think so. Was I smart, sir? No. Again, um if you could let us finish the lecture, and You stupid science bitches couldn't even make my friends more smarter. Hey, you're right! Stupid science bitch couldn't even make I more smarter. All right, let's get out of here. Hey, Charlie! Police Academy. Police Academy is an awesome movie. Mahoney! Mahoney's my favorite character.                       Bah-hoo-yeah Bah-hoo-yeah Bah-hoo-yeah Bah-hoo-yeah.  Welcome back from the dead, Chief Lazarus! I only got one thing on my mind. Revenge! What exactly are you here for? We need $40 million. So we've shot a great deal of the movie, and we're gonna show it to you. We just need a little money to finish it. Yeah, see, we had a little bit of a falling out with our financier. He's also playing Chief Lazarus. Just, we had some creative differences with him, you know, which is why we're coming to you, but, look, that's neither here nor there. Don't worry about that. The guy wanted to shoot a full penetration sex scene and show it. But, to be fair, I don't have a problem, as much, with the act itself as I do with the man who's performing it. Don't get into that. It's, like, more specific than she needs to Let her know. I think she Look, I just, I think that no one wants to see Frank smashing genitalia with a woman, but if it were me doing it, you know, imagine that. Wouldn't that be nice? Imagine all the positions that I could get into. You know, reverse pile driver, seated scissors, wheelbarrow, reverse cowgirl. I know all the positions. Whatever you like. He can do 'em all. I can do 'em all, yeah. He can do 'em all. So imagine that. Do you see the difference? We don't finance movies here. Let's show her more of the movie. Get into the story a little bit. Okay, that's exactly right. Keep watching, and then see the big picture, know that there are budgetary and time limitations and ignore them, please. Yeah.
 In your face, sucker.-  Oh, shit! Riggs, what the hell are you doing here? Our relationship is strained. Thought I'd give you some pointers on your jump shot. Noticed you weren't squaring up on the basket. Schooling a black man on basketball. You must be crazy. Crazy enough to want to know why you never RSVP'd to my wedding. Gee, do I want to see my ex-special forces ex-partner marry my baby girl daughter? Thanks. I respectfully say, "No." I tell you what, Sarge. Let's play a quick game of one-on-one. You score on me, you don't have to come to the wedding. If I score on you, I don't have to come to the wedding? That's right. So all I do is score once, and then I don't come to the wedding? Yes. Well, this is gonna be a slam dunk!  Break a leg. Hell, break both of 'em. Heavenly Father, we thank you for your glories. We also thank Martin for his lovely sax solo in lieu of vows.
 Rianne will now recite hers.
 My love, when I look deep in your eyes, I find my own destiny. I find that I want to love you for the rest of my days, and I will. I will spend every day of my life trying to make you the happiest man in the whole world. That was lovely. If anybody has any objection to this union, you speak now, or forever hold your peace. I object. What?! I need to do something first-- get your father's blessing. I came here for my daughter, not you. I love her, Rog. Yeah. I know you do, pal. No! No! I love weddings. They always such a blast! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Got to get out of here! Got to get out of here! Oh! Oh, let me out of here! Let me out of here! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Um I don't get why you're making this. Oh, I mean Oh God, the bank didn't get it either. Why make anything, you know? For the money, for the glory, for the fame. Absolutely. All-- the whole thing. Yeah, and-and clearly the movie's pretty kick-ass right up until we get to the special effects snafu. Our ex-backer liked to cut corners, but we feel like, with your technical expertise, being from a dot-com company and all, and your money, we could really make a kick-ass movie. Yeah, now, the next scene is, um, the next scene is bad. The next scene is a little bit of a disaster. It's got some problems, too, but then, once we get past that, it's pretty good, but let me set this up for you so you're not totally confused. Somebody released some kind of a biting bug, the likes of which I've never contended with. Frank and I got them from China, and they just went crazy in the bar and bit us up like What do you mean you "got them from China"? You ordered them? Don't worry about where we got them or why we were getting them. Oh, my God, Jesus Christ. We just released them, there was an issue All right, so you're gonna enjoy this part. Go ahead and push play. Yeah, yeah, keep it going. Hey, Chief, I'd like to trade in these flowers for a badge. Well, I just happen to have that gun. Welcome back to the force, Riggs. Murtaugh. Murtaugh! It's great that you're a cop again, Rog. We'll n-need it. Well, I had to come back because they killed my baby girl as you was getting married to her. Yeah. Looks like I'm not the only cop with a death wish now. Ha! Chief, I think I found some clues. What the hell does those things have to do with Chief Lazarus? Well, I've got a hunch. Chief, I've got a hunch. See, feathers were usually used in Indian resurrection burials, which could only mean one thing. Damn! Well That Lazarus is back from the dead. Damn! You think? So he's probably planning an elaborate rain dance to drench L.A. so bad that it ends up in the ocean. Making his Indian reservation the only thing left standing and very valuable beachfront property. That's could be the only answer. Yeah. Oh, oh. I'm just gonna fast-forward for a minute. Uh, but this Yeah, this is important That-that-that's okay, I'll, uh, I'll play it here. Beachfront property on his Indian reservation. No, you're still going on about the whole No, just keep going. Yeah yeah, yeah. Well, you got to explain every aspect of the movie. That's crazy. Well, that's because when you go to the movies, you know, you can't follow what's going on. No, you can't follow what's going on. Yeah, yes, you can. No, no, you're like, "Who's that guy? Is that the good guy, is that the bad guy?" Everybody knows! I'm sorry, guys, um, but maybe it would help if I saw the original Mel Gibson version first. W-What do you mean that you've not seen Wha? How? You've never seen Lethal Weapon? Lethal Weapon? No, I mean, I've heard of it. I think what's happening here is the fact that you're a woman, and our demographic skews male. Well, um It does-- we are a male- driven, uh, you know We are testosterone-driven. We're a male-driven entity. I-I got, I got that. Oh, oh, oh, the next scene. Oh, yeah, yeah, right, right, right, right, right, right. Oh, the next scene. That's right, there's stuff for the the ladies, I guess. Oh, for the ladies. Yeah, we shot this for the ladies. This is all for the ladies. You're gonna love this. Well yeah. You're gonna dive right in, right here. ("Playing with the Boys" by Kenny Loggins playing)  I'd say it was The right time To walk away  When dreamin' takes you Nowhere It's time to play  Bodies workin' overtime Your money don't matter  Yeah!  Time keeps ticking When someone's on my mind   Playing Playing with the boys I'm staying Playing with the boys  Yeah. All right. All right, blokes, let's hit the showers, huh? Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. I don't know about you, mate, but I'm sore. I'm really sore. I really needed this. Oh, I needed it, too, mate. All right, buddy. Now that we know what Lazarus' plan is, what are we gonna do? We got to track him down and fight him, you know? Sure do. We got to track him down and punch him. We're gonna track him down and we're gonna We're gonna go to the strip club, which I'm excited to do. I love strip clubs. Oh, baby, I love me a good strip club. We're gonna I mean, this is crazy, right? Wha? I miss her, Riggs. Nothing's ever gonna make me forget her. I know, buddy. Lazarus has taken everything from us, but we're gonna take what he loves most: his life. Yeah? Well, we'd better do it right this time, baby. We ain't getting any younger. That's for sure. I'm starting to think even I'm getting too old for this shit. Say what? Oh That's what you always say. I know. I brought it back. That's your Yeah, I got that. Whoa, shit. Come here, you rascal. Whoa! You want to wrestle, you You want to go, old man? You young, but you ain't that strong, baby. You want to go, old man? You want to go, old man? You too young for this Whoa, whoa, whoa, what is this? What are you showing me here? We're showing you a testosterone-driven, male- skewing action melodrama. Yeah, you're gonna love this stuff. And, by the way, as a hedge fund manager, you're used to this kind of high-stakes, adrenaline-pumping action, so this should be perfect for you. I'm a little confused. Oh, is it the character- switching? 'Cause, just move past that, all right? Trust me, our audience has come to expect that kind of thing from us. No, no, no, I'm confused about what you want. Uh, you need money to fund your gay yasak movie? Oh, goddamn it, Mac. Gay yasak movie? What are you talking about? See? See! You even watching the movie? Yes, in a lot of ways this is a love story between two men. No, it isn't. Okay, yes, in a most ways. No, it isn't. All right, but this is about as masculine as it gets. It's not, it's not, I mean No, it isn't, no, it isn't. You had a butt-double. Oh, of course I had a butt- double. You think I'm gonna show my butt on camera, Charlie? Oh, my God, I was uncomfortable filming the scene. It's not up to the par of Murtaugh, okay? If you play the movie, you'll see It gets way straighter, I promise. Push play, you're gonna love this next part. We'll cut that stuff out. See, nobody wants that I sure am glad we came to this strip club, Riggs. I do like looking at beautiful naked women. That's because we're not gay. Right, right. Up next is Lady Starship. She's gonna blow you away with her celestial body. Lady Starship-- I like the sound of that. Man, what the hell! Oh, what the f  That's more like it. Yeah. You like that? I do, yeah. What are you looking at, man? Shit. Frank, will you pay attention, man? I mean, come on, we've been all over town. We went to a hedge fund guy, a dot-com girl, we went to banks. No one's gonna fund this thing. No, we need to finish the movie, Frank. All right, I'll give you the money. But we do the movie my way. I want what I want. And you know what I want. That's not cool, man. We can make it work, we'll just have to add some exposition-- a whole scene of it. What needs to be explained? It's gonna be perfectly clear! It's gonna be way too clear what's happening. Frank, it's gonna ruin the movie, Frank! It's gonna be so confusing It's not gonna be it's not gonna be confusing. We got a deal or what? Ah! Damn. Damn! They found us! We got Lazarus trapped in his own umbrella factory. Yeah. He gonna do a rain dance and then make some money on some umbrellas, man. He a dirty bitch. Come on, let's go get him. I'm gonna jump over this! Get over it! I got you, Riggs! Hurry up! Oh, I'm getting too old for this shit. Come on, man! We're pinned down, Rog. This could be it, good buddy. This could be the end. Okay, Rog, if this is the end, we should be the ones to end it. You know what? I got this. I got that weird Danish twin. Oh, shit! Aw, damn! He got away. Oh, hey, you know what? We got to also remember to get that shaman priestess from the beginning. We don't want her bringing him back from the dead again. That's a good point. Where's Mac? He's in the bathroom. Well, that's not gonna work. I mean, we can't It's fine, just go, let's go. He's in the bathroom. He's in the bathroom. Charlie, it's not we can't I mean, it's Oh, shit! Rog, I'm out of bullets! You are? Oh, I'm out of bullets, too, Riggs. Oh, no! Time to kiss L.A. good-bye, suckers! 'Cause tonight the forecast calls for rain! Riggs, there's a basketball right there. You should use it. I know. Wha Oh! Oh, shit, Rog. If you make this shot, you will have redeemed yourself with the item that you failed with in the beginning. That is right. I can do it, Riggs. Ho-ho-ho-ho. In your face, sucker. Yeah, buddy, you did it! You did exactly what you said you were gonna do, and now he's dead. And now we have to kill that shaman woman so that she doesn't come back and reanimate him again. Wait. I got a better idea first. What is it? Let me just show you, man, will you? We don't have to say everything, man. Shit. You know you always have my blessin', partner. That's my partner right there. Yeah. And that's a callback. From the beginning-- so it's come full circle. We know. And then we brought you back from the dead. Well, the shaman did it. And then we killed her. Because we didn't want her to bring back Lazarus. Okay. We get it. Go ahead. Kiss her. Kiss her. Kiss her, man. Yeah. Come on, man. One last thing, in case I die. Oh, my God! Oh! S-So again, this is what we were trying to avoid by coming to you in the first place.                     Hey-o! What is up, bitches? I'm trying to revamp my MySpace page, but Dennis keeps criticizing
 every move that I make.
 What is that?
 What in the hell is a MySpace page?
 It's, like, that friends forum. These things are pretty awesome. You create a profile, put your picture on there other people send you pictures and want to be your friend. Oh. So that's the saddest thing I've ever heard. You guys are losers. How are we losers, dude? Well, maybe it boils down to this, smart guy. Computers are for losers. You're drinking a beer at 8:00 in the morning.
 Whatever, dude. Irrelevant.
 Holy shit! This guy's been trying to contact me for, like, two weeks now and I've just been blowing him off.
 But he's saying that he's our dad.
 Awesome. Crazy person.
 Let me see.
 No. Not awesome. Because look at the pictures he's sending.
 Oh! Oh, look at that!
 See? That's your mom, dude! There's, like There's, like, a ton of pictures of this guy and your mom. Oh, you know what? He does kind of look like you, Dennis. Don't jump to any conclusions here. This is bullshit! You guys have two dads, and I don't even have one. Yeah! That is bullshit! We don't even have one. Wh-What are you talking about? You have a father. Yeah. But he's in prison. He's been there my whole life. It doesn't count. That does count! I never met my father! Take it easy, all right? This guy's not our dad. I don't know. This is really freaking me out. Look, Dee, this guy can't be our dad. That's ridiculous. Is it? Is it any more ridiculous than our dad having brown eyes black hair and being 4'10"? This is really a nice place. It's about time you kids show me some respect. It doesn't really have anything to do with respect. We just wanted to take you to a fancy place so that you would behave yourself.
 Yeah, yeah.
 We need to talk to you about something, Dad.
 Shoot.
 It's kind of disturbing. You two aren't banging, are you?
 What?
 No! What are you talking about?
 That's disgusting.
 Yeah. Yeah, it is. Stay away from that kind of thing. No good can come of it. Trust me.
 That's not what we're here to talk about.
 It better not be because I don't want no grandkids.
 I am not banging my sister.
 Jesus Christ! What have I walked into here?
 Oh, my God.
 You two aren't having sex together?
 No, we're not having sex together.
 What the hell is she doing here?
 Sit down, please, Mom. Sit.
 I am not getting pulled into any sort of perverted sex talk.
 It's not perverted.
 Banging your sister is perverted, Dennis. I am not banging my sister! God!
 Can you just sit, please?
 Please sit in the chair. Please sit in the chair.
 Frank.
 Barbara. Your turkey neck is looking exceptionally attractive this evening.
 You have turned into a retarded person.
 You're a retard. Can we use some adult language, just for a couple minutes? Let's get to it. There's this guy Bruce who contacted Dee on MySpace and he's claiming to be our biological father. We just wanted to ask the question and just get it out of the way. Is there a chance that that could be possible?
 No.
 Yes.
 What?
 Well, Bruce who? Bruce Mathis?
 Yeah.
 Then, yes.
 There's a chance this guy could be our father?
 No. Yes, he is your father. What the hell are you talking about? Do we really have to get into all of this?
 My God! Yes.
 Yes, we really have to get into all this! Everybody settle down. It's not the end of the world. A long time ago, I met Bruce and we had this little affair, or whatever you want to call it. Long story short, he got me pregnant, and I had to make a decision. Seeing as he had no money, I decided that the best thing for everyone was if I didn't tell Bruce and let your father think that the twins were his. End of story. End of story? How could you do that? Oh, I'm sorry. Would you rather I had them aborted?
 Children, would you like to have been aborted?
 I can't believe this. I just can't believe this!
 Okay, Dad. Keep your voice down.
 You whore!
 Keep it down, okay?
 Please don't make a scene.
 Don't make a scene.
 Sit back down. Oh, no! I'm not gonna make a scene! I was just told, excuse me that my horrible, whore wife has tricked me into raising two bastards for 30 years, and I'm being asked to not make a scene! Whoa! Oh, excuse me? Oh, did you bang my wife? Huh? Did you bang my whore wife? Does anybody here have any illegitimate children with my whore wife
 that I should know about?
 Jesus, Frank! Jesus! Jesus, Frank! Jesus, Frank! Jesus, Frank! Jesus, Frank! Jes Oh! Jesus, Frank! My life is a lie! My life is a lie! Somebody's got to get stabbed! Somebody's got to get sta
 No
 Sta Sta Let's get out of here. So, Dad. Kind of a funny story. Turns out my friends got some weird news the other day about their biological father and it got me to thinking, uh, about maybe, you know, reconnecting with mine. Uh-huh. And, you know, Charlie never had a father. And, uh, I thought that maybe the three of us could all become, like like, friends or something. Really? Well, okay. I'll tell you what. Maybe I got something for you.
 It's a father-son type of thing, huh?
 Yeah. You see, I got a little business I been running in here the last couple of years. I was thinking of expanding, and I'm gonna need some people on the outside. Some really badass, tough guys. I like where you're going with this. I think you came to the right place. What do you guys know about smuggling heroin through your anus? You definitely look good. That's not what I'm saying.
 I just think you need to tuck it in in the back.
 In the back? Yeah. You button the top button and then they tuck it in in the back.
 It is tucked in the back.
 Is it?
 Is it bunchy?
 It's not bunchy.
 Let me see. That's exactly it.
 How do I look?
 That's gonna impress your dad, right?
 It is gonna impress my dad. You piece of shit! You no-good piece of shit! Whoa, whoa, Frank! What's going on in here? What happened?
 I had a minor stroke. No big deal.
 What's with the gun, dude? I'm trying to find the son of a bitch who fathered my children.
 What? By doing MySpace?
 Yeah. And I did everything they said to do. I put a picture, a profile. The thing won't tell me where the bastard lives. Did you send him a friend request? I don't want to be his friend. I want to shoot him in the face. Can you help me?
 No. You
 Yes, absolutely. But no killing.
 Needs to be killed.
 Doesn't need to be killed. He could take a good ass whupping. And we're down with that.
 Are you crazy?
 No, dude!
 Give us one second here.
 Charlie. This is our opportunity to prove to people that we are to be respected.
 No one is more respected than dudes in prison, right?
 Yeah. And what are dudes in prison?
 Hard?
 Right. This is our chance to get hard. Okay. I just don't know if this is the best way to get hard. Of course it is. This is totally hard.
 You want to get hard, don't you?
 I want to get hard.
 I want to get very, very hard.
 Do you want to shove heroin into your ass? I don't want to shove anything in my ass. This is the perfect opportunity to prove how hard we are and not shove anything into our asses! What in God's name are you two talking about?
 Frank, we're in.
 Great. Oh, God! This is so weird. I'm really nervous. I really hope he's not an asshole. I don't think I can handle two asshole dads. Are these my beautiful children? I just I can't believe what a miracle this is after all these years. Oops. You know, I loved your mother more than I can say. And I'm sure she had her reasons, but she never told me.
 Yeah. Well, this whole thing is very strange for all of us.
 Yeah.
 We've got a lot to catch up on.
 Yeah. Tell us about yourself.
 Yeah.
 Where to begin, uh I met your mom here in, uh in Philadelphia. It was just before I shipped off to Alaska with Greenpeace.
 I do a lot of environmental work and work with kids.
 Mm-hmm. And we were in Alaska. And then we went to Africa, to the Sudan. We Here. This This is my adopted family.
 Oh.
 You adopted them?
 Yup. In fact, um
 Huh. Hello. Those are your brothers and sisters. Your family just got a little bigger today.
 It sure It sure did.
 You want to know their names? No. We'll do that later. We'll do that later because it's it's hard to remember.
 Okay, thank you very much.
 And anything here, at all times, is yours. Anything in my life is yours.
 These are cool speakers.
 Yep. They're yours. Take 'em. Take 'em.
 No, no. I was kidding.
 It was just a joke, I think. But if you want them, just Uh Africa.
 Yes. Yes, Africa.
 Right? Sudan. I went from the Sudan I was in Darfur. We had a water-purification program there. So much work to be done there. And then I-I I spent a little time in Afghanistan. We were doing a literacy program for women who were resisting the Taliban. Well, for better or worse, I came back here a couple of years ago. And I think it was for better, 'cause I'm doing this work uh, starting some programs for Sacred Cross Hospital, which I think is very promising. And ah! My story is boring. L What about you? What are your passions? You know, what are you doing with your lives? There's been a lot of
 Oh, so many things we do.
 Phases.
 Oh, God. Where do you begin?
 Yeah.
 Something like
 I know. I know. It's
 A lot of different
 Chapters.
 Kinds of kinds of things.
 I want to hear anyth
 Just tell me chapter one.
 Well, a lot of this kind of stuff, right here.
 Yeah.
 These guys.
 A lot of
 These guys are important to us. I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Son of a piece of shit! Hey, you gotta relax there, Frank. Seriously, bro. You're gonna have another stroke. He won't make me his friend. How am I gonna find him if he won't make me his friend?
 Be patient. It's a process.
 Yeah, bro. Come on. It's been days. I got no friends.
 Stop saying that. You have friends.
 I got you. I got this guy Tom. And that crazy woman who claims we had a one-night stand 30 years ago. Right, yeah. Tom doesn't really count though. He kind of, like, comes with it. Screw this! I'm gonna just follow Dennis and Dee around. Sooner or later, they're gonna bump into this bastard. And we're gonna just jump him and beat him over the head with a baseball bat! Frank, come on. They're gonna see that coming a mile away.
 Man, we need to be more devious, more cunning!
 Uh, that's not very hard. That's some weak ass-buster shit, bro. This bastard destroyed my lineage. He must be smashed. We're gonna smash him, friend. We're gonna smash him good. We know people. Look, Frank, uh, we know a guy on the inside we can talk to. He might be willing to help us out with the situation here. You guys are fast. I'm proud of you.
 Thanks, Dad.
 Okay. Now, here's how it's gonna work. I'll have a guy meet you in the bathroom in about 10 minutes. Now he doesn't mind sifting through the feces, so don't hold back. Uh, yeah, here's the thing about that, Dad. We don't have anything in our butts. No. We don't have anything in our butts. We're working on that.
 But we're still hard.
 Yeah. Oh, you should see how hard we're getting. Oh, we are getting so hard. It's, like Whew!
 We actually came by 'cause we need your help.
 Yeah. Let me get this straight. You come to me empty-handed and you want my help? Yeah. And, look, we are really, really sorry about that, Dad. But if you could give us some advice on how to handle a certain situation then we promise we will come back with our butts filled. Oh, so filled. So filled for you. We need to find our friends' father so that we can give him a serious beating. Oh, we're gonna kick the crap out of this guy. And check it out. We can't find him. All right. All right. Why don't you just follow your friends around for a while? They're bound to contact him at some point. When they do, just jump him. Beat him with a baseball bat.
 That's pretty badass.
 That could work. Now, you listen to me. Do not come back here without anything up those asses! Okay? Okay. Thank you! Thank you. Thank you, Philadelphia. TheJuvenile Lupus Association thanks you, and the children thank you.
 Oh, saving the kids, huh?
 Yeah, I guess. Those little angels, they're the future. That's my dad up there. He put this whole shindig together.
 Really?
 Oh, yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean, I helped, of course. I mean, this whole lupus nightmare has gone on long enough
 you know?
 Yeah. Ladies and gentlemen, sometimes a father has the privilege of playing a little music with his daughter. Would you please welcome Deandra Reynolds? Juvenile Lupus Association. What a bunch of bullshit.
 Mac, I got one question for you.
 What?
 What's the plan again?
 Are you kidding me? I swear, Charlie, you're, like, a retard. What we're gonna do is we're gonna bash him with the bat when he comes out.
 You want to huff some of this glue with me?
 No! Put the glue away!
 Please. Huff a little with me, dude.
 All right, fine.
 Fine!
 We just need to keep an edge. We got to stay hard, dude, because you can't do it if This is Elmer's glue, for Christ sakes, Charlie!
 Do you have the camera?
 Yeah, I got the camera!
 I just don't know what it's for, Mac!
 I'm gonna bash you with this! When he comes out, I'm gonna smash his face. You're gonna take a picture. We're gonna show it to my dad
 Show it to your dad.
 To prove how hard we are! Whoo!
 Oww!
 Whoo! No, dude. We shouldn't do this. I'm backing out. You can't back out. Frank is waiting in the car.
 He's gonna be pissed if we don't finish the job.
 Let Frank wait in the car. We owe this to him. This guy banged Frank's wife.
 So did you.
 Yeah, but it's different.
 How is that different?
 I don't know, Charlie! Focus! There they are. Just relax, dude. He's hugging them. They're hugging him back!
 This is crazy. We shouldn't do this.
 We should bash all three. This is it. Let's go. You ready? Don't be a pussy.
 Let's go.
 Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh. Hi. Hi.
 Can I help you?
 Can I help you? Can I help you? Can I help you? Uh, okay. Um It's It's okay. It's okay. I got it. Have a good night. What the hell was that shit? What did you do?
 I freaked out.
 You totally freaked out! You just left me
 I was gonna hit him.
 You left me standing there. I took a picture of the guy.
 Hey!
 What?
 Snap out of it! Okay?
 Okay! Yes.
 Now we got to think of something to tell Frank.
 Okay.
 Hey! Look at me.
 Yeah? Ow!
 Let's tell him the truth.
 Let's tell him the truth.
 Blood! Blood! There's so much blood!
 What happened?
 We bashed him good!
 We bashed him so good!
 We bashed him good!
 I think we killed him. Drive! Drive! Drive! Jesus, children! This isn't exactly what Mommy needs right now. No. No, no, no. Mom, Bruce is so awesome. He
 We had the best time last night.
 Bruce is the coolest.
 We went to this lupus event last night. Lupus is awesome!
 Amazing.
 You should give Bruce another chance.
 Barbara.
 My God. You still look amazing.
 Wow. The years have treated you well. I would have thought living in poverty for a quarter of a century would have taken its toll. Well, when Father died, I was left with all that money. There's only so much you can give away before you finally realize it's okay to spend a little on yourself.
 On you.
 Yeah, on me. Father? Wealthy? I never knew. I guess it never came up. So you guys ready? I am! I'm up for anything. Okay. But first things first.
 Oh.
 Yeah. Let's just put these on. One for you. One for me. Great. Okay, let's go spread somejoy. Right. Uh Ooh. Okay. Um, hey. Hey, pal. How How you feeling? It hurts everywhere.
 Well
 Well, it Everything's gonna be okay.
 You don't know that, Deandra.
 Shut up, Mother. I don't think we should be lying to the sick children.
 I was trying to be encouraging.
 What if he doesn't get better? You're gonna look like a fool. I gotta say I agree with Dee. The kid's gonna die anyway. What difference does it make? I can hear you. Oh, you heard Well, you know what? Disregard that.
 Yeah. You know, we weren't even talking about you.
 No. No. We were talking about your sick and dying friend in the next bed. Mother! What are you doing?
 Nothing!
 Oh, my God!
 You can't steal the children's medication.
 I'm not.
 Let me see in your purse! Open your purse up!
 Don't be ridiculous!
 Really?
 Everything okay over here?
 Yes.
 A slight glitch here.
 Um, this is really kind of bumming me out here.
 Yeah, this is not fun. Yes. I'm not exactly sure what it is we're trying to prove. We're not trying to prove anything. We're just helping the kids.
 Who are we really helping?
 Yeah? I'm not sure I understand what you mean. Well, listen, it's one thing to rock out, raise some cash. But it's a totally different thing to put our lives at risk. Oh, yeah. I mean, there's all these diseases floating around in here. Yes. I mean, how can we help anyone if we're all getting sick?
 I mean, use your head.
 Plus, it's freezing in here. You think you could talk to somebody about cranking the heat up a little?
 This isn't good for us.
 You're not serious? I don't think it's a lot to ask to have them turn the temperature up. It's easy. You just push a button or, like, crank a thing over.
 Are you guys getting hungry?
 Oh, yes.
 I am starving.
 Yeah, I could eat.
 Is there a cafeteria in the hospital?
 No, come on. Gross.
 I'm not eating in a hospital cafeteria.
 That's a good point. Brucie, do you know a nice restaurant in the area? I'm gonna want those noses back. Please. Give it a rest with that martyr nonsense.
 Yeah. Who is he? Patch Adams?
 You know who never acts like he cares about kids?
 Dad.
 Dad. All right, buddy. Baking soda, lube, balloons. This is how it's gonna go. I'm gonna jam this into your rectum. And then, woo! Like that, it's gonna expand in your colon, okay?
 It's gonna be that big?
 Absolutely. You ready? Drop those pants. Hey, guys. What do you think? That's a good look. That's a good look for you. Where're you headed? I tell you what, I feel like a hundred dollars. Ever since you guys beat that guy up, I got to thinking. Hey, what am I gonna do? Huh? Dive into some kind of depression over this? No. I'm gonna jump right back on the horse. So I contacted that woman on MySpace who claimed that we had a one-night stand. Turns out she's single and ready to go.
 Give me some skin.
 Good work. There you go, Frankie!
 That might be her. Mac, get the door.
 Let me clean this up.
 Hide that balloon.
 That's gonna kill your date.
 Where's my dad?
 So he's your dad now
 Get out of the way.
 Daddy. Don't Daddy me. You blew your chances with this daddy. You're dead to me.
 No. Just listen for a second here, okay?
 No. No. We've had a change of heart. We've decided to forgive you and to allow you to be our father again. I'm not into being your dad anymore. Don't want to be your dad.
 Uh, kinda giving you a second chance here, Dad.
 Daddy, yeah.
 No. I'm over it.
 You can't be over it.
 No, no, no.
 I'm over it.
 He can be over it.
 Will you shut up? What is with you two?
 I am over over over it!
 You're not allowed to be over it! I can yell at him! Shh.
 Charlie?
 Hey, Mom. What What are you doing here?
 I'm confused. Do you live here?
 Yeah.
 Bonnie?
 Frank! How do you guys know each other?
 This is my date.
 Whoa! Wait a second. I thought you were going on a date with a woman you had a one-night stand with 30 years ago.
 Yeah.
 Yeah. So if you guys had a one-night stand You know, I don't know who my father You could be my Dad?                       So he's in the law house, right Oh, please stop talking. Just let me finish my story. Describing an episode of Law and Order in full detail is not a story. No, it's so good. First of all, I think I could be a really good lawyer. I'm better than Sam Waterston, I'll tell you that much. You want to be a lawyer? Don't you think you should know how to read or write? Objection. Hearsay. That's lawyer talk. That's the kind of stuff you have to do. That serial killer killed another woman last night. Really? Yeah. It says here he's targeting young, attractive blondes. Okay, that's it. I'm not closing the bar by myself anymore. Why? What are you worried about? You don't fit the description. I fit the description. No, no. Young, attractive I fit the description. All right. Well, first of all, you're too big, Dee. You're like a You're like a female Larry Bird. There's too much of you. There's not too much of me. He would never finish the job. He'd get the job done. He'd spend his whole night hacking and sawing. Then he still wouldn't be done. He would open his box of tools and say, "What tools am I gonna use for this?" He could use normal tools. He'd look at that pile of bones and flesh and say "How many people have I murdered tonight?" "How is this just one person?" Mm-hmm. Well, guess what. You're Larry Bird. That's okay, 'cause Larry Bird's an excellent player. He's an awesome player. What's up, bitches? Hey yo! Hey. This guy, he got laid last night. What? No, I didn't. Yeah, you did. You didn't come home. Yes, I did. You're wearing the same clothes you were wearing yesterday. That's what you were wearing yesterday. These are different clothes. Where'd you get those scratches on your neck? What? You got scratches on your neck. No, I don't. Oh, let me see. No. What? I gotta take a piss. I don't have any You guys are Huh? Well, that was weird. Wow. He's been acting like that a lot lately. What's gotten into him? Serial killing. If I'm gonna prove that Mac is guilty, I gotta apply a little pressure. I'm gonna get a chain saw. A chain saw? You can't just torture someone 'cause you think they're guilty. Oh, don't give me that liberal bullshit. Mac is not the serial killer. He's not smart enough. He's a dumb person. And dumb people are not capable of serial killing. Oh, yeah? What about the scratches on his neck? I got a hunch about this. You got a hunch? Frank's got a hunch. Let's just convict him. Let's carve our best friend to pieces with a chain saw based on a hunch. Jesus Christ, Frank. Dee, why don't you and I use a little textbook psychology? And that'll lead us to the real serial killer's doorstep. Are you all gonna go against me on this? Sorry, Larry Bird. Stop trying to use the Larry Bird thing. I don't know. Shh. What are you guys talking about? Nothing. Nothing. Okay, I forgot about this thing that I gotta do, take care of. I was thinking about it in the bathroom. And I figured I should just go deal with it now. So I'm just gonna go deal with it now. I guess I'll see you guys later? Okay, bye. Oh, if I prove that he is guilty I am gonna torture the shit out of him. Hey, you. We need to talk. I don't understand. I thought we talked about this. We did. It's just that my friends are getting suspicious. And I cannot have them find out that we are dating again. Why not? Because of your Oh, God. Situation down there. You mean my penis? Well, you don't have to say it out loud. I told you. I'm getting rid of it. I know. But when, dude? I feel like I've been putting a lot of time in here. Soon. It takes time. Look, I know that it takes time. I've been reading up on the subject. But maybe we should just take it easy until then. Because of the penis? Oh, boy. There it is. The penis. Yes. Because of the pen Okay, listen. Here's the deal. I feel like we make out, and it's great. I mean, really great. But then things start to get hot and heavy and you scratch me. Which is cool. But you're really strong, and it hurts. And sometimes just sometimes I bump up against it. And I I just can't handle that. Really? Because you seem like you can handle anything. I mean, with that body. Well. Yeah, I mean, physically, sure. I mean, I guess I can handle pretty much any situation. I mean, I do work out. So You sure do. I don't know. He's been in there a long time. You think he's chopping up bodies? He's not chopping up anything. He's not a serial killer. Hey, man. What'd I tell you about bringing that chain saw? Hey, you want to take a picture with it? No. We're on an invest Do you have a camera? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Absolutely then. Yeah. All right. How's this look? Does this look cool? Hold it closer to your face and look really crazy. Like I'm killing somebody? Let me start it and get my tongue Put your tongue there. There he is. There he is. Oh! We got ourselves a serial killer. No, you don't have anything. That's inconclusive, Frank. Look, look. He's guilty as sin. Look at him. He's sneaking around. You gotta have hard evidence. You don't have any hard evidence. I'll tell you what you do have. You got a camera. So let's snap one off, all right? Okay, like this? Okay, right. Put your tongue closer to the blade. Dennis! Dee. What the hell are you doing? Get outta here. You're gonna blow my cover. This seems extraordinarily dangerous. Dee, that is the point of being here. This is the area of the highest concentration of murders by the serial killer. I know. That's why I feel like a sitting duck out there. You volunteered for this, Sis. If you recall, I didn't want to use you as the bait. You do not fit the profile. I fit the profile, Dennis! That's the right attitude. Now pull these out or something. You need to look sexy for this guy. Otherwise, he's never gonna Come on. I just feel like this is a very inappropriate outfit for how cold it is out here. Is it cold out here? It's freezing! I have a down jacket on, a wool blanket. It's a very toasty situation I got back here. Get back out there, tiger. You can do it. I believe in you. Oh, Mac? Are you in there? We're clear, Charlie. Come on. This is an illegal search, Frank. What's the decorating motif of this place prison cell? I'm pretty sure you need a warrant to be doing this, buddy. What Why are you wearing those gloves? Fingerprints. You think I want some Jew lawyer crawling up my ass in six months? Objection. Extremely racist, man. The guy's innocent, all right? You're poking around but there's no point to it 'cause you're not gonna find anything. Oh! And Bingo was his nameo The Human Anatomy. He's got a half a chapter highlighted on the removal of human genitalia. Hey, Frank, what guy hasn't done some extensive research on his own genitalia? All right? Don't say "you," buddy, because I woke up to you doing some pretty frantic research last night, pal. We could go tit for tat on that one. So you better drop that subject. All I'm saying is that the book doesn't mean anything. You got no evidence! You got no case, Frank. It stinks, that stuff. This stuff is Drakkar Noir, man. Damn, girl. Who you with? Oh. I think you got the wrong idea. I'm not with anybody. Word? Well, lookee here. Maybe if you get up off that crack rock, you can come and be Pepper Jacks best ho. Oh, no. I'm not on any crack rock. I mean, one Okay, one time I was hooked on the crack rock. But that was because I was trying to get on welfare and fail a drug test. But that stuff, you gotta be careful because it'll mess you. Why are you asking? Do you have some on you? Hi. Uh, sir, I'm sorry. We're trying to conduct a little business here. Ho. Pepper Jacks trying to conduct some business here too. You with this cracker? No. Well, technically, we drove here together. But I'm not with anybody. You heard it. Your bitch chose me. See now, Pepper Jack, I feel like we're miscommunication. Bitch, you speak when spoken to now. Oh, no. No. Sir, you know what? We're just gonna get out of here. Dee, let's go. Whoa. Now you're not just gonna come here and take Pepper Jacks best ho. You want this ho back, Pepper Jack needs to get paid. Pepper Jack, are you serious? Do Pepper Jack look like he playing? I don't think Pepper Jacks playing. I feel like Pepper Jack isn't playing either. No, Pepper Jack is not playing. In fact, Pepper Jack about to cut somebody. Oh, please don't cut. Oh, no cutting. That's not necessary. All right, how much? Well, what you got? I don't know. Seven bucks and a stupid thermos. Is that Fraggle Rock? Yeah. Oh, Pepper Jack love Fraggle Rock. Listen, I feel like we've been going about this the wrong way. I mean, you can't just jump into the mind of a serial killer. I feel like you need to walk in his shoes. Right. We need to go deeper. We need to eat, breathe and sleep serial killer. Go through all of the steps that this guy would in order to understand his thoughts. Yeah. Okay, what's the first step? Here's what I think. If I was gonna start mass murdering people I feel like the first thing I would do is pick a victim. Right. We need a victim. We need to find somebody who we would want to kill. Mm-hmm. But who? Here you go, Dee. Thanks. And shithead. Hope you burn your tongue. Sit down. No. What the hell is wrong with you? What is wrong with me? What the hell is wrong with you? I saw you last night! You did? So you admit it? Yeah. Don't ever admit it, Mac! Don't ever admit it! It makes my job that much harder. All right, look. You gotta quit this thing, buddy. I tried, dude. I tried. But it's like a drug. I just get wrapped up in the moment and boom, it just happens. I don't care what your sick and twisted reasons are. I don't want to hear it. Who else knows about this? Nobody. Just her. Well, that's good. She won't be a problem. She ain't gonna tell anybody. But I gotta tell you, buddy. Frank's onto you. Frank knows? Well, he's sniffing around. Oh, goddamn it. When the time is right, he's gonna come at you, and he's gonna come at you hard! Here's what you gotta do. You gotta deny. Deny. Just deny it. Just deny it. Deny, deny, deny, deny. You just deny it. Deny it to the end. If you deny something, it means it never happened. It never happened. You gotta promise me something here, buddy. Uhhuh? You gotta stop. Well, okay. That's gonna be a little bit of an issue, man. I don't know if I can promise that. Are you serious? I want to stop. I just Okay. Hey, man. Hey, hey. Shh, shh, shh. We're gonna get you the help. All right? But in the meantime, you gotta give me the time to, like, build your case. You know? To To help your defense out. Like, you know, I gotta do my thing. And then And then I do some moves. Yeah. I'm into it. Okay. Yeah, all right. What the hell does that have anything to do with what we're talking about? Lawyer stuff. It's a great show. Are you gonna help me? Yeah, man. Are you wearing my Drakkar? Ooh, ooh, ooh. Accusations. Well, it's just Those are no good. It's my favorite I'm telling you, Dee, this is a bad idea. No. We need killing tools. But you're not using your head. This is serial killing 101. You don't buy anything that can be traced back to you. We're not buying anything. My neighbor Gary works here. He is desperately in love with me. We need killing tools, he needs me to smile at him every once in a while. We're gonna take whatever we want for free. There's gonna be no paper trail. That works. I wonder if they have painter's overalls. How come? Well, my guy's a painter. I go from house to house gaining very easy access to my victims. And more importantly, gaining their trust. Uhhuh. Who's your guy? Psycho clown. Psycho clown? Yeah. I like to dress like a clown when I slaughter. Now help me grab some killing tools. The serial killer's probably not a psycho clown, Dee. Whoa. What do you think of these gardening shears? I like those gardening shears very much. But do they cut through bone? Oh, yeah. That's a good question. Hey, Gary. These shears, they do cut through bone, yes? Uh, yeah. I guess. Yeah, I thought so. Gary, my brother and I, we're gonna take these shears. But we're gonna take 'em on the hush-hush. What? For free. Oh, okay. Okay. Get back to work. There you go. Oh, man. That guy's a pussy. Yeah, spineless. Hello. Messy. Too messy. Very messy. Do you mind if my associate and I ask you a couple questions? Don't feel compelled to answer any of them, Mrs. Mac. I will be recording this conversation. You want a fresh cigarette? Here, here. Yeah. I notice you like cherry pie. Cut the chitchat. My client's clearly a busy woman. Ask your questions. In your opinion, ma'am, was your son an angry child? Objection. Leading. Did he ever exhibit any hatred toward women? Irrelevant questioning. Do you think he was raised in a dysfunctional family? Move to strike. Wait a minute. What are you talking about? Ask her fair questions! I'll give you one question, and then we're out of here! One question. You think your son's out there killing people? Yeah. Oh! That's it, lady! Damn it! You just buried me! Chain saw serial killer. You buried me. That's my whole case! I'll be in touch. I can't believe you actually dressed like a clown. You're gonna draw so much attention. I thought we were getting into the killer's shoes. But the killer's not a psycho clown, Dee. That's only in movies stupid ones. Oh, really? John Wayne Gacy? He was a psycho clown. He was an excellent one. Did good work. Come on, Dee, that's Yeah, actually, you're right. He was pretty Okay, okay. Here she comes. This is the fun part, Dee. This is the part that we've been working up to. This is what all the work has been for. We're gonna follow our victim. Uhhuh. And then we're gonna jump her. And then I'm gonna strangle her and you're gonna chop her into pieces. Okay, but what are we really gonna do? Huh? We're not really gonna kill her. What are we gonna do? Oh, yeah. Oh, shit. That's a bummer. Yeah, you're right. Let's just follow her for a little. We'll throw a good scare into her. Figure out what to do later. That's just not as much fun as actually No. No. I know. It's good enough. Let's do this. Okay. Oh, my God. My eyes feel like fire. Dee, if you hadn't been squeaking around like a goddamn psycho clown she never would've noticed us. No, this is not my fault. Everything we do is backfiring. We need a new plan. No shit, Sis. But what's the plan? What? We need a confession. What the hell are you doing? I'm spying. I'm spying on everybody. And I got good news. I know the killer is Mac. I got hard evidence. I got a confession from his mother. Holy shit, Dee. You know what? I just realized something. What? I know who the killer is. You do? Yes. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Dee, the real serial killer is Mac. That's what I just said. How did we not see it earlier? I don't know. Whatever! I got a plan. We gotta set a trap. We're gonna get a confession. But first, we gotta lure him in on the phone. Hold that thought, Frank. I just came up with a plan. Uhhuh. We need to set a trap and get a confession from him. Ooh, but first, we gotta lure him in on the phone. Yes! Are you shitting me? Now, Dee, can you do a girl's voice? Well, this was fun. Right? Mm-hmm. Now I'm gonna go. Uh, same time tomorrow? Well, maybe we could go out or something. You know, to a restaurant. Or Or to your bar. Ooh. Ooh, ooh, ooh. Yeah, that's not gonna work. I'm getting tired of this. I feel like you're afraid that people will see us together. No. I don't care if people see us together. I just don't want them to think that we're dating. We are dating! I don't think it's too much to ask for you to keep this quiet, considering your condition. Look, it's not like I'm ashamed of you. I'm ashamed of myself. Well, it's over. I don't know what happened, man, but it's over. What's over? Did you go back? Of course I went back, Charlie. Damn it, Mac. I told you not to go back. You're digging me a pretty big hole here! It doesn't matter, because she won't talk to me anymore, dude. Well, that's very interesting. She talks When did you start hearing voices? That could actually help us. What's the I. D? Private. Should I answer it? Yeah. I'll allow it. Go, go, go. Uh, hello? Uh, okay. Uh, could you hold on one second? Some chick named Sandy. She said we met at the bar the other night. Speakerphone. Can you do it on speakerphone for this? Yeah. Okay. Hey, Sandy. Uh, what's crackin'? This is Mac, right? Good-looking guy, great sense of humor, really bulky? Uh, more ripped. Strike that. Jacked. Irrelevant. Toned. Exaggeration. I work out. I'll allow it. Okay. Yeah, that's me. Listen. I was thinking maybe you should come over to my place tonight. There's no one here. I'm all alone. Could you come take care of me? I'll allow it. Uh, yeah. Yeah, I can take care of you. Great. Then I'll see you at my place. Great. I'll see you tonight. I'll allow it. We got him. Let's get the video camera and get the hell outta here. Where are we going? To catch a predator. Whose apartment is this? My friend Gary's. Gary the hardware store guy? Yeah. He's, like, never here. Why do you have his keys? 'Cause he asked me to water his plants when he's out of town. All of his plants are dead. Well, I don't do it. I'm gonna go oil my chain saw. What? Frank, we don't need the chain saw. Is that what's in that bag? Oh, we do. Because drawing a confession out of someone is like doing a beautiful dance a beautiful dance with a chain saw. He makes less and less sense as the days go by. I don't get it at all. All right, let's set up. Yep. Gettin' laid tonight. "Come on in. I am horny. " Giddyap. Hello? Sandy? Hey, come on in. Have a seat. I made you some cookies. I'm just in here changing into my bikini. Really? Can I come back? Uhuh. Oh. Got the wine coolers. Yummy. Did you bring any condoms? Ooh, not really into the whole condom thing. So Hello, Mac. How are you? What are you doing, dude? Why don't you have a seat, enjoy a cookie, have some iced tea. Okay. Who are you here to see? My friend Sandy. Oh, Sandy. Sandy, huh? Is Sandy a young, attractive, blonde girl? I have no idea. Uh, Sandy. Why don't you come out here, please? Oh. Why hello, Mac. Not so young and attractive, is she? What? Must be a big disappointment. What is going on here? What were you planning on doing to Sandy? What do you think, dude? Well, according to this phone transcript, Mac you were going to "take care of her"? Yeah. Take care of her. The Human Anatomy. How about a little light reading? What are you doing with my book? You know where I got it, Mac. Tie him up! Come on, Frank. Tie me up? Jesus Christ! Get the camera away from me! Before you go, I should tell you I'm I'm sorry, Mac. You can't keep running from this thing. You gotta face this head on! I'm gonna get you off this. Don't be afraid to show me your ugly side. All right. Put that away, Frank. You don't need a chain saw. You're talking to an innocent man. All right, Mac. I'm gonna ask you now 'cause I'm tired and hungry. I want to go home. I want to wash my hands of this whole stinking mess. Did you or did you not snap into an alternate and distinct personality causing you to go on a serial killing rampage? What? No. What? Yes, you did. You All right, Mac. You're crazy, right? You're a crazy person. Sometimes you're two people. Let's see the other guy. Let him out. Let who out? The serial killer, Mac! Let the serial killer out! I'm not a serial killer! Then why all the shady behavior? I've been banging the tranny! I didn't want you guys to find out. No. You're trying to What? Ew. Oh. I don't even know how that works. It's complicated. There's a lot She tapes it back. Oh, really? Come on, man. Oh, my God, man. I've been reading up and Wait, wait, wait. Dude, wait. So you're not the serial killer? No. I just won this case. That means you're a free man. You're not a serial killer. See, when I came in And I was doing You guys don't even get it, do you? I'm gonna get a beer. Dee, do you think this guy's got any beer in his fridge? No. There's a bunch of severed heads in there. What? There's about 15 severed heads in there, I'd say. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's heads in there. There's a lot of heads in there. A shitload of heads. We're in the killer's apartment? Yes! Neighbor Gary? Gary. Oh, my God. I don't know who Gary is. Wait. Shh, shh, shh. I think I hear keys. What are you people doing in my apartment?                       minutes. Keep going, buddy. Frank, you seeing this? I'm working on the chicken parts over here. Forget the chicken parts. Charlie is about to shatter the world record for holding his breath he's up to seven minutes. Take the buns off the radiator. Forget the buns. We are gonna be world famous after this. Charlie, how you doing? I gotta breathe, man. No, Charlie, don't breathe! One more minute! Buns are gonna burn! Don't do that! Ohh! Ohh! Ohh! Come on! Are you breathing? Of course I'm breathing! Well, you ruined it. We could have been famous. We could have been famous. Come in! Hi. I Oh, I'm, uh What do you want, lady? Ow! Uh, my name is Betty Canuso, and I don't know if you heard but a week ago, Eastern State Correctional Facility was forced to release due to overcrowding. Eastern State? That's where my dad is. Maybe they let my dad out. Did they let my dad out? How would I know that? Listen, I'm here because of a man named Wendell Albright, a registered sex offender. He's moved into this neighborhood. Yeah. I'm hoping by raising awareness we can force him out of the neighborhood and away from our children, you know, once and for all. It's going on and on. Is there something that you need from us? Because we're in the middle of something. Please post these flyers anywhere you can. Okay, okay, okay. Yes, yes, yes. All right. Okay. Thank you for your time. Out. Get out. Get out. Some people have no sense of my personal boundaries and property. Let's set the shit up again. Holy shit! What? This dude looks just like Dennis. I do not look like this guy. Are you serious, dude? What are you guys talking about? He's, like, 40 years old. Oh, my God. Look at his jaw. Look at his jawline. His jaw is exactly where I don't look like him. His jaw is fat and it's Go, like, this far back. I never go that far back. When I do, it doesn't do that. I give you six to eight months before you start looking exactly like that guy. That's crazy, man. There's no resemblance Hello. Dad. They did let you out. Oh, my God. Don't touch me. Right. That's how it goes. Hey, hey, come meet my friends. Guys, this is my dad. Well, Charlie you know. Hey, hey, man. Hey, by the way real sorry about that whole heroin incident in the butt, but here's the deal. I had my butt filled like a Christmas stocking, and I wanted to come I got a little nervous, everything came flushing out of me. Wendell "Shorteyes." They let you out too, huh? What? No, I'm not Wendell "Shorteyes. " Didn't I stab you once? No, you never stabbed Look, I'm not Wendell, okay? I'm not a sexual child molester. I'm Dennis Reynolds. I'm handsome and chiseled and Now you got me thinking. I gotta go look in a mirror. Dad, what are you gonna do now that you're out? I need a job. Well, tell you what. I just got an idea. Bouncer. Welcome aboard, buddy. Right. Good thinking. Can I talk to you for a second, you guys? Oh, yeah. Dude, Dee, that guy really likes your hair. Yeah, he does. This is a very bad plan. What? Which one? This man should not work here. Why are you attacking us? This guy looks like he wants to eat me. Has he ever eaten anybody that you know of? I don't think so. No. But it'd be pretty cool if he did. Yeah, that is really cool. Think about the dedication you got to put into eating a human body. If he's got that kind of commitment, imagine what Son, where's the telephone? Do you have plans, Dad? 'Cause I was thinking we could do some father-son stuff. Have a catch. Talk. No, I'm not gonna do that. But I'll tell you what. Here's a list of, uh, all the people I, uh, promised to visit after I got out of prison. Maybe you can drive me around, help me take care of a few of 'em, hmm? Take care of a few of 'em? Okay, that sounds cool. You got a car? No. Dennis does, but he won't give me the keys. That won't be a problem. I do not want Mac's dad working at our bar. I was looking in the mirror, and I gotta tell you, looks pretty good in here. Jawline looks good Are you listening to me? I don't want to get eaten. Eaten? He eats people? That's awesome. That's not awesome. Why do you guys think that eating people is awesome? It just is. Asshole! What? Did you see that? Yeah, I saw that. Listen, I need your help, okay? You're part owner of the bar, and you're probably the only person that Mac listens to and I need you talk to him Dee, you're blowing this completely out of proportion. Mac's dad probably hasn't seen a woman in a very long time. And as soon as he comes across one that's actually attractive he's gonna forget all about you, just like every other man does. Why do you do that? Pervert! Dickhead! Pervert? Dickhead? Why are people yelling at me in the streets, Dee? Could have something to do with that. What? That's gonna be a problem for me. Take the TV too. Frank! What the hell's going on in here, man? I'm leaving. It's been great, but I got to get something more out of my life. Well, why are you taking all my shit? Well, it was really hard to tell whose was whose, so I just decided to take everything. You don't ever use this. I use that all the time. It's like the only thing I use. All right, slow down, Frank. Slow down. What the hell's this all about? Charlie, I need a woman. I need a woman to cook for me and clean up after me and somebody who'll do everything I say. That's just a maid. You want a maid? Yeah. That's right. A maid. A maid I can bang. Well, what the hell, man? I mean What? I thought we had a pretty sweet thing going on here. Am I wrong? We had a good deal going on. We hung out. We Breakin' records, eatin' chicken scraps. I know you're gonna miss me. Don't hug me! Get Get out of my apartment. Dude, I don't need you. No, wait, wait. You know what, dude? Before you go, remember one thing. We had about the sweetest life that two men can have together, and you're walking out on that. Charlie, you're gonna have to deal with it. You know why? Because I need that bang maid. All right. But you're not gonna do very well out there without this guy. 'Cause I may not be much, Frank, but, uh, I think you'll find that I'm a pretty sweet deal once you're out there on your own, and I'll tell you what else. You're not gonna find a bang maid, 'cause there's no such thing. I already did. Your mom. Goodbye. Okay, let's go. It's been about 30 minutes, Dad. What were you doing up there? Hmm? Oh, just, uh, keeping up with my, uh, correspondence. Oh, that sounds nice. How'd it go? Well, there was a bit of a struggle, but, uh it turned out just fine. Oh, good. Good. So, um Hey, I was thinking we could hang out, you know. I was thinking we could go on a double date. Go onto Match. Com, find us a couple of hot ladies. What do you think? No. No. Okay. Ooh! We could go on a road trip. Hey, Dad, let's go to Cooperstown, New York. I have always wanted to go to the Baseball Hall of Fame with my dad. Do you want to do that with me, Dad? Start the car. Okay. I'll start the car. That's fine. Um, just school me again here. Is it the yellow one to the black one, or is there orange involved? Red. Red. Just red. There we go. Teamwork, right? A little father-son teamwork. Okay, here we go. Put on your seat belt. Or don't. Here we go. It looks great. Stop fiddling with it. I know it looks great. I just want to make sure the glue holds. Remember, this is a twofold operation. We want to prove that you're not Wendell Albright but prove that you are a good guy. Good guy? Check. That comes naturally for me. Great. Now step one. This guy's a little paunchy, right? You're not. You got a great body. But how are we supposed to see that with this billowy shirt you got on? Pop that thing off. Whoa. Wait a second, Dee. I can't just pop my shirt off in the middle of a park. You crazy? I feel like you're not using your head. What better way to differentiate you from this fatty than by showing off this amazing body? There is an amazing body under this shirt. I'm gonna pop the shirt off. I need to show it. This is what I'm thinking. You go over there and put on a fitness clinic for these kids. Show that you care about their physical body. I care about the kids. I would never hurt the kids, but I care about them. Absolutely. I'm gonna go do that right now. Take a lap. Work those monkey bars. Hey, fellas. Hi, there. I am working with a program that assimilates convicted child molesters right back into your neighborhood. Kids, how you doing today?

Now that you and my mother are opening a dialogue here I don't know if you've taken any time out of your dinner to notice her ample breasts. What? Charlie. The man's been in prison a long time. He probably needs a woman. What you may or may not have known Is my mother happens to be one hell of a whore of a man-stealing woman! Charlie, that's just rude. What are you doing, Charlie? It's okay, because my dad already has a woman, Frank. Uh, you have Mom. She hates me. That's not true. That's not true. Mom, you don't hate Dad, do you? Oh, yeah. Damn it. Mother, I don't know if you know this or not but Luther happens to be a very successful drug dealer. Oh. This might appeal to the whore in you.

This isn't about them Charlie or Mac or anyone else this is about you and me, bro. This is about dudes living together, hanging out, sharing their bed and their life No. That's not what this is about! Yes!

I think he's killing those people. Charlie. Holy shit! He's killing He's probably eating them too, dude. And although I think eating people is very cool, not if we're involved. No, Charlie, he is not killing anybody, okay? We're accomplices. No, we are not. He told me these are people from his past, and he's got to take care of them. And once he takes care of them, he's gonna take care of me. Oh, my God! Wait, that doesn't sound good. No, that doesn't sound good at all for you, bro. I'm on the list, of course, and then Uhoh.

Of course he memorized it. That's pointless. Okay, I What's this about? Why am I on the list? Charlie It's the heroin thing. Remember when he asked us to put heroin in our butts Yes. And smuggle it into prison and we didn't do it? Now he's all hot and bothered 'cause we don't give him heroin? We don't put it in our butts? You don't do that!

You've been driving around in my car? Uh, my dad made me steal it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, dude. That son of a bitch. He's a dangerous man, and I don't want him in the bar anymore. Okay.

Officer. Officer, we know everything. What are you talking about? We're the ones that called you. That's my dad you're arresting. He's been killing all the people on this list. Oh, yeah. We looked into all that already. He wasn't killing those people. In fact, everybody on that list spoke very highly of him. Spoke highly of him? What? Yeah. Apparently, he was making amends with all the people he wronged. Then if he hasn't been killing anybody, why are you arresting him? Because he violated his parole. He's not supposed to leave the state and we caught him buying three airline tickets. To where? Cooperstown, New York. Said he was gonna take some guy named Mac and some guy named Charlie. Oh. You guys have a good one, huh? Yeah. Oh, my God. Dad. Dad! Dad, you did want to take me to the Hall of Fame. Well, I wanted it to be a surprise. It is a surprise. It's a huge surprise, Dad.

This thing is disgusting. There's so much rust. Maybe we should wipe it with a wet rag. I'm not gonna do that! Why not? Because it's a goddamn circuit breaker, Mac. We'll get electrocuted. No, I'm just gonna use this screwdriver, all right? It's got a rubber handle. That'll keep me grounded. No, I'm pretty sure you have to be standing on rubber. Well, the bottoms of my shoes are rubber. Oh, no! You know what it is? You can't be standing on the ground at all. Maybe you should jump up into midair and do it. Hmm? Yeah. If you jump into the air and grab a live wire you won't get electrocuted. But then if you land on the ground and you're still holding that wire you'll be blown to bits. I saw it in Tango and Cash. So I'm supposed to risk my life based on something that you saw in the movie Tango and Cash? Kurt Russell I think All right, I'm gonna jam this thing with a screwdriver. All right? The rubber handle will ground me. And I'll be safe. All right. All right. Give it a shot. Okay. It's all set to scrape Oh, my God! Holy shit! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wh-What the hell are you doing? It exploded. You're making it worse! Bro, you gotta pay somebody to fix this, man. No! I'm tired of spending my money every time something goes wrong in this place. Well, we can't fix it, Frank! It's too dangerous! It scared the shit out of me, man. Well, get Charlie to do it. He won't go near the thing. He's already been electrocuted, like, 500 times. Yeah, man. I think he's starting to catch on to that. Dennis, get me a harness 'cause I'll have to be swinging in the air to do this. Are you kidding me? I told you. Bro, did you get the flashlights? Forget about the flashlights! Check these bad boys out! They fell off the back of a truck. Huh? Nice grab. All right. But what about the flashlights? Uh, I'm sorry. Someone wasn't paying attention, right? Free speakers, dude! Free speakers for the bar! Free speakers! Mac, let's plug these bad boys in. Yeah! We don't have any electricity! That's why we needed the flashlight. Careful! I'm sorry. I didn't Holy shit. What is that? Oh, my God. Whoa. That's a big bag of drugs. This is not good, dude. Somebody's gonna be looking for those drugs. Relax, dude. They're gonna be shit out of luck 'cause no one No one saw us take the speakers. Did they? See us take No. There you have it. Look, let's not worry or panic. This is This is a lot of drugs. But, like, what's the worst that could happen? Gotta get rid of it. Yeah. Drugs are bad news. Let's get rid of it. Throw it in the garbage. Ooh, you can't do that 'cause a kid could find it. Right. Burn it. Well, then we're dealing with a fume situation. Yeah. You gotta wear masks and Yeah, it's a whole thing and It's a whole production. It's a big production. All right, then bury it! Oh, well No, see. Now we're back to the kids again.

Is that on us? No! Is that on us now? The community is still going down the toilet. So I think what you're saying, Sweet Dee, is that we could use the unsolvable drug problem in our society Mm-hmm. To fix the solvable light problem in our bar. Yes. Absolutely. I hear you. We're saying we're gonna do the drugs and then we're gonna try and fix all the lights. No. Charlie didn't understand that. That's asinine. You want to rewind? Yeah, we're gonna flip the drugs. Make a bunch of money. Use that money to fix the electricity. Mm-hmm. All right. Well, both ways work. I kinda like my way. Great plan. Your way's terrible. I'm in. Let's sell these drugs. You're not in. Whoop. Thank you. And you're not gonna sell them. We'll do it, Charlie. Because we found the drugs. And you're bossy. Very bossy. I'm not bossy. Scumbags! Frank, come on, man. Look, we're trying to get some money to fix the lights in our bar because you won't give it to us.

You know what? It's not obvious. Now you're being too vague. You're talking about dancing clams in the What's gonna make you dance?

They come from Colombia. They're illegal. And they rhyme with "propane. " Perfect. You found a perfect medium ground there. So you want to sell me cocaine? Yes! Why didn't you just come out and say that? Instead of dancing around it. That is so tacky. We talked about it in the car. It's a thing you do. It's not tacky.

Nobody's gonna get whacked off today, okay? Listen. We're gonna take the money. We'll go get our drugs back from Bingo. We'll give it to the mob. And we'll pretend none of this ever happened. And this time, I'll do the talking! Okay. Just keep my name out of it. Frank said to tell you to sell us back our drugs. Okay. No problem. Good. Good. Great. Excellent. Problem solved. $5,000. What? Oh, boy! Just an hour ago, you gave us 300 for 'em. Yeah, man. Yeah, I don't recall that. Come on! All right. What can we get for 300 then? Uh, you want an exotic bird? If you're gonna play this game, we need to buy something from you that we can sell back to other people at a higher price. Yeah. Okay. OxyContin. It's a very popular pill these days. And I happen to have a whole shitload of it. How much? Oh, boy. Wow. That's gonna Bingo! Wow. Goodness gracious with this guy. If it's not one thing, it's another thing. Oh, okay. But think about it this way. If we split it, it's only a few hundred dollars each. Great, yeah. Let me just go grab my cash from my money tree that I have planted. I know a leprechaun who has a pot of gold. He lives at the end of my street. Maybe I'll go to a bank and say, "Hello. Do I have an account here?" Call Donald Trump! How do three men in their 30s not have $800 between them? They're The economy is in shambles. Have you taken a close look at the marketplace right now? The NASDAQ! Dow Jones! It's up then down. Stop talking, goddamn it! Fine! I'll do it! I'm not getting my money back, am I? Give us money. Boom. What am I supposed to do with that? You tell us. Yeah. Bingo said you knew how to sell those drugs. I told you not to involve me in that! Did you mention my name? First thing we did. First thing we did. You gonna harp on it all day? Goddamn it! The guy's gonna skin me alive. He is gonna skin you alive. He mentioned something about it. Will you just pay the mob off so we don't have to sell these pills? Dennis, I am not using any more of my money! The mob is gonna kill us, man! Look, if I cave on this I'm gonna be bailing you guys out for the rest of my life. So I'm putting my foot down on this one. You bitches gotta earn your own money! Fine! Whatever! It doesn't matter. Because seeing as how I'm the boss You're not the boss. Oh, yes, I am. I've come up with an excellent idea. Frank, you are gonna get us into that country club that you used to belong to. And we're gonna sell the pills there. That'd be a good place to sell those pills. Yes. Thank you very much. You can't make no $25,000 from that amount of pills. How long you got? Till Friday. Mmmmm. You're gonna have to turn a trick or two. Go into prostitution. You are disgusting! How could you suggest I am absolutely not doing that! I wasn't talking about you. Guys at those country clubs get hotter broads than you. I would think, yeah. Yeah. I was saying the male escort Is really hard to come by. I'm picking up what you're putting down. I'll do it. Oh Uh, Charlie, you're not quite cut from the right cloth. What? Okay. Make it me. Mac, you're too low class. All those women are gonna think they're gonna catch somethin' from you. They are. They will. I was thinking about Dennis. Right. Now, Frank will any of these women be attractive in any way? Probably not. Then I'm not going to do it. Let's sell some drugs. I got it. Why are you grabbing it? I'm the boss. Very grabby. Get out. Really? Okay. I think we gotta look for old ladies with lots of big jewelry. They got the deepest pockets. Ah, that's my girl. Dennis, I think you should unbutton this button too. No Show a little chest. Frank, I know what you're trying to do. And I'm not gonna be a whore. So just drop it. All right? Holy shit. Did you guys see that midget dressed like a lawn jockey? That's a jockey, Charlie. Do what, now? That's a real jockey. The ones that ride on the horses Forget it! Really? Wait, wait, wait, wait. They have horses here? There's a racetrack next door, dude. Bye-bye. What? No! Where are you going, man? Where are you going? All right, whatever! Let's split up. I call Dennis. No. I'm not gonna be a whore, Frank. You're already a whore. Why not make some money at it? You're just gonna try and make me bang old ladies. Then you're gonna have me move on to dudes. I just wanna hang out. We're wasting time. Dee! Let's split up! Come on! Oh, that's good, huh? You like that? It's a real beaut, ain't she? Holy shit. You can talk? What? That is great. I would've figured if anything, your voice would be like super high. All right. Well, good for you. She normally doesn't take to strangers. She must like you, huh? Yeah. Wow. You know, she seems like a real nice horse. Well, actually, she kicked the last stable boy's brains in. Jesus. He takes his food through a straw now. I bet. Hey, you wouldn't be interested in taking his job, would ya? I'd be very interested. Well, you have any qualms about picking up shit? Terrific. Terrific. Usually, we'd use a shovel for that. But to each his own, I guess. Not me. Hey, why don't you come and meet the fellas? All right. Oh, right. Good work. Okay. Now, there's only one thing that these rich old men understand. And that is money. Mm-hmm. So I am gonna play the role of a high-powered executive. Mmm. And you are going to be my secretary, Linda. Ooh! No. No. I will be your business partner. Dee, these guys are old school, okay? They don't like women's rights. Now, don't give me any lip! Okay, Linda. The first thing I need you to do is get Jameson on the phone and tell him I don't need his $650,000 investment. He can shove it right back up his ass. Ooh, I got a better idea, Bob. How about you do it? What's that? Yeah. I think you should get Jameson on the phone for me. Well, why would I do that, Linda? You're my secretary and a woman. What do you know about investing? Oh, I'm sorry, Bob. Remind me again what we're having Jameson invest in? Jameson is investing in new technologies. Really? Which ones? Lasers. Lasers! Yep. That is adorable. Lasers, Linda! Who wants to buy some drugs? Hey, man. You workin'? Excuse me? Don't play dumb with me, hermano. I know a gigolo when I see one. No, look, I'm not a gigolo, all right? For real? Yeah.

Yeah, they just want someone to be nice to them. Flirt a little bit. That's it. Really? I wouldn't have to bang these ladies? No. Bro, it's all fancy dinners, exotic vacations. These ladies have so much cash, man. It's the life. You should really think about it. You could make a killing here, bro. Huh. Hey. Nice work. Hey, thanks, man. Oh, that's yours. Thank you very much.

I got a little something I gotta straighten out with the mafia. You know how that goes, right? Oh, sure. But when that's done maybe. Because there's something about that horse, Buster. You know, it's like we looked at each other. And then there was eye contact. And I was looking at the horse. The horse was looking at me. And then it hit me, I think maybe I was a centaur in my past life. Well, something tells me you probably were never half-man, half-horse. But, hell, what do I know? All I know is you got a great attitude. So come on, you old son of a gun and-and let Buster do a line off your boner. No? Uh, "garcon", why don't you hook up the young lady here with one of your best strawberry daiquiris? All righty. Thanks. Hey, how's it going, man? Uh, did you sell any of your pills? Uh, no. Actually, I'm kind of working a different angle here, Charlie. Dude, check it out. I sold all of mine. Okay, that's Lawn jockeys are crazy people, man. Did you know that? Great. But, uh You're kinda cramping my style. I'm trying to drum up business here. You know what I'm saying? You know what I'm saying? Dude, I think I was a centaur in my past life. It totally occurred to me. What makes you think you were half-man, half-horse? Charlie Come on. Out, out. He's working. What? I'm enjoying a roll. He's working. Bro, will you please get out of here? You smell like cheese. No, no. It's horse shit. Well, whatever it is, it's terrible. Okay? So Let's call it what it is. It's horse shit. I have it all over my hands. But it's not cheese. Let's go. Get up. The horse was eating a lot of cheese. I don't know what it is. Just you stink. Come on. Get up. Get up. I don't wanna get up. Frank, as a matter of fact, you really don't smell that much better. If you could get out, that would be really helpful. Don't talk to me that way. Don't talk to me. I am your pimp. You are my ho. Look, dude. Horses don't eat cheese. Don't You are ruining this! First of all. Will you get out of here, for the love of all that is holy on earth! You reek of cheese! Excuse me. Are you the Reynolds party? Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. We had to escort your friends off the property. They're waiting for you by your car. Oh Yeah. Where? Ah, the guilty parties. Yeah. Yeah, Mac made a whole series of bad decisions. And then we got kicked out, and they stole our drugs. Was he being bossy? Yeah. He was being very bossy. And now we've got nothing. All right. It's not a total loss, all right? No, no, no. Charlie actually I sold all my pills. Oh! Nice. Oh, that's awesome. What about you, Dennis? Dennis is a prostitute now. Good. No, I'm not prostitute, okay? Yes, he is. There's no banging old ladies and dudes. All right? I will be providing a very important service, however as what I would like to be called a handsome companion. To dudes? To guys or No, not to dudes. No, hang on. Hold on. Hang on. To old, fancy, rich ladies who want to do classy, exotic, fancy things with me. Great. Dennis, you keep banging dudes. Dee, let's take Charlie's money and go buy some cocaine.

You're not kicking me out. I'm the boss of you! You're the only one who hasn't made any forward progress today. Just hang back. Wait. I'm just supposed to put my life into your hands? Look, man. Leave your ego out of it. We're in some Excuse me! We're in some serious hot water here because of you and your bossiness, all right? I think you should stop acting like such a baby. Go on. So you're gonna leave me here? We cannot have you around us screwing things up! How am I supposed to get home? You're supposed to walk like the rest of the Americans. You walk, you know?

You want to stop It already? It's all right. I put the parking brake on. Sorry about that, boys. Hey, you got our money? Jesus. No, I do not have your money. But I think there's been a misunderstanding here. And I want to set it straight. Proceed. Well, ever since your alleged package Came into my bar, I may or may not have had absolutely nothing to do with it. You did or you didn't? I did. You did have something to do with it? No. No. I did have absolutely nothing to do with it. Wait, wait. You just said you did have something to do with it. That's what I heard. I heard that. I think I said I did have absolutely nothing to do with it. But you said Are you sure? The thing is when you use a double negative, it becomes something completely different. But you know, we can get into that later. The point is this, guys. I want to get in on what you guys got. I want to dress like a track star. I want to wear gold shit and slick my hair back and grow a pompadour, you know? You want to join our crew, huh? More than anything. Okay, first things first. You gotta prove your loyalty. Prove my loyalty? Yeah. I want you to go clean the bathrooms. Yeah. The bathrooms? Yeah. The bathrooms. Why? 'Cause that's the first step in becoming a part of our crew! Okay. Guys, I clean a mean bathroom. Let's see. I learned from one of my friends, Charlie. You'll get to know him too maybe. I'll bring him in. I'm sure you will. Okay. Thank you. Go. Thank you. You gonna really let him be part of our crew? Hey, summer squash for brains I'm gonna make him our bitch till Friday. Oh, bitch boy. Bitch boy. And after that? I wanna whack him off irregardless.                     We keep putting more on, and It's not showing up at all. Well, then I guess cocaine is weightless, all right? I'm gonna file that up here actually. What are you doing? Cleaning my hands off. What are you, a cat? Use a towel. My mouth's right here. We talked about this. No getting high on the supply. I'm not getting high. I'm just cleaning my hands. We have to be very careful, considering our past addictions to glue and crack. We got over that. I got over that. I don't smoke crack anymore. You huff glue every single day. No, I don't. No? Did you have any today? It's still gross, Frank. We made a thousand dollars. No. I made a thousand dollars. You didn't do shit. You just sat in the car and read a magazine. What the hell do I need you for? Give me that money. Every ho needs his pimp. We got any vials around here? Vials for what? We went back to Bingo. We got a little of the cocaine back with the money that we got from the pills. You better go back and get a gun, because dealin' drugs is dangerous. No, it isn't. It's a rich person's drug. There's no danger involved. It's, like, stockbrokers and high-powered business executives. We'll just go down to Center City and Waltz into a board meeting, slap your drugs down on the conference table and be, like, "Hey, you guys wanna buy drugs? We're drug dealers. " Are you saying that's not gonna work? What are you saying? What are you saying exactly? I'm saying that that is not gonna You don't like that idea? At least we didn't become prostitutes. I am not a prostitute. I am providing Let me handle this. Dennis is providing a very important service to lonely people in need. Really? So he speaks for you now? No. I was He doesn't have to speak if he doesn't want to. I don't? Really? No. You leave everything to me. All you have to do is sit there, relax, have yourself a drink and just keep looking handsome. Okay. I like that arrangement. Get me a beer, Frank. Oh, no beer. Too many calories. Yep. It's all about keeping this body fit. Mm-hmm. Ehheh. I'll get you a nice vodka tonic. Well, that doesn't have much calories so I think that's a smart drink. I take care of my boy. Every time you talk, you weaken the nation. Shut up. Why you wanna hurt me? I'm not hurtin' you. Just shut up and play cards. You're judgin'. You judge me all the time. I'm just tryin' to remain elegant over here. Don't try so hard. Remain quiet. Oh! Youse guys got the right idea with these. It's, like, the perfect mix of comfort and wind resistance. They make that In men's? Huh? I think this is men's. Yeah, it's men's. Listen, guys. I was thinkin' we go down to Paddy's, put the squeeze on 'em. We're right in the middle of somethin' right now. Don't you guys do anything besides play cards and eat deli meats? Go wash my car. Fellas! I feel like I'm being seriously underutilized here. Look, if you just give me a chance I could show you how hard I actually am. What? That's right. I'm so hard that people are scared of me. And they should be, 'cause I'll explode all over them. What's the matter with you? I'm eatin' here. What? What are you talkin' about, your dick? My dick? No, I'm talkin' about my brute force and my catlike reflexes. You hear that, Anthony? He's got catlike reflexes. That's right. Hands like a cat. You know what? I think someone just earned themselves a nickname. Really? What? Yep. From now on, you'll be known as Pussy Hands. I'd like to go on record saying I don't like Pussy Hands. But Cougar Hands would be good. Here's to you, Pussy Hands. That's great. It's settled. Hey, Pussy Hands, go wash my car. How about Jaguar Hands? Nah. Leopard Hands? Nah. Panther Hands. Nah. Goddamn it. Go get your saucer of milk, honey. He does have gorgeous hands though. Excuse us. Excuse me. Sir? Ma'am? Hi. Would you two be interested in These people are just walking too fast. You know what we should do? We should go back to the country club. Remember the country club, with the jockeys? This about the horse, Charlie? It is about the horse. Goddamn it. I'm pretty sure those jockeys are raping that horse. They're raping the shit out of it. Excuse me, sir. Can I talk They're racing by us as fast as they can. These people are revved up. They're in fifth gear, and we're stuck in first. We need to boost our r.p.m.'s. Let's get goin' a little bit. What are you suggesting? A little dip into our Bolivian marching powder, then we're back on the street. Not in your nose. That's how you become a drug addict. Rub it all over your gums, Dee. All over your gums. Okay. Feel that? How's that feel for you? Whoa. I see what you mean, Charlie. I see It's like my mouth is no longer a part of my head. I kind of feel nothing, but it feels so good. That's the feeling you're going for. That's where you wanna be at. Keep reapplying every 10 to 15 minutes. That's what I've been doing. It kinda wears down. What? Charlie. Ten to 15 minutes? No. We're gonna run out. No more gumming for a little while. No more gumming. We're good though. I'm ready. I'm good. I feel pretty good. I feel weird, but pretty good. Let's start the show. Let's be like Wall Street and Rickety Cricket. That's Rickety Cricket! Rickety! Rickety Cricket! Rickety! Rickety Cricket! Rickety! Where have you been hiding? Where have you been? They let you become a priest again, huh? Congratulations. It's the reverend. Hey, man. How you doin', man? Keep your head up, Reverend. Keep the faith. Bless you. Oh. Yikes. I get it. It's like Okay. Ever since you convinced me to abandon the church my life has been in a bit of a tailspin. Who? Me or Charlie? You, Dee. You. That doesn't ring a bell. There was something that happened. I wasn't sure that it was that. I don't think it was that. So you're livin' on the streets now, Cricket. Yes, I'm living That's great. That's really great. Actually, it's the opposite of great, Charlie. It's one of the darkest times of my life. Is it? Is it? That makes sense. Yes. But the good thing is that you must know a lot of drug addicts. Yes. I was actually attacked by a couple last night. Almost got stabbed. Really? That's great. Did you? Did you really? Wonderful, Cricket. Then you can help us sell our cocaine. Do you know those guys? Can you sell drugs to them? Do you bump into them? Do you guys hang out on certain corners? Are you close? Whoa, whoa, whoa. You want me to sell drugs for you? We would do it, but we're not street urchins. Yeah, man. Yeah. Know what I mean? But you. They would buy drugs from a street urchin like yourself. You got the "street urchin" thing goin' on. Please stop calling me a street urchin. I'm not a street urchin. You are what you are now. You know what I'm sayin'. I was a priest. I have a master's in theology. That was then. This is now. What good's it doing you? I am trying to get my life back on track. I don't think selling drugs is a smart move. Uhoh. I'm sorry. Come on, Cricket. I guess Charlie and I didn't see you sitting atop your homeless ivory tower. Oh, oh, oh, oh. What is your problem? You just push my buttons, don't you? You just enjoy pushing my buttons. What have you done? I've done nothing to her. Can I stop this little lovers' quarrel? You're not fooling anybody, Cricket. Clearly, the two of you have strong feelings for each other and you're letting that get in the way of a good business deal here. Look, Cricket, for the love of God, help us out here, man. I am not I tell you what. I'll let you stay at Dee's place. No. Till you're back up on your feet. Dee's place? Yeah. You two alone, together. One thing could lead to another. You never know. You think she still likes me? Yeah. I wasn't sure. I know we have sort of a sexual tension. No, no, no. You guys got your own thing going on. I gotta take a cut now, Cricket. We're working together. Jesus Christ, Frank. I can't believe you had that thing made. Every pimp has a chalice. This one is the shit. Great. How much money did you drop on that? A lot. You spend a shitload of money on a chalice you're just gonna eat cereal out of but you won't bail us out by paying the mob? By the way, your Jane is sitting over there. Aw, you gotta be kid Dude, she's, like, a hundred years old. Sixty-eight tops. That's still extremely old. Well, I'm not kissing that. You don't have to kiss her. We can make that one of your rules. This time, nothing with the ass. That got really weird last time. What are you talkin' about? You didn't set up that ass play on the last one? No. I never set up any ass play. All right. Well. I wanna set up a doctor's appointment anyway just to be just to be safe. All right. Do that. All right. Here we go. Hypothetically speaking here do you think you could teach a horse to sit on a barstool and drink beer? I don't know. Maybe. Would you hypothetically pay really good money to see that? Is this about bringing a horse back to the bar? That is completely insane. I'm askin' hypothetical questions here. I'm sorry. I'm a little preoccupied with worrying about being killed by the mob because a homeless priest ran off with all of our drugs. Sure. Sure. Who is it? It's Matt. Who? Matthew Mara. It's Rickety Cricket. It's Rickety Cricket. It's Rickety Cricket. Hey! Come on in, man. Hey! Come in. Oh! Yeah! Where should I put this? Why does he have that? Why does he have his stuff? Charlie said I could move It's not important. Look at this place. It's exactly as I imagined it would be. What is? Cricks? How'd you do with our drugs, man? Oh. Uh, I sold 'em. Here. Hey, is there a dream catcher above your bed? Shit, shit, shit! Holy shit! Look at all that money. That is a huge wad of money. This is more money than we make at the bar. I have never seen this much money in one spot. Oh, my God. I guess we can pay the mob back. We can definitely pay them back. That's good. But we have another day. We have a whole day. We have 24 whole hours to go. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. He flipped this in what? No time really. He flipped it so fast, Charlie. Let's think a little bit for a second. We could flip another batch. We could pay the mob back. We could have money left over for ourselves. Maybe a little coke. Yeah, more coke. I can get a horse. You're not gonna get a horse, Charlie. We can have some coke then. She likes Swiss! I knew it! I pictured Swiss. Hey, uh, Cricket. Cricket, buddy. Can I talk to you for a second? Look, uh, you did such a fantastic job that we're gonna need you to go back out there and do it again. But you guys said it was a onetime thing. We say things all day. We say words all the time. We said so many things. I was thinking maybe I'd curl up on that bed of Dee's and I'd sleep with the bear. Now's not a good time for that, man. I'm so tired. Are you tired? I'm just so tired. Check it out. I got the thing for you right here. Where'd you get that? Every good dealer keeps a head stash. No. Dip your finger in there. Look, Cricket. I got the thing for you here. I can't. Let's speed you up. And then you'll wanna get back out there. Oh. Aah. Yeah. Oh. Shh. Where am I having dinner tonight, Frank? I'm kind of in the mood for Asian fusion. No more dinners. We're going straight to bangin' from now on. Check this out. Jesus Christ, man. What, you got a problem? Yeah. This makes me seem like a whore. You are a whore. I'm not a whore. I'm a handsome companion who goes to nice dinners with fancy women and who has rules about what he'll do. What happened to the rules, Frank? You can still have your rules. It says right here "No Rules. " Don't be so uptight. I'm walkin' from this What the hell, dude? I'm knocking some sense into you, Dennis. This is all you got. Dude, why do you keep hitting me? Don't talk back to me! Okay. Sorry. Look, I'm gonna get you out of this. It's you and me against the world. I'm not gonna let anything bad happen to you. You promise? I promise. And, hey, I don't wanna hit you, baby. So please don't make me, okay? You're my one and only. You gotta do right by me, okay? Okay. Come on, Cricket. Where is he, Charlie? Why do we trust him? He came through for us once. He'll do it again. This is empty. Get rid of that. You know what, this is his whole plan. It's not a plan. Yeah. He convinced us that he was on our side. Now he's gonna stab us in the back. I don't think so. What's with the pants? These things? These are horse-riding pants. You can't get a horse. Why not? Because it's crazy. Is it any crazier than having a dog that bites or sheds? Or a cat that poops in a box while it's biting you? While it's biting you? Oh! You guys! Cricket! There you are! What are you doing? Cricket! There you are! I'm workin' on my moves. What moves? For my musical. I'm writing a musical. It's about life on the streets. Archangel has to live on the streets and fight crime. What? That's great. Where are our drugs? I sold the drugs. Good. Give us the money. Spent the money on these sweetass kettledrums. Look at these. Those are trash cans. Trash cans, Cricket! These are trash cans? Then why do they sound like this? You "sold" our drug money on two garbage cans? No. No, no, no, no. I did some too. We can see that! Is there any left? Can we have what's left? There is some left. You guys are yelling like crazy. I can't compute. Don't do all of it. I still gotta write the seventh act. It's kinda all up here. Come on back to the bar. Let's go. I'm not going anywhere without these kettledrums. Bring your trash cans. Yeah, don't forget the trash cans. I'm bringing the trash cans. Watch the crack addicts though. They will cut you. You understand? It's $200 for the first hour and a hundred and fifty every hour after that. Unless you want him to act like he's enjoying it. Then it's a little extra. Eh? All right. I need I need you Make it sexy. I need I need you You like ass play? He'll do anything with the ass. I never said I wasn't gonna tell Don Sal? Yeah. What? Forgive me for speaking out of line here, but I don't think I'm being properly utilized within the organization. I've tried to be eager and work with a smile but I'm not making any forward progress. Aren't you the janitor? It's not important, Don Sal. What is important is that I get out on those streets and start doing some gangster shit. There's gotta be a union boss I can put the squeeze on. Or a truck I can hijack, right? How would you like to do me a personal favor? Sounds shady. I'm in. Good. I need you to go over to my house and take care of my wife. You mean, like, rub her out? No. Oh. You want me to bang her? I'm sorry. No! What the hell is wrong with you? Why would you say that? Communication problem. What I need you to do is just go over there. Like a protection thing. Yeah. It's somethin' like that. Okay. I mean, you don't mind gettin' your hands dirty, do you? Absolutely not. Good. Goddamn mafia! Two hearts that beat as one Like that? Huh? Get what you want? Just keep dancing, whore. Two hearts that beat as one Dennis? We gotta talk. Now. What the hell you doin' here? I'm working. What are you doing? You cannot seriously be thinking about banging this old lady. No, Mac, you have to separate yourself from the way they look. Frank says that the only thing that matters in this game is cash.

They broke my legs but they didn't break my spirit But I don't feel no pain 'cause I found more cocaine Cocaine                       Oh, my God. There's a masturbating bum in the alley. He's masturbating. Yeah. I know about that guy. Masturbating bums are bad for business. Yes. I saw that guy's wiener. He's gonna rip it off one of these days. It's disgusting. It really is. This whole goddamn neighborhood is going to shit. There is a deteriorating situation here, and we gotta do something about it. We should get a junkyard dog. Okay? A really mean, nasty junkyard dog. Ooh. We'll chain him up in the alley. We'll scare away the bums. That's it. Charlie, it's not just about our alley. It's about this whole neighborhood. I think we should make this whole neighborhood safe again. Yeah. Kind of leaning towards the junkyard dog idea. You like the dog idea? I'd go for a dog. Now, first order of business is thanking Jean for working so hard on our monthly crime watch newsletter. Uh, do you have a question? Yeah. New to the crew. Uh, quick question about the uniform situation. Now, I like to cut my sleeves off. It's kind of my look. So I'm wondering if the tailor is provided for us, or I'm left to my own devices. We don't have uniforms. Now, but Yes? Yeah. Will you be providing the weapons? No. No. Oh! I get it. Okay. We go buy the weapons. We tell you how much we spent, and you reimburse us. Great. It doesn't work like that. You gotta give him a receipt. Oh, I would make a copy of the receipt. You give them the original. I would give them the original and I would keep the copy? That seems stupid. That's how reimbursement works. If something happens to the weapons, I'm shit out of luck? You just ask 'em for the original back. I'm sure they got a system. Why would they keep the original? I'm the one that bought the gun. Oh, it's a gun now. It's always been a gun, Dee. Excuse me. Hi. Hi. We don't carry weapons. We're just a neighborhood watch. Wait. So you people don't apprehend criminals? If we see anything suspicious, we call the police. The police? The police. The streets are flooded with the ejaculate of the homeless and you people are counting on the police? Clearly we are gonna have to handle this ourselves, Dee. You, sir, have wasted my time, and the time of my associate. Dee, get my coat. You hear barking? I don't hear no dogs. They'll run out and bite you in the nuts. They're probably sleepin'. You don't wanna wake 'em. Probably chained up. I don't hear a dog. We'll ask this guy. Excuse me, sir. Where am I finding your junkyard dogs? My what? We wanna buy a junkyard dog. We want the most vicious one you have. Yeah, a really nasty dog. Really nasty dog. We don't have no dogs. What I'm sorry. Is this not a junkyard? You don't have a dog? We got a cat round here somewhere. Cat? We don't We don't want a cat. Walt a minute. Wait a minute. Believe me, that's a tough cat. It was born in a pool of gasoline, on a piece of rusty scrap metal. I've seen that cat jump through barbed wire into a vat of hot tar. That cat Is indestructible. We don't want no cat. Great. It's a cat. We want a dog. Well, now, wait a second. I wouldn't mind taking a look at that cat. Come on, dude. What are we gonna do with a cat? Whoa. Go ahead. Knock yourself out. Is that a cop car? You guys, if we park that in front of Paddy's, no more bums. No problems, period. Is that old cop car for sale? Everything's for sale. We'll take it. And throw in that cat. This thing's cool, right? Yeah, it's very cool. The seating's a little tight. The seating is very tight. It's cramped. Well, I know it's cramped. Maybe if a certain someone didn't buy a certain something there'd be a little bit more room up here. This guy's not the problem. This guy's not the problem. You're the problem. I'm the problem, dude? You're the problem. Why don't you jump in the back? I called shotgun. You have to get in the back. I wanna fiddle with all the gadgets. Fool with 'em. Why are we stopped? Yeah, why are we stopped? It's a red light. We're in a cop car. Make 'er sing. Boom. We look so stupid. We look awesome. Throw that on. I'm not putting on a beret. Gotta wear the beret. It's terrible, and I don't get the point. It sends a message, Dee. The Guardian Angels wore the same, exact outfit when they cleaned up the streets of New York City in the 1970s. We look like Rerun. You know what I hear when you talk like that? A scared little girl who's never had anyone fear her. Fear is power, Dee. Don't you get that? It's like a drug. Once you get a taste of it, you can never get enough. If I promise to wear this stupid thing, will you stop talking? Absolutely. All right. Let's roll. What's that? That's my mini bat. You're gonna hit that bum? No, I'm not gonna hit anybody. That's the best part about fear and intimidation, Dee. All you gotta do is look the part. Now what do you think about these suspenders? All right, you ready? I mean, I guess so. Let's clean up the streets. This is how it's gonna work. You're gonna walk right up to him. You're gonna kindly ask him to leave. He's gonna see me with the bat, looking tough. He's gone. That's it? That's all you need to do when you look like a badass, Dee. That's not gonna work. Yes, It will. Oh, Mac, I can hear It. Come on. He's smiling at me. All right, give me the bat. You know what, asshole? You like that, bitch? Huh? I am not your little pinup girl for you to tug your rotten pecker at! Go on, get out of here. You're one crazy bitch. I don't wanna see you or your dirty balls in my alley again! Whoa! Yeah. Yeah, you took my bat. I kicked that guy's ass. I would have helped you. I need my bat back. That was awesome. Okay, that was, but next time just don't take my bat. Heyo! Freeze, punk. Cool, huh? Gonna ride around In a cop car, can't do It In street clothes. People'll think you stole it. That's awesome. Where's mine? Uh Uh, well, Charlie, these things cost me a pretty penny. Yeah, Frank really sprung for all the bells and whistles. You shittin' me? You didn't get me one? You guys know how I love dressing up in costumes. Dude, that's bullshit. Charlie, you can't have three guys dressed in cop suits in the front seat of a cop car. No. It don't look right. Plus we need room for Agent Bauer. Well, who's Agent Bauer? Oh, come on. You're gonna let the stupid junkyard cat ride up front? It smells like it's been dumped in a bucket of piss. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Do not refer to him as a junkyard cat. He has a name Agent Jack Bauer. Come on, I don't wanna ride around in the back seat. Charlie You can be disguised as an undercover cop in the back seat. Yeah, dude. Then you can wear all the disguises you want. Damn it! That is such a good idea. No one's gonna know, dude. I'm gonna be, like, "You're busted. Hello. How ya doin'? You're busted. " All right, let's get you back to C.T.U., Agent Bauer. Ho! Over here, pal. Hey, hey. Boys in blue. What's shakin', pal? Ahh. Hey, you fellas hungry? Couple my best dogs, on the house. That sounds like the move. Yeah, you boys cruise in one of the old models, huh? Oh, yeah, yeah. This is a place of junk. They're cuttin' back. The brass is breakin' our balls. Say, what'd this guy do? We caught him diddling kids over at a playground. Yeah, he's a perv. We're gonna bust him up good. You just go and get us a couple of those tasty dogs. Okay, okay. Let me see what I can do, huh? Okay. Okay. Holy shit, that actually worked. These uniforms are gonna pay for themselves 10 times over. You're brilliant, man. You know what else I realized? They didn't even realize I was an undercover cop. Yeah, okay. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna become Al Pacino in Serpico. I'm gonna be Al Pacino Nobody cares. Get in there. You're gonna ruin it. Hey, hey. Here you go, boys. You keep up the good work. All righty. Thanks, pal. I got a great Serpico costume. Diddle, diddle, diddle. Yeah, it's It's really something else. I don't care. Get in the car. Don't push my head like that. Let's go, Frank. Dennis, do you have to take that cat everywhere we go? Yeah. He's awesome. Have you taken a good look at this guy? He's hilarious. It's a mangy cat. I don't like the cat. Serpico doesn't like the cat one bit. I don't give a shit, Charlie 'cause you're not Serpico. I'm goin' on record. We gotta get rid of that cat. It stinks. Stinkin' cat. We're not gettin' rid of the cat. There's nothing you guys can do. The cat outranks you. I'm not outranked by a cat. Oh, yeah, you are. Cat's a special agent. Are you a special agent? Here's a special agent over there. Look at this guy here. He's jaywalking. Take it easy, Charlie. Take it easy. No, no. Back me up here. I'm goin' in. Hey, guy! Charlie, where you goin'? What are you doing? Hello, guy! Hello! You wanna stop for a second? You like just crossin' the street whenever you want, makin' up your own laws? I'm sorry You ought to be sorry. You just jaywalked, buddy. You gonna give me a ticket? That depends on how much money you got in your wallet. I don't know. Like, 15 bucks, I guess. Fork it over. And the watch. You're serious? Do I look like I'm smiling? Are we smiling? I can't believe this is happening. Believe it, buddy. Gimme your watch. Come on. Take a walk. Get out of here. Yeah, get the hell out of here. Useless. Put an egg in your shoe and beat it. What the hell was that shit right there? Huh? We got 15 bucks. We got I don't want a cut. You don't take your cut, how do we know how to trust you? That's dirty money. Look, guys, we're cops.

Well, you guys are taking bribes now. That's bullshit. I'm walkin'. Oh, you're gonna do Christopher Walken now? I'm not doing Christopher Walken. I'm walking from the situation. Get the hell out of here. Go on. Go on. You guys are crooked cops, and I don't like it. The kid's nuts. He's an idiot. Gimme my cut. Here's five bucks. Gimme that. I'll take the 10. All right. I'm keepin' the watch. Keep the watch. I'm going to. Watch out for the cars. Whoa! Hey! Hold it. Hey, toots. Knock, knock. Can I help you? The real question is, can we help you? See, my partner and I have been cleaning up the streets the past couple days. Is that right? Yeah, that's right. We know how the system works. You guys can't get your hands dirty. We're not afraid of that. Getting physical That's not a problem for us. We are all on the same team. Okay? So if you could fast track us through like, a citizen deputy type program Yeah, and, you know, toss us a couple of badges. You know, make it all legal. We can work together on this. Well, let's see. Oh! You know what? I'm fresh out of badges. Oh. I get it. I see what you did. See, I sense your sarcasm. I'm used to it. Okay? Let me just say Doesn't help, and I don't appreciate it. It just hurts my feelings, because we are sticking our necks out for you guys and, frankly, doing your job better than you are. Really? I tell you what. I do know of a neighborhood that could use your help. Perfect. Where? Davis? Leroy? These two Guardian Angels would love to help you clean up your beat. Okay, gentlemen, thank you for the ride. Quick question. What time are you picking us up? No, no, no. Oh, shit. Well, we're screwed. No, Dee, Dee, Dee. Relax, okay? So we are in a lower socioeconomic, African American neighborhood. Yes, we are, but that's okay. That's okay. We're Guardian Angels. That's fine. We're tough, right? We're tough. Okay! Right. Okay. Stop doing that. Guardian Angels, right? We're Guardian Angels, blind to this kind of thing. Yes, okay. We can do this. We are gonna make these streets safe We are gonna make these streets safe. Everything is gonna That was a gunshot.

You've been loitering on this corner for the last 20 minutes like you own the goddamn place. I don't think I follow you. Oh, yeah? Don't get cute with me, pal. I will jam you up so hard. I will jam you from morning until night. You wanna get jammed up? Huh? You like gettin' jammed up? No. No. No. I didn't think so. Good. Gimme that wallet. Yeah. Yeah. Let's go. Come on. All right. What do we got here? Oh. Time to hit the A.T.M., huh? So I'll have five hot dogs. I want you to mash one of' em up in a bowl. Put some milk or some water, you know? Mash it up nice and good, but, you know, four regulars, five hot dogs altogether. Look, I'm sorry, Lieutenant, but no more free hot dogs. I mean, look, maybe if it was just you I could swing it but it's you, your partner, and now I'm feedin' your cat? I just can't afford it. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Sorry. Hold on. Hold on. Oh.

Tough titties? Yeah, tough titties. Dennis, this thing with the cat has gone too far. I'm puttin' my foot down. It's gonna be either the cat or me. Okay, I choose the cat. All right, then I'm takin' the badge. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doin'? Are you crazy? Get out of here. Hey, I bought that badge, I bought this uniform and I bought that cop car. I don't give a shit. I'm gonna tell you something, buddy. Your days as a cop of this town are over. You and that mangy cat. This is a stinkin', dirty hellhole of a town. And I'm gonna clean it up. Let's do this thing. See, now I feel very powerless. I don't like it. I would like to beat somebody up so I could feel better. You try to do something good, and you get nothing in return. What is the point? Respect. Reward. Compensation for a job well done. What's with the cat? Don't start in on the cat. I swear to God, I will jam you into the middle of next week. We will jam and jam and jam until there is nothing left of the two of you to jam. Do you understand what we're saying to you? Not really. Calm down, dude. All right, here's the situation. Frank and I got our hands on a cop car. We were cruisin' around in it. We were actin' like cops. Everything was goin' great, but then it got to Frank's head and he squeezed me out. You two have not begun to feel the power and respect that you get when you are cruising around in a cop car. See, we've been cleaning up the streets, and all we've gotten is mugged. You deserve better than that. We deserve better than that. So here's what we gotta do. We gotta get rid of Frank. We gotta get our hands on that cop car. Yeah, okay. I'm in. What's the plan? All right. Frank's got beef with a certain hot dog vendor and I was thinkin', if something bad were to happen to one of his carts Well, we could put the frame on Frank. Really get him into some trouble. Right, Jack? Bingo. What'd you say, Charlie? Huh? You just said something. No, I was, uh I think you said, "bingo. " Stop playing with your stupid tape recorder. Go clean those bathrooms. That's not a Charlie, clean the bathroom. Mmm. What is this? That right there is a tale of corruption and intrigue the likes of which are gonna rock this city. "Spin Doctors mix"? I taped over the Spin Doctors mix. Sir, I do not have time to listen to your mix tape. No, it's not a m Look, uh, I'm ready to blow my whistle here. You know what I'm saying? I got a laundry list of corruption charges Extortion, bribery, junkyard cats. This is nasty, heavy stuff. Now, you gonna listen to this tape or not? No, I am not. Oh. Oh, I get it. You're one of them, huh? A crooked cop. Yeah, I get it! Everybody's a crooked cop, huh? Am I the only cop left in Philadelphia who ain't crooked? Oh Oh, I see what's happening. You wanna come at Serpico, huh? Who wants a place of Serpico? 'Cause I'll give It to you. I'll give a piece, 'cause you're forgetting about this. And you're forgetting about whatever the hell that is. But you're forgetting about it. And I'm gonna take this right to the mayor, and you're gonna remember. We really gotta do something about these homeless people. That kitty is really loving this Molotov cocktail. Ho, ho, ho there, Jack. That's not a toy. He's slurping down that gasoline no problem. What's the deal with that? Yeah, he's got a thing for gasoline. He was born in a pool of it. Hello. Just stopped in for a cold beer to enjoy with my free hot dog. You parked in a red zone. I'm gonna let it fly this time, but be careful. Oh, thanks, Frank. I appreciate that. I'll take care of it. Yeah. In fact, Special Agent Bauer and I intend to take care of a few things today. Oh, hey there, guys. What's goin' on, huh? Up to no good? A little crime and corruption? I hope you guys don't mind if I borrow this. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Charlie, what are you doing? Charlie, where you going? Oh, you know where I'm going, Frank. Charlie, drop your weapon. Don't do that. What are you doing? I'm putting an end to this, is what I'm doing. Oh, no. Charlie We were supposed to be cops. We were supposed to care about justice, and it got to your head. I'll get a hose. That's not gonna do any good. I doused the whole car full of gasoline. What? Whoa! Goddamn It, Jack Bauer. You really are the man. Okay, Mr. Mayor. Feast your ears on that Spin Doctors mix. Hooah!                       Dude, I'm not gonna read this bullshit. Just get me a Coors. "What do I think my greatest strength as a server Is? ' What the hell is this, Frank? Employee evaluation. This bar is a business, and we're gonna start acting like one. I do not want to start acting like a business because that sounds boring as shit. Yeah, that sounds terrible. Plus this thing's Well, that's gonna affect your rank. What rank? I put us all on a ranking system so you kids would care about your jobs. Are we ranked now? Yes, we are. What's my rank? Second, after me. Wait! What's my rank? You're third. What? Why am I third? Too volatile. Bullshit! That is bullshit! Okay, okay. What am I? You're fifth. Fifth? That's last. Why in the hell would I be last? Too much lip and very sassy. Sassy? That doesn't make sense.

What is that awful noise? We got our first dance-off challenge! I need Mac to collect his dignity and step to the center of this dance floor. What? We've only been dancing for two minutes. Who's challenged me? Oh, shit. Our two dancers have one song to strut Their stuff! The loser will have to wear this for the rest of the competition. Talk about a ball and chain.

Why don't we mix things up a little bit By slowing things down. Everybody couple up and hit the dance floor. Don't be afraid to get "sextra" close. Osmond close on Q 102. The Q Crew. I do not even understand the smell coming from your body, dude. Relax, dude. I forgot to put on deodorant. You gonna give me shit all day? I have never seen you wear deodorant, Charlie. You've never seen me wash my testicles, but that doesn't mean I don't do it every Friday. And I swear to God you've got lice, man. I see little bugs crawling all over your body. That's glitter. I tried to make myself look a little fancy for this dance competition. Oh, Mr. Fancy Pants. Excuse me. I'm just trying to have a good competition here. I gotta get outta here. When is the partner switch? Ooh, this could be a great idea to shake things up a little bit with the other contestants. You know, use the partner switch to get inside people's heads. Why is the person that's ranked last trying to hatch a plan? Yeah, I wonder that too. I just came up with an idea though. This could be a good opportunity to shake things up with the other contestants. We could use this partner switch to get into people's heads. Now you're talking! Are you being serious? Shut up. We're hatching a plan. But we're gonna need a man on the outside. Frank, that's you. Why? Because I'm old? That's bullshit! No, dude. Because you're the best at scheming. We need you on the outside running things. Take a knee. Kneel down. Take a knee for the team, buddy. Yeah, there you go! Yeah! Ooh! Another one bites the dust. Q Crew! We did just screw him over to kick him out of the contest, right? Absolutely, yeah. What? And by the way, Frank, when we get the bar back, you're ranked last! You can't rank me last. I created the ranking system. Then you shouldn't have dropped out, you old bitch. You lousy bastards. So who's next? Who's looking good out there? That young couple over there looks pretty limber. We should take them out. Okay, I'll take the girl. I'm gonna dance with the waitress for a little while. That's not gonna work. Mac, take the waitress. You can tire her out with your spastic movement. I'll tire her out with my awesome movements. Yeah, whatever it is. You should get into it more, Dee. Oh, this is great, Dee. I mean, this is so restful. I'm really building up my reserves for later, you know? Mmm, yeah. I'm just really glad I can be of help, Charlie. Thank you. Mac and the waitress are getting pretty close. What's the matter? Can't keep up? No, I can't understand why you're dancing like that. I feel like you're gonna hit me. Just Please don't hit me. Good, good. Don't be afraid to get in real close, okay? Okay. How long have you been a dance instructor? Oh, a long time. Years. My fiancé and I, we're not really dancers. We just joined this competition because we both got laid off recently Right, right, okay. I'm gonna dip you down now, okay? Just stick your knee into my groin, just like that. Grind your hips and pulse your thighs. Ready? Go. What the hell are you doing? Relax. He's an instructor. He's showing me a new dance. What's it called again? The Rococo Bang. Oh, that's funny. Isn't it? Kinda looks like he's feeling you up. I don't want to get in the middle of anything here, okay? I'm just trying to teach your fiancée a new dance. You don't want to deprive her of that, do you? I think a little dance instruction might help us last longer in the competition. All right. Just make it quick. I'll make it quick. All right now, Gloria, for this next part you're gonna want to grip my buttocks. Okay. Like that? Right. Now we're gonna go down nice and low. Now grind and shift and around and push and feel and grip and grip. I see. Yeah. Good. I'm over it anyway. Are you? So let's not worry about it. Let's just talk about other things for a little bit. I'm glad you're over it, because he's definitely gonna bang her. He's gonna bang her? You're not over it! I gotta stop that. I can't let that go on. You know what I think you gotta do? You gotta get Mac out of this competition. Yes! Yes! I gotta get him out. You gotta get rid of him. All right, how would I do that? I got an idea. They burned you, too, didnt they? I know how it feels. The pain, the hurt. How about you and me, we join forces, and we make things right? Get lost, street rat! I'm not a street I was a man of the cl Look, I want these guys, Frank. I want 'em! And I will stalk the streets and live in the shadows of the night until the streets of Philadelphia run red with their blood! You got a lot of anger in you, kid. You're damn right! Are you in or out? I'm in. Yeah! Whoo! Here he is. Hey, bro. What a competition, huh? Saw you dancing with the waitress. But I'm not jealous. I'm very impressed with your dance moves. Thank you, Charlie. Much better dancing than people give you credit for. I've always thought that. That whole elbow thing You like the elbow thing? It's a very specifically choreographed I'll show it to you one day. I don't want to learn it. You probably couldn't pull it off anyway. Hey, man. How do you feel about Dennis? Dennis? Dennis has been driving me crazy. I feel like he's a little jealous. And nervous. Nervous that you're gonna be ranked number one when this whole thing goes down. You think so? Absolutely! First of all, you deserve to be ranked number one at the bar. I think I do, dude. I think I deserve to be number one. I've been working so hard for so many years. The cream always rises to the top. And you're, like, made of cream, and your cream is all over his face, man. That pisses him off. He hates that shit, dude. I'm always putting my cream all over his face, and it pisses him off. I think we need to take Dennis out. You think? Yes! And there's only one way to do it. What's that? You don't want to do this, bro. Oh, I think I do, buddy. 'Cause I got the moves that are gonna make me number one. Why don't you just go with the best dancer? Hit it. If I were you I'd take precaution Before I step to meet my girl Oh, goddamn it! Well, glad that's settled. I think I'm gonna go get in that chick's pants now. I thought they were engaged, dude. "Engaged. " That's just a word. It doesn't mean anything. It means they're getting married. Married, engaged. They're just words, you know? My parents were married and engaged once. You saw how that worked out. I'm gonna go bang that chick. Enjoy wearing that keg for the rest of the competition. Yeah. Yeah, that's good. Looking a little stiff there, partner. Want me to give you a couple pointers? That's okay. Come on, man. Let me show you some moves. He's just trying to help. All right, fine. Yeah? All right, here we go. I'm gonna pretend like you're Gloria, okay? Now, you're not nearly as beautiful as she is, but I can use my imagination. What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna teach you how to dip her. That's really important. I'm gonna put my arm around your waist just like that. Don't stop. Keep moving. We don't want you out of the competition, right? No! Then I'm gonna bend my knees and dip you down real low. My goodness! What happened? You lost your grip? You dropped me on purpose, asshole! Calm down, Robert. It's perfectly natural to blame the teacher at first. We're all feeling a little tired. You son of a bitch! Robert, stop. Come on. It was an accident. Oh, come on! Let's get out of here! Wait a second. Gloria, you've come this far. You don't want to stop now. Wow. Butt out, man. This is none of your business. Now come on, honey! We came here to win. We need this! Wow. He's a violent guy. I know. I hate it when he gets like that. Gotta be careful with that one. Goddamn it. I feel your pain, Mac. We all do. What the hell's going on out here? We're making brownies. The drug filled kind. Shut up, Cricket! What's he talking about, Frank? They're filled with sedatives. You want to help me distribute them? I'll make you my number two. You're not even in the contest anymore, bro. I certainly am. I have an inside horse. You see this homeless gentleman? He wins, I win. Come on, Mac. Join our crew. Shut up, you goddamn street rat! Keep working! You are on your way out. So you might as well go out with a bang and have some insurance. Okay, I'm in. But I don't know how much longer I can last here. This thing's killing my back. I'll come up with a rig. Definitely. Shut up, street rat. Wow. He's getting pretty close to that pretty girl, huh? Yeah. You gotta make him jealous. I don't want to make him jealous. I want to win your bar. Oh. Okay. How do you think I could make him jealous? I'll tell you exactly what you need to do. See that homeless guy? You gotta dance with him. That doesn't make any sense. It makes sense. You're tired. I am, but I don't see how that makes sense. Okay, it's reverse psychology. No, it's not. You know what? I'm his sister. I know him really well. I know him a lot better than you. The only way you're gonna be able to land Dennis is by making him feel he's lower on your list than a disgusting, filthy homeless guy. I'm gonna go grind a homeless guy. Good girl. Make it dirty. Oh, my God! She's really, like, grinding away over there! Eat your heart out, Dennis Reynolds! Hey. Hey, pretty lady? Look, can you do me a favor? Can you prop your leg up and, like, grind on me all sexual like? Charlie's over there blowing up my spot with that girl. Oh, yeah. He is blowing up your spot. I know. Better make some moves to get her back. I'm gonna make some moves like a ranked number two guy would. You're number two. What's up, bitches? Oh! Why are you dancing so strangely? Because of all my energy. I got tons of energy now because of this. Energy bar. Have some. Looks like a shit ball. No! That's an energy bar! Why is it so heavy and big? Because it's filled with vitamins and shit. Come on, guys. Just eat it and you'll have a burst of energy. Trust me. Don't eat it, Dee! It's filled with cough medicine. I love you! You traitor bastard! Okay, that's it, Cricket. You're out of the crew. You're my whole life. I love you. I ain't going out without a fight! Don't leave me in the sun. I'll burn. You are in cahoots with those guys? I'm not in cahoots with anybody! You've been cahooting with them! I have not been cahooting! You're wearing Rickety Cricket's exoskeleton right now! I am not! Yes, you are! Okay! Okay! So I'm wearing it. You are pathetic. Oh, am I, Dee? Is this pathetic? What are you doing, bro? What, man? A man can't enjoy a sexual lady? Not when it's with my partner. I'm cutting in. Get out of here! Back off! I need her, man! Why do you need her? I need her, all right? Just put it that way. You leave me no choice, Charlie. Hey, asshole. Whatever. Wanna dance? Yes! Good. Good, good. Take a load off. Let these strong, sweet, sexual arms hold you. So strong. I gotcha. So strong. All right, night-night. No! You made me do that. You piece of shit. Yeah, maybe. You piece of shit! Dennis Reynolds, I trusted you! Why? You are the biggest piece of shit on the planet! That's it. I'm taking this one out. I'm going limp. No, Charlie. Don't go limp. I got you, Gloria. You're hurting me! Charlie, don't do this. He's trying to have sex with you. What? I'm not gonna have sex with you! What do you mean? I'm engaged! Engaged is just a word. It doesn't have any meaning. No, it's a very serious word. Thank you! I was getting somewhere, wasn't I? No, you weren't. Really? No! All right. Well, see you later. You really are the biggest piece of shit on the planet. You still talking to me? I thought you were out. Dick! Don't worry, ma'am, 'cause I'm about to take this sucker out! You're gonna take me out? You bet. How are you gonna do that? This right here. DJ Fat Michael! Yo! Squirrely D? Oh, yeah! Please play my dance for a dance challenge. That's a cando, my brother. Let me tell you a lesson. The cream always rises to the top. And I'm about to show you the white-hot cream of an eighth-grade boy. Oh, my God. Play the tape. You gotta be kidding me. Watching every motion In my foolish lovers game On this endless ocean Finally lovers know no shame It was like a ballet. How did he remember that choreography? It was 20 years ago. I don't know. It was beautiful, man. What's going on, monkeys? Yeah. How are those kegs treating ya? Pretty good. What you munching on, pal? Energy ball, courtesy of my partner here. You look pretty woozy there, buddy. I'm feeling woozy What is it? Wait. What is up, man? I feel like I'm tripping. Oh, Charlie, that might be the cough medicine. You got about 15 minutes until you drop like a ton of bricks. Holy shit! Did you play me? Oh, I played you. I played you good. Maybe now you two jerks might want to start treating me with a little respect. Why would we show you respect? Yeah, why? Because I masterminded this entire situation. Not only did I get Charlie to eat a drug filled brownie I got everybody in here to do it. Pretty soon, people are gonna be dropping like flies, and it's gonna be me and you two jerks. Good luck with those kegs, boners. Bitch! There is enough cough medicine in there to kill a gorilla. If you keep eating it, you're not gonna last five minutes. Bro, I can handle my sedatives. I cannot believe how long Charlie has lasted after eating that brownie. Karate snow machine chop set What's with the chopping? I'm chopping all over my action. And mostly power. He's lost his damn mind. My back's killing me. Break me off a piece of that exoskeleton. It doesn't work that way. You can't just break off a piece of an exoskeleton. Give me some of that liquid hydraulic shit! No, man! Hey! It's a sensitive science! Don't use your elbows! Whoa! Whoa! Dennis, what are you doing? Oh, goddamn it! Ohh! Double whammy! Are you happy? Dee's gonna win. No. We still got Charlie. Don't worry about it. I got an inside horse Larry. That's my inside horse. Larry! Stay awake! Go, Larry! He's staying up! Come on, Larry! You can do It! You can do It, Larry! You feeling bad? That's too bad. 'Cause I'm just getting my second wind. Cricket! Now! Here I come, Dee! I love you so much! Oh, my God, my knee! Oh, my God! Larry! You won the bar for us! Larry wins! Whoo! All right, Larry! I have a shattered kneecap! Dee, we can start again. Right? Never talk to me again, you goddamn street rat! Look on the bright side, Deandra. At least you're not ranked last anymore. Who's last now? Charlie. That kid really needs to learn how to read.                     What the shit is this? Uh, Cheech over here bought himself a bong. Deandra, this is wacky. Go download me a hoagie off the Internet. I'm sorry? Those words don't make any s- sense. Oh, God, you guys. Oh, weird, I feel weird.
 Rip another one.
 Yeah, say something else stupid, too. My arm's kind of numb. Dennis, can you feel my head? Am I hot?
 I'm not touching you.
 We're enjoying ourselves over here. I'm serious, you guys. Something's not right.
 There's pigeons in the bar.
 I feel Pigeons in the bar. I'm being really serious, you guys, I need some he Good one.
 What is her problem?
 I don't know.
 So heart attack.
 Yeah, yikes. Yeah, that's what I was trying to say. And the EMT says basically I'm like a ticking time bomb at this point 'cause it was just a little one. I didn't know women could have heart attacks. You know, what's scary about this whole thing, really, is that I have the same genes as her. I'm concerned for myself and Charlie as well. We lead a very rock-and-roll lifestyle. I know. I just had a heart attack. Can we focus on me for two minutes here?
 I feel like we did talk about you.
 Dee, your ship has sailed. Okay, it's time to move on to us, the people who are going to live on. Guys, we got to make sure that this does not happen to us. That's the important thing here. We need to focus on ourselves
 Ms. Reynolds?
 Doctor, thank God. Listen, let's just do all the tests you've got, okay? I feel like the big one's right around the corner. Well, actually, Ms. Reynolds, first we need to discuss how you'll be paying for your stay. Paying? This is a hospital.
 Since when do you pay to stay in a hospital?
 Since always. Uh, no, I believe that is what taxes are for. Yeah, you don't pay a fireman to put out a fire. Or a cop to shoot a guy or How do you not know how this works? You've been in a hospital before. I guess I must have slipped through the cracks. I do always give a fake name 'cause I like to stay off the grid. They usually just give me a bunch of antibiotics,
 the sores go away, and I walk out.
 Shut up.
 Doctor, I have health insurance.
 Yeah, we're on our father's policy. You guys, check out this cool gown. Really lets your ass breathe.
 Oh, my God.
 Son of a bitch. Why are you wearing that thing, dude? I'm getting a full-body scan. I've been partying real hard lately. Whatever. She needs to see the insurance card. I canceled that shit when you were nine.
 You canceled our insurance policy?
 What? What, am I gonna carry that burden around? You couldn't have given us a heads-up about that a long time ago? Okay, let me get this straight. Ms. Reynolds, you have no health insurance?
 No, I don't.
 Okay. Well, get out. Harsh. Why is the government not providing us with health insurance? I mean, what is this, like some kind of socialist country or some kind of communist dictatorship? This is insane, this is un American. You don't pay for health insurance. That's crazy. All I know is we need to find insurance ASAP. Oh, my God, we're going to get sick eventually. So we just find a couple of side jobs, right? That way we'll have insurance, and when disaster inevitably occurs, we'll be covered.
 We'll be covered.
 Okay, here we go. "Position available. Major sales corporation. Motivated individuals. Good interpersonal skills". You don't have to say anymore. That's us, that is us. "Salary and benefits". Jesus. Why are you still wearing that thing, dude?
 Did you wear that all the way here?
 I let my ass breathe. You keep saying that, but I don't know what it means. Yeah, how does an ass breathe? Explain that to me.
 How does a?
 Just leave me alone, okay?! I can't get worked up. My doctor told me not to get worked up. I'm under too much stress. Yeah That's a lot of pills, dude. Yeah, that's the beauty of having insurance. You can get the top-quality anti-anxiety drugs. Wow, you got a lot of 'em, huh?
 What are you doing?
 I'm taking 'em because I can't sift through the duds. I got to take 'em all because I got to get healthy really fast.
 You're taking 'em all at once?
 Yeah.
 I don't think that's a good idea.
 It seems a bit aggressive to me. I know what I'm doing! Oh, this is great, Dee. This is perfect. I mean, getting in shape is like the best health insurance you can get. Yeah, you take care of your body, you don't need a doctor. I want that. That's exactly right, yeah. You look good, you feel good.
 It's all connected, baby.
 It's connected. You're talking about the mind- body-abs connection. I would personally like to
 get some side abs going.
 You want to get some side abs? That's a good idea. You know what I'm concerned about?
 I don't want to get too bulky.
 Right. I want to stay nice and lean and tight. I want to get that Jesus-on-the-cross look. I think that crucifixion must have been really good for your core because Absolutely. Jesus had, like, the best abs. He had the right idea.
 Hey, he knew: no pain, no gain.
 He had good messages. I'm sure he started that. All right, well, let's do some cardio since we're here. Yeah, here we are. Let's, uh, let's get our blood pumping. Let's hop on these treadmills and, uh, you know, let's do this thing.
 Let's do it.
 All right.
 I don't know if I'm ready.
 I'm not feeling ready. Uh, I'll tell you why. I feel a little low-energy. That's what it is. We need to fuel up. Now, I see people utilizing a lot of shakes and powders around here.
 We should probably look into that.
 We should do that. You know what else we should do? Get some new outfits. Let's get some new outfits. That's a great idea. You decided to rock jeans, for instance. I'm confused by that. Yeah, uh, I chose jeans. I'm not seeing a lot of other jeans
 I've never seen jeans in a gym.
 Okay, well, look, that's fine. This is what we'll do. We'll dial it back. We'll get fueled up, we'll get some sick new outfits, and then we'll come back and work out. Let's go. "Official rÃ©sumÃ©*** of Mac and Charlie". So both of you are Well, gentlemen, I've never seen two people share a resume before. Well, we thought we'd save paper. You know, go green. Uh, "Work experience: Paddy's Pub management"? And duties that include "ordering supplies and taking care of business". T.C.O.B. Uh, "Business coordinator for several year"-- I don't know who this is.
 Coordinator.
 Okay. "For several years, I've been in complete charge of pretty much everything in my life."
 I don't miss a beat.
 That would actually be him. Uh, not-- pretty much everything. There's certain things that you just can't have control of, sir. I think you'll find that what we lack in formal education, we more than make up for in street smarts. Okay, so we can wheel, we can deal, we can oversee hostile takeovers.
 Whatever you need, bud.
 You name it. It's a mailroom gig, and there's only one spot available. Kind of a package deal. We sort of work as a team. I'll tell you what. What if we split the pay right down the middle?
 You'd be willing to do that?
 Oh, yeah. Yeah, this has nothing to do with money. This is sort of a health insurance situation for us so, you know, frankly, you don't even really have to pay us at all. Legally, I have to pay you something, but, uh,
 minimum wage maybe?
 Minimum wage? Are you kidding me?
 That's great.
 Absolutely. That's a government salary right there, yeah. Well, you drive a hard bargain. The job is both of yours.
 Congratulations.
 Congratulations to you.
 Bro.
 Minimum wage. Minimum wage. Fat burner? Well, I'm already on a nitric oxide energy stack, but yeah, sure, I'll take some fat burner-- why not? All right, everybody. Before we begin today, are there any physical ailments that I should know about first?
 Uh, yeah, I just had a heart attack.
 Excuse me? I just had a heart attack. Maybe you should turn this techno music down. Yeah, I got to be honest, buddy, I'm not really feeling these tunes.
 Boom, there we go.
 Hey, what are you doing? I'm rifling through your music, and it's pretty terrible.
 Yeah, you know what, put it down.
 Does he have any '80s? Doesn't appear to. No, it seems like he's got a bunch of goddamn dance mixes. Hang on. It's all good. I got a Steve Winwood CD in my car. I'll just go out and grab that. Okay, listen, don't do that. Please don't do that.
 Why, what's wrong with Steve Winwood?
 Yeah, man, "Higher Love"? It's a classic. Listen, I pick the music in this class, okay? Oh, no, no, no. I apologize. I had no idea that this was all about you. First of all, I don't think you should even be here if you just had a heart attack, ma'am. Well, maybe you shouldn't dress like a bumblebee, bitch. You just dogged, bro. You just got dogged. Guys, please leave my class. Spin class. A bunch of hamsters on a wheel. I'm gonna ride a bike hard, I'm gonna ride a bike fast and oh, yeah, I'm not gonna go anywhere. And then when I walk out, I'm gonna put a bunch of metal onto a metal bar and lift that metal over and over like a metal jerk. You know, I got to be honest with you. I feel like these supplements are doing a great job on their own, you know what I mean? I've got tons of energy. My heart rate's up. Things are going great. Absolutely. I feel good, too. Look how vascular I am. Look at how my veins are popping. I look good, and I feel good. I feel good, too, apart from the recent bouts of explosive diarrhea. Been having diarrhea?
 Oh, God, all over the place.
 Really? You know what that is? That's probably your body flushing out all the toxins.
 You think so?
 I do think so. I, on the other hand, have not taken a shit in days.
 Days?
 Days.
 That doesn't sound good.
 Oh, no, it's good. My body's working at 100% efficiency, yeah. My body is absorbing every single nutrient, and it's not wasting a single thing. Your body's taking its job very seriously. My body is doing its job like it's never done before. Okay, we're gonna start climbing just a little more. Why don't we up the supplements, which we know work, and eliminate working out, which we know blows? That sounds like a pretty good plan. You know what, I'm gonna take it one step further and propose that we start working on a muscle that we've been neglecting this entire time. And it's the most important muscle in the entire body. Which muscle? The face. That's a gift for you, bumblebee.
 Come on.
 Enjoy it, Coach Dick and Balls. Mr. Taylor whose grandpa was a sailor. There you go, Mr. Scott who drinks his coffee hot. There it is. Mr. White whose wife is not too bright, there you go. Come on, dude, I'm trying to network by the water cooler. Yeah, and I'm doing both of our jobs here, so you want to help out? Okay, the mail doesn't stop down there, Mac. I need help. All right, this is Felix's pile. He receives for Eric. He receives for Janet. Don't ever look Janet in the eye because she's a horrible devil woman. I feel like you are taking this shit way too seriously. Will you just help me out, man? This is Johnson's mail, okay? Now, Johnson's gone AWOL for the week with the wife and kids down in Orlando, so I want you to keep a pile in a neat stack somewhere that's all Johnson's mail. Oh, wait a second. This guy's in Orlando for the week? Yeah, man, come on, help me out here. Oh, hold on a second, bro. This is the perfect opportunity. I'm gonna hang out in his office and pretend I'm the new guy. I don't think that's gonna work, dude. Have you seen The Secret of My Success? They're gonna catch on to you. Yeah, but before they do, I will come up with an idea that will save the company millions, and they'll be forced to promote me. Are you sure? How does that movie end, dude? I can't rember. He bangs that old lady, and then they play that song from the '80s. "Day Bow Bow." What the hell is "Day Bow Bow"? No, Mac, seriously Beautiful. At least give him his mail. Jesus Christ, dude, what's going on in here? I'm really behind the eight ball, Mac. The mail doesn't stop, bud.
 You're smoking now?
 Yeah, I'm smoking now. You kidding me? My nerves are like So I'm trying to smoke. I'm trying to calm myself down, and hey, we got insurance, so what the hell, I can smoke. Maybe you're right 'cause I need to calm my nerves a bit, dude. It's a shark tank up there. Oh, yeah, is it? I bet. Have some coffee, too. That will calm you down. What's your system here, bro? It's pretty complicated. The mail goes into three sections according to how important I think the thing looks, okay? Now, the least important stuff, I'm gonna burn that. If it's important, they're gonna send it again, right? The middle important stuff, I put that back in the mail addressed to me so I buy myself a couple more days. And the most important stuff, that gets delivered, although, you know something, Mac, I actually burn that, too, most of the time. Okay, well, it looks like you've got this under control. I'm gonna get back to my office.
 All right, bud, all right.
 Yeah, no, I'm just I'm
 The mail doesn't stop!
 Okay, sorry, buddy. All right, I'm gonna get back to my office, and then You know, I'll see you later. All right, man. Okay, bud. You're not gonna stop, are you? Come on, man, hit me. Come on, hit me again. Come on. Look. I found him wandering the streets. No ID, no nothing. Figure we turn him over to you until someone claimed him.
 Poor thing.
 Careful. I think he crapped himself. This way. Right through here. Hit me, hit me again. Hit me. Hello? Hi. Who is this? This is Mac. I'm the new guy. What are you doing in my office? Who are you, and why are you in my office? Who is this? This is Johnson. I thought you were in Orlando. I am in Orlando. I'm trying to check my voicemail. I can check it for you. No, don't just What is your name, sir? Why don't you just give me your name? Your full name, sir. Oh, this is going to be great, sis. I mean, we already got the mind, body and soul going. Now all we need is to get our faces nice and tight, and we'll be healthy as all hell. I know. Now, you're clear on these instructions, right? Yeah, yeah, I think so. You know what you're doing? They're in Spanish. Yeah, but you know, if you know Latin, you know, like, three languages, so As far as I know, you don't speak Latin. I don't speak Latin, but there's pictures in here, so I think we're good. So you're good with the pictures then? Can we get going with this, though? 'Cause those supplements are giving me the squirts like you would not believe. Oh, man, I would kill for your bowel movements right now. I am so blocked up. I'm gonna do your eyes first,
 so hold really still.
 Easy, easy. Seriously, do not move.
 It's in?
 It's out.
 It's out?
 I did it.
 It's out, and it's in.
 Pretty good, right? Painless. Great. Let's just let that settle for a minute, and I'll Think about what I would like to do. Number one, I'd like to get rid of these crow's feet that I have been noticing coming in, which I do not appreciate. And hear me out on this one. It's a little weird. I'm thinking about doing something to my earlobes. I've never really liked my earlobes. Jesus! What? How's that eye feel? Oh, it feels a little weird. I'm having a little trouble seeing out of it.
 That's normal, right?
 I don't think so. It's not? Really? God, now that you mention it, sis, I do feel a fair amount of pain coming on. God, it stings. Shit, Dennis, I think maybe I switched these up. You switched 'em up?
 I don't know. I'm thinking
 What the hell! Maybe I put some collagen in your eye. You injected Mexican collagen in my eye?! Sorry. I can't handle the stress you're giving me right now. My heart is very weak. It's a lot of pressure. Oh, God, I think I'm going blind in one eye. Well, hold on a second. I feel very weird. I'm going blind. I feel like my heart might explode. Are you feeling better today? I like to hear that. Now take your medication. Good. That's good. Hello, Chief. They're onto me, dude. Those guys are sharp as nails up there. You can't put anything past them. Oh, my God, dude, I'm freaking out. I am so stressed out. I feel like I'm having a panic attack. You want to talk about stress? You want to talk about stress?! Okay? I've stumbled onto a major company conspiracy, Mac. How about that for stress? What the hell are you talking about? This company is being bled like a stuck pig, Mac, and I got a paper trail to prove it. Check this out. Take a look at this.
 Jesus Christ, Charlie.
 That right there is the mail. Now, let's talk about the mail. Can we talk about the mail, please, Mac? I've been dying to talk about the mail with you all day, okay? Pepe Silvia This name keeps coming up over and over again. Every day, Pepe's mail's getting sent back to me. I look in the mail. This whole box is Pepe Silvia. So, I say to myself, I got to find this guy. I got to go up to his office. I got to put his mail in the guy's goddamn hands. Otherwise he's never gonna get it. He's gonna keep coming back down here, so I go up to Pepe's office, and what do I find out? What do I find out?! There is no Pepe Silvia. The man does not exist, okay? So, I decide, "Oh, shit, buddy. I got to dig a little deeper." There's no Pepe Silvia. You got to be kidding me. I got boxes full of Pepe! All right, so I start marching my way down to Carol in HR, and I knock on her door, and I say, Carol, I got to talk to you about Pepe." And when I open the door, what do I find? There's not a single, goddamn desk in that office. There is no Carol in HR. Mac, half the employees in this building have been made up. This office is a goddamn ghost town. Okay, Charlie, I'm gonna have to stop you right there. Not only do all of these people exist, but they have been asking for their mail on a daily basis. It's all they're talking about up there. Jesus Christ, dude, we are going to lose our jobs. Well, calm down, 'cause here's one thing that's not gonna happen. What? We're not gonna get fired. We're not? 'Cause we've already been fired. We've lost our jobs?! About three days ago, a couple of pink slips came in the mail. One for you and one for me. So what did I do? I mailed them halfway to Siberia, okay? Charlie, if we've lost our jobs, that means we've lost our health insurance, which means all of this was for nothing. Goddamn it, dude. I'm having a panic attack. I am actually having a panic attack. Oh, will you settle down and have another cup of coffee? I am, bro.
 All right, well, fine.
 You know what, Barney? Give this guy a cigarette. He's freaking out. Who? Barney. He's the guy who tipped me off to Pepe Silvia. Barney?! Who the hell is Barney?! You don't see Bar? Oh, shit, where the hell did he? You've lost your mind. You've lost your goddamn mind, Charlie. Jesus Christ, dude, will you forget the mail, all right? Forget the mail? The mail's the most important thing in the world now. Dude, you're gonna give me another panic attack.
 You have a cigarette?
 I hear Barney. Where's Barney, huh? How long is the wait at this place?! We have been here for hours and hours. Goddamn Frank. Where the hell is he? Shit! Where am I? Tonto Come here. Come on, bub, let's go. Get up. You got to help me out here. Pick this up and throw it through this window. Pick throw. That's it. That's it. One Two and three. Beautiful. Come on. Let's get the hell out of here. Come on. You go first.                     He really has an ugly face. He is certainly ugly. But, you know what, that's not really what bothers me about this. What bothers me is that he looks like an old woman.
 Right!
 Yeah. Well, he is wearing a lot of blush on those cheekbones, but I feel like that was the look of the times. No, no, but it's not just that though, Mac, it's not. I mean, a lot of presidents somehow end up looking like women. I mean, look at Ronald Reagan, right? Now, why would you hang a painting like this on your wall? Well, it's the Historical Society, bro. They have to hang it up. Oh, well, we got to suffer just because some old dude who looks like Meryl Streep chopped down a cherry tree, like, ten million years ago? It's just, he looks terrible! You know what? Let's take it down. It's just gonna distract us through the meeting.
 Yeah, let's get it down, man.
 Let's take it down. It's not gonna work. It's just gonna distract us. Unbelievable. It's bolted to the wall. Well, that proves our point, man. We're not the first people to try and take that thing down. Yeah, but we're gonna be the first ones to actually succeed.
 Come on, let's tear it down, Charlie.
 Let's just rip it off the wall, man.
 Rip it right off the wall.
 Whoa, guys, guys, guys. I got a pocketknife. Just cut it out of the frame. That's a good idea. 'Cause I really, I've had enough of this dude.
 Just cut it right out of the frame.
 What are you doing?
 Do you want this up?
 Yes. Yes, I do. Uh, may I help you gentlemen with something? Yeah, yeah. Actually, we're here because we want to get our bar certified as a historic landmark. We want tourists to be able to come by Paddy's Pub as part of the walking tour of Philly. You know, they can come by, suck up some history, do some shots, get blasted. In order to be considered as a historical site, your bar would have to have some historical significance. Well, trust us when we tell you that Paddy's Pub played an extremely important part in history. Mm, and what, uh, part of history might that be? The cracking of the Liberty Bell, of course. So you're claiming that your bar had a direct role in the cracking of the Liberty Bell?
 Absolutely.
 Well, then tell me about it. Well, the year was
 No. Really?
 Let Dennis, let Dennis
 Let me tell the story, Charlie.
 Okay. The year was 1776. And Paddy's Pub, then known, of course, as Patrick's Pub, was a hotbed of revolutionary activity. Revolutionaries from all over the country had come together to gather at Patrick's Pub to speak of war and revolution. Will you look at that? Sons of Liberty. Patriots meeting in our bar, speaking of revolution and freedom. Can you believe it, dear brother? We're witnessing history in the making. I do not give a shit, Deandra. Now, get me a flagon of ale. Get your own ale, dick. You are my slave. You have to get me flagons of ale. I saved you from being burned at the stake for being a witch. You're the one who accused me of being a witch in the first place, Dennis. Well, what's done is done. That's all in the past now. So you can either be a slave witch in the bar, or you can be a burned up witch outside. Up to you! Flagon of ale now? Guys, guys, guys, I've got some news! I've got some terrible news!
 Oh, MacDonald, how goes it?
 Not good. You know that chick I've been banging down at Independence Hall?
 Mm, the fat one.
 She's not that fat. Yeah, she's pretty fat, dude. Good one, witch. Well, whatever. She told me in complete confidence that a bunch of old dudes down there are drafting a declaration-- a declaration of independence. Wait, why would we want to be free from the British? This declaration is gonna start an all-out war. We have to make sure we are not on the losing side.
 Definitely.
 Okay, clearly the British are gonna win this thing.
 Clearly.
 All right, we have to make sure that the Crown knows that we're on their side. We have to make our own declaration. Yes. Yes, we need to make a declaration of dependence. Buy a pelt here! We have raccoon, we have foxes! Ho, there, sir. Now, my good gentleman, what says you of my fine furs here? Merrily I be able to guide you toward some interest in some purchase. I can't understand what you're saying.
 You want to buy a fur?
 Yeah. In July? No, thanks. Not so fast now. That's a nice looking cart of pumpkins you got here. Uh, what says you we maketh some trade, hmm?
 All my furs for all your pumpkins.
 No. All right, aye-aye-aye-aye- aye-aye-aye-aye! One pumpkin.
 Deal.
 All righty! Wait, wait, wait, whoa, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie. We're not traders, Charlie. We're thieves. You want his pumpkins, we kill him and take his pumpkins. This is 1776. We'll get away with it!
 I can hear you.
 Yeah, all right, very good. This is how it will go down. I will beat the man about the face and the neck and maybe the chest area and possibly the groin until he's no longer consisting of life pulse. And then you can collect up the man's cart. I shall findeth a stick. Yes! Well, we'll need a stick to do the bashing. Sit tight, sir. Pick a stick, any stick you like. All right, well, methinks the rod to be the most suitable for our purposes. Ah, very nice rod. Go with that rod. Okey dokey dokey do. Uh-oh! He's gone. What? He stole our furs! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
 You shit head.
 Hey, look on the bright side, Franklin. We got ourselves a pumpkin. This is gonna work. I can't believe you dressed like that, bro. Um, excuse me, this is a good plan, okay? If we're gonna get this declaration into the hands of the queen, we need to dress the part. It's not the way the British dress, bro.
 They dress like this.
 No, British commoners dress like you're dressed-- British peons, okay? I'm dressed like a nobleman, okay? These people respond to royalty. Hey, guys, come on. Please help. Just use your witch strength, slave. Yeah, it's not that much further. God! Uh, pardon me, pardon me, good sirs. But which of you gentlemen happens to be the highest ranking military officer here? That would be me. Cricket. Colonel Cricket. What is your business, sirs? Ah, well, Colonel, we are the owners of the fine local establishment Patrick's Pub. Patrick's Pub! Yes, of course, of course. The liberty bar.
 You harbor patriots.
 Oh, whoops, no, no, no.
 No.
 No, myth.
 Myth.
 Bad intel there. Yeah, bad intel. Bit of a miscommunication. Actually, that is why we're here. Uh, we drew up this declaration. We also included an illustration that we had hoped would illuminate our intentions towards the queen, huh? This appears to be a rendering of the two of you sodomizing the king whilst the queen is forced to witness.
 Oh, no!
 Goodness gracious, no! No, look. I'm holding homeboy's arms back. Dennis is ready to jam him in the face,
 and the queen is impressed.
 Yeah, that's a bad guy, that's not the king.
 Uh, we're doing bad stuff to the bad
 Give me this.
 You know, you don't get it.
 Let's get the ale. The ale. Wench, now, the ale, presenteth it. Okay, set that down in front of him. And, uh, yes, good Colonel, we present this ale to you and your men in hopes that it will fuel the British to victory. Madam.
 Whoa! Hey!
 What the hell you doing? Get out of here! You're making a big mess! Get back to the bar!
 I'm really sorry. That was huge!
 Yeah. That's That hit you right in the face, didn't it? You know what? We don't condone that sort of thing, okay? We're going to tar and feather the shit out of her when she gets back. Don't worry. Don't worry. I pray you, who is that fiery wench? Her? Oh, that's just my sister Deandra.
 She's a slave.
 Yeah. And a witch. Yeah. You keep your sister as your slave? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Aye. So are we good here now? What's the deal? Gentlemen, you have both proven to me in the very short time that I've known you that you are both slanderous perverts lacking any semblance of moral fortitude. However, I do desire to seek further counsel with the lady. Uh lady? Oh, the the witch! The same girl we've just been talking about? You don't really think she's a a witch, do you?
 Yeah. Yeah, she's a witch.
 Yeah. I'm pretty sure. Pretty sure. All right, look. I wish to court her in some manner, and I could use your help because I'm not, admittedly, very good with women. Good with women? You mean good at women? Like, you can't catch them when they run away from you? Bro, it's 1776. They don't have any rights. You can just take them and force them to do whatever you want. I do not wish to take her. I would like to win her favor, like a gentleman does a lady.
 That just does not compute with me.
 I don't understand what you're saying. Digging the accent, but don't understand you.
 Are you saying you're gay?
 All right, escort them out! Oh, no. We we Okay. Are you going to drink the beer?
 No, leave it. Out.
 Just drink the beer. Maybe you'll get some balls and you can take the woman.
 Fire!
 Ready?
 Yes. Shoot.
 All right. One, two, three. Do not shoot that pumpkin! What are you doing? I stole a bunch of guns! I'm testing them out, Charles! This revolution is going to make us a fortune! All right. Well, leave the pumpkin out of it.
 The pumpkin's innocent!
 Shoot the pumpkin.
 Do not shoot the pumpkin please.
 Okay.
 Give me the gun.
 Fine. Why is the witch lady shooting at you anyway?
 Maybe she used her sorcery.
 Sorcery? Your dumb-dick partner walked into the bar and said he stole a bunch of guns and asked if I wanted to shoot a pumpkin off his head, and of course I did, so here we are.
 Damn your necromancy, woman!
 No, I'm not. Maybe, if we shoot you, you won't feel it anyway, witch. You know what, okay, you guys. I tell you what, you win. I'm a witch, okay? I'm a witch! And I curse both of you and all of your stupid guns. Charlie, goddamn it!
 Give me that gun.
 She cursed the gun! She cursed the gun. She put a curse on the gun! Let's try this one. Nothing! Try on me. Damn those Sons of Liberty sons of bitches, Dennis. Those guys are going to get us in so much trouble.
 Let's do this.
 No, no, no, no!
 You hang back.
 What? Me? Why? Because, dude, we need to get as much intel from these guys as we possibly can for that Colonel Cricket. This fop thing is going to totally blow our cover. What's going on with your mouth?
 Oh, I got some wooden teeth put in.
 Did you? Yeah. Well, all the patriots are doing it, including Washington, which is why it makes sense, okay, if we're going undercover!
 Not this fop bullshit!
 No, the fop thing's good, man. I got a plan with it. Yeah. I got an angle. Fine. Okay, listen.
 You let me take the lead, okay?
 Yeah. Okay.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
 You son of a bitch. Fellas! How you doing? A couple of flagons of ale for you! So I just want to say, we love what you're doing over here. I mean, taxation with representation, right? So, uh what's the buzz, huh? What are we all talking about, huh? Surrender, maybe?
 We speak of revolution.
 Revolution? Revolution! That's great! I'm completely on top of that! Hey, fellas, who's taking the minutes here? 'Cause I feel like I could be an asset to you as a secretary, and-- Let's start by taking down all of their names.
 First and last, please.
 Son of a bitch. Gentlemen, I think this meeting is adjourned. You stupid son of a bitch, dude! What are you doing with the accent and the British? Goddamn it! Yeah. No, no, no. I just decided to go a different way.
 The spy thing wasn't really working.
 Yeah? What way was that? Well, your wooden teeth whistly-tooth thing? That was bad.
 That wasn't working.
 My teeth were a smashing success. We are in dire straits here, okay? We need a change of plan. I think the only way we're going to convince these people that we're on their side is to become 100% British.
 To become British?
 We gotta commit to the fop thing. That actually seems pretty sensible, Dennis. No more "S's" for you. It's just so cramped in here. I mean, you'd think people who came here so many years before the English, that they'd build bigger houses! Yeah. You'd think they'd have huge homes. What is the sleeping situation in here? You think this father and son are sleeping on the same bearskin together? Probably. Where else they going to sleep? What a bunch of losers! I'm telling you, a bunch of inbred savages. I speak English. Oh, shit! For real? Yes. Oh, that's not good. We didn't mean to Our bad. Uh, just tell me. How much land are you going to give away for a pumpkin these days? Charlie Charlie, listen. What we need is your magical powers to lift the curses from our guns.
 Gag-ga da boom.
 Okay?
 We're going to pay you.
 Oh, yeah. We gotta pay you. We'll give you this. We brought this for you.
 Booze! Right?
 Booze. Makes you feel good. Helps you sleep. Brings the tribe together. You want me to scalp them? That young Indian was fast with the tomahawk! He really lobbed a big hunk off your head up here. He's going to make me look deformed! Yeah. And you're going to be deformed for the rest of your life. Give me that skunk pelt. I'll use it for hair.
 Don't push! Don't push!
 All right.
 It's look cool.
 It looks pretty good.
 Lady Deandra?
 Yes? Can I help you? Colonel Cricket. We met the other day I was the one you delivered the keg to
 You spit in my face.
 Oh! Yep. Yep. There it is. Indeed. Forgive my rather unadorned approach, but from the first moment I laid my eyes on you I was smitten. Perhaps my impatience has gotten the best of me, but if you will have me, I would be most honored to call you my wife. A simple "no" would have sufficed. Okay, all right, that one got in my mouth. That's really not cool. You listen to me, you pale-faced English dickhole, you got a revolution coming. And pretty soon, all of the slaves are gonna be free, and I will be owned by no man.
 I am a fool
 Yeah. having allowed myself to imagine us back in my sprawling manor in England. You on my arm, adorned in magnificent garments, dressed in the finest jewels. Cricks, back it up a little bit. You talking about garments and jewelry? But alas, my love cannot mend our differences. Oh, no-no-no, wait-wait-wait-wait! Your love, your love can. Your love is, your love is currently doing that, so You didn't mention anything about the sprawling manor and all the garments.
 That was stupid.
 But I-I thought that you just said Yeah, I did, I did, I did, but it's your love, it's, like, filling me up with all kinds of stuff.
 Is it?
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, it is!
 Let's do this! Let's get married!
 What?
 Oh, Lady Deandra
 Yes! you have made me the happiest man alive! We're gonna have to work up to that, though, 'cause you are crazy ugly. Keep your pants on, curly. You want the slave, you gotta pay for the slave.
 What?
 I'm sorry. We're not gonna give it to you for free. You gotta sweeten the pot, eh?
 How'd you like to buy some guns?
 Yes. Guns?
 I shall buy your guns.
 Yes!
 I shall buy your guns!
 No-no-no-no-no, not yet. Hey, hey-hey, hey. Why does he keep spitting in my mouth? Who is this man? Ah, hello to you, sirs, and to you, ladies. These heels are almost impossible to walk in. Well, get over it, dude. You gotta walk in 'em, okay? Now let me hear the voice. No, I don't think that the voice is entirely necessary, so I'm not gonna do it. If we're gonna wipe away all traces of our colonial background and blend in with British culture, we need to walk the walk
 and we need to talk the talk.
 Fine. How do you do it? Your voice needs to come off as elegant (with English accent): as your clothing, okay? So try this. Would you like a spot of tea? You-- "Yeeees!" Would you like a spot of tea? Ye-es.
 Draw it out more.
 Draw it out more than that? Yees! Yees! That's good. Those wooden teeth are killing me. That lisp is stupid. I think the wooden teeth are the whole thing that's saving this thing.
 You sound ridiculous, dude.
 No, I don't. It sounds pretty good. I'm not losing the teeth. Let's just move past that. Let's keep walking. Okay, try it again. Try it again. Yeeees! Yees! Yeees!
 Yees!
 Good, good, good.
 Now, flourish the pinkie.
 Flourish the pinkie. Yees! Well, what have we got here? A pair of poofs about town. Sodomites in frilly lace.
 No!
 No, no!
 Nayeth.
 Oh, nayeth, nayeth. No, we are simply two noble Britishmen out on a stroll.
 Good day, sir.
 Good day. Oh! Boys get the tar. Shit. Deandra, come and help me count my gold. I'm not your slave anymore, Franklin. I'm about to go live like the goddamn Queen of England and never see you two bitches again. Charles, I told you the revolution pays. Yeah, yeah, but look at this, huh? Guys, there is a full-fledged revolution happening outside right now! It is a bloodbath! We have got to do something! What? Uh, let's back up and talk about what this is. No, no, no, this is not important. This is not important right now, okay?
 I think it's very important.
 There's a war happening outside
 and we need to
 We were acting like British noblemen, and then he couldn't drop the she-male thing, so we got tarred and feathered for being Sodomites! It is not a she-male thing Goddamn it, we don't have time for this! Help! Help me! Are you okay? Are you dying? No, no, no, don't die yet! Don't die yet until you get me to your mansion. No, I'm unscathed, my darling.
 Oh, thank God.
 This is the blood of my men. We've suffered too many casualties.
 All our guns jammed.
 Blame that on your witch wife. Let me see that. Permit me to hide out here till British reinforcements arrive and massacre the entire lot of rebels. Then shall we escape safely together, my darling? Oh, okay. I'm gonna go get you some water. Yeah, hey, Cricks, when the reinforcements get here, Dennis and I are cool, right? We're not on your shit list? Yeah, like, we got tarred and feathered for your ass, so Protect me, and I shall make sure that all of you are safe for the mighty soul Shit! Goddamn it, Frank. You just ruined my all life.
 Wait, wait, wait, check his pulse.
 He doesn't have a head. Oh, my God. If the British come in here and find this body, we are screwed. Oh, Jesus! He's right. We've got to get rid of this body. How are we gonna to do that?
 Maybe we could bury.
 No, there's no time. We've got to burn that body.
 It's gonna go to their intention.
 Let's cut it of in pieces. I've got an idea.
 Yeah? You have it?
 It's heavy. Shit! Bro, we just broke the liberty bell. I'll get you, my pretty! It's totally broken. Knock this story!
 Okay?
 We weren't finish yet. Just a I've finished listening. Have you now? Okay, that's fair. The end, I guess. So, are we in an historical landmark, now?
 No!
 You got to be kidding me!
 Such a good story.
 Maybe she didn't understand the story.
 Maybe skim too much.
 Yeah, let's tell the false story this time.
 We won't leave out any details.
 A lot more details. You know what? Sit back, get concentreted, it's gonna get a low longer this time.
 You're ready?
 The start is the same. The year was 1776                       Admit it, dude. You totally cried. I didn't cry, Charlie. I saw tears coming out of your eye Extreme Home Makeover will make the hardest man soft. Oh, it makes everybody cry.
 That is really ridiculous.
 Oh, is it? You're the biggest thief I've ever met in my life. Dennis, do you know that she is inheriting my house? Of course he knows it. He's the one who lost the house by letting you into it. And now since I'm his next of kin the house belongs to me. Frank, if you want to get your house back, check it out. Make a vision board, put your house on it-- boom.
 You get the house back.
 What the hell's a vision board? Oh, it's the secret. Yeah, the secret is a self-help book that Dee read and explained to us. It's about how you can get whatever you want without having to work for it. Yeah, man, all you have to do is envision all the shit in the world that you want, cut pictures of it out and paste it on a board,
 and then you get it. You get the stuff.
 Check it out. See how I got all these sweet pics of Ty Pennington from Extreme Home Makeover? I'm gonna become like him. I'm gonna have that dude's life. Yeah, now, that's Charlie's vision, but it's not mine. You see, my vision is to have a gorgeous yellow Lamborghini that I'm very much looking forward to driving. Yeah, and I'm gonna impregnate Danica Patrick while getting drunk in the Sahara Desert on a dune buggy. I hate to tell you this, but, you know, this self-help stuff-- it's all bullshit. It's a big scam. Oh, is it, Frank? That's funny, 'cause that's how I got the house. See, I envisioned the courts recognizing how ridiculous it was that my son of a bitch, asshole mother didn't leave me anything and then I did some good deeds and boom, I'm rich. Mansion rich. Wait a second. You didn't say anything about doing good deeds. Is that a part of this? Oh, yeah, yeah, that's part of it. You have to do that. You get back what you put in. Right! That makes sense. That's probably why Ty Pennington has such a sweet life.
 Yeah, man, and he's got great hair, too.
 Of course he's got great hair. You know, this has got me thinking, guys. It could be really beneficial for us to go out and actually
 do some good deeds.
 Wait a second. Maybe helping other people is the best way to help ourselves. Right, right. So like what is the best way you can help other people? The best way in the world to help other people.
 What would Ty Pennington do?
 What would Ty Pennington do? What the hell are you doin' with my bowling ball? It's no longer a bowling ball, Frank, it's now a wrecking ball. We're gonna use it to tear down a house and then we're gonna build up a dream. Yeah, baby. And then we get our Lamborghinis and our Danica Patricks and
 Whatever we want.
 Ooh, you guys. I want to jump in on this if that's okay, 'cause I ran the numbers and I'm gonna need a butt load of money to pay the property taxes on my new mansion.
 My mansion.
 Jesus, Frank, really still? Why do you care? You don't even want to live there. That's not the point, Deandra-- the point is it is my house and I should own it! I'll tell you what. Help us out and the universe'll probably give it back to you. I don't think so, Charlie. See, I'm operating at a much higher vibration which I think is gonna counteract his attempts at positive energy. I'll keep the house. You think that your energy's more positive than mine? Uh, yeah. I want in on this so I can screw over Deandra. You know what, man? Perfect, because we were planning on using your construction experience and your connections anyway.
 I'll be the foreman.
 Yeah, great, excellent. Well, then why don't you hop on the renovations with Charlie and I-- Mac, why don't you get started on the family makeover with Dee. Family makeover with Dee? No, I want to be a part of the renovation team. I know you do, but the thing is You get so excited about the smashing and then you make it competitive.
 You turn it into a competition.
 That's bullshit, because I'm a better smasher than you guys! I should be on the head of the smashing team!
 You want to have a smash off?
 A smash off?!
 You can't even help yourself, can you?
 Okay, fine, fine. Dee and I are gonna kick your ass, okay. Because our makeover is gonna be so much more extreme than yours. Well, now hold on a second. Charlie, our renovations are gonna be pretty extreme, right? Let's-let's all agree that we're gonna go about this in the most extreme way possible, okay. First things first, let's find a family to unleash our extremeness all over. Yeah, yeah, yeah, a desperate family that's gonna yield us the highest return. How about the Mexican family that moved in down the block? Right. What is their name? The Juarez family I think. Oh, that's perfect! We can help the Juarez family.
 Great. Great.
 They're good, they're good. Their place is a real shit-hole. Okay, great, then the Juarez family it is. It's settled. Okay, okay, and I think I know the most extreme way to go about this. Okay, Dee, you got the blindfolds, right? Well, do you guys think that the blindfolds
 are absolutely necessary?
 Yes, the blindfolds are necessary. They're there to heighten the sense of surprise and excitement creating an enjoyable experience for the family-- extreme! Okay, but here's the thing. I couldn't find any blindfolds per say, but I did bring some plastic bags. Ok, here we go, bitchies Go! Go! Go! Go! Good morning, Juarez family! Wake up, my brown friend. It's time to change your life. Yeah! Is that inspirational music, what is that? Yeah, man, inspirational. All right, that's cool. That's cool, I guess. Come here, you little rug rat. What are you doing? What's wrong, buddy? Come on, I'm trying to help you. Hey, where's your wife? Come on! Look, I'm gonna fix your house. Where's your daughter? Where's your daughter? Congratulations! We've got a surprise for you. Okay, hold still. Can't run from the kindness of strangers. We are taking over your house. Your house is ours now! Your lives are gonna change forever.
 Oh, it feels good to help people.
 Oh, man, it sure does. Okay, bag 'em. And good-bye, Juarez family. Yeah, all right! Good job! Good job!
 Hey, foreman, what's the plan?
 Mr. Foreman.
 The plan?
 Yeah. You guys get to work. I'm gonna go hop in one of their beds and get some shut-eye. I'm running on fumes. Hey, man, there's no time for that. We're on a deadline here. Now, when's your crew arriving? My crew, what crew? The construction crew. When do those guys get here? You-you're the crew. That's the way I do it. I hire two guys and let them sweat it out. All right, now, keep it down because I'm a very light sleeper. Welcome to makeover headquarters, Juarez family! This is gonna be your home for the next couple of days. Hey, in order to assimilate you with American culture, we've decided to surround you with all things American. Now who's ready for a makeover? This one is.
 Um, not that excited.
 No, not that excited at all. I okay, I think there might be a bit of a language barrier.
 Well, that could be an issue.
 Well, no, no, no, no. No, hold up, uh, somebody took a couple years of Spanish in high school.
 Okay, you rember?
 I'm gonna dust off the cobwebs and see if I can fire off a couple phrases. Tell them, um, to relax first off 'cause they look a little tense. And then, uh, we're gonna build them a new house and a new life just like on Extreme Makeover on TV. Okay, okay. Juarez, be easy. Your house is no more. Your life is no more. We are extreme. Like television. Yes? Yes?
 Yes!
 See, they get it.
 I still got it.
 They get it. We are extreme! Yeah, America! I'll tell you what, man, the more I look at this place, the nicer I think it is, you know? It's a nice place. No, it's a very charming, charming place.
 What are you doing, dude?
 What do you mean?
 Why are you smashing stuff?
 I smashed it. It's important that we get rid of anything that will remind the Juarez family of their old country. Bro, they're Americans now. Americans don't hold on to the past. Oh, the past isn't useful. You got to forget about it.
 Okay, the past isn't
 We got to gut this entire place. Here's what I'm thinking now. After we got done smashing all their old shit, I'm thinking we take out this wall. You know what I mean?
 Just let the room breathe a little bit.
 Okay, and you think that's better than just, like,
 ripping the whole house down, just
 Yeah, why
 tearing the whole thing down?
 Were you planning on destroying the entire house?
 Yeah.
 We can't demolish the entire house. That's what they do on Extreme Makeover.
 They rip the whole house down.
 Do you know how to build an entire house?
 No, I don't know how to
 I know. Well, I hadn't thought that far we would have to build a whole house.
 Yeah, we would have to build a new
 I can't build a whole house. You know what, let's just smash the one wall. And then, we'll throw a couple layers of paint up,
 and then we'll get our Lamborghinis and
 Okay, good. Let me see if the lamp takes a little dent out of it. And here comes the pitch.
 Oh, it didn't really dent the wall, though.
 No, but it did break the lamp,
 and that's part of this.
 It did break the lamp.
 I'm gonna break this.
 What's what's all the racket down here? Hey, some of us are trying to do some work here, Frank. I don't know if you noticed. Has anybody scored on their vision board yet? How on Earth can we score on our vision boards
 We just started.
 Yeah, we've been doing this for like 30 minutes. I've been sleeping for a day. That broke bastard's bed is soft as shit. You think they got any beer in the icebox?
 I could drink a swimming pool.
 Frank, you are a terrible foreman. You know what, back me up on this, Charlie.
 You're out of here, dude.
 I think so.
 You're you're done.
 You can't kick the foreman out. I'm the foreman. I tell you what to do.
 That's the way it works.
 Oh, really?
 Yeah.
 You're gonna tell me how it works?
 Yeah.
 I watch Extreme Home Makeover.
 I know how it works. What?
 Charlie! That show is just a bunch of manipulation to get people to cry, and then, they trick the viewers into buying shit. Buying shit? What are you talking about? That show is about how awesome Sears is! And how much Sears products save people's lives! And it's about caring and Sears and Okay, I'm not Now, you don't see Ty Pennington losing his cool.
 Do you want to be like him?
 Yeah. All right, well, then, just breathe for me. Feel what I'm doing. Yeah, dude, I just I'm sorry, bro, but I get very passionate about Sears I mean,Extreme Home Make I mean, what what
 Helping people.
 Helping people. Don't stop. I don't understand why this is happening. Our visas came through, yes? I don't think these people are the INS. I think we're been kidnapped. Baseball. Frank, what the hell are you doing here? Those dick wads threw me off my own work site. So, how's the old vision board coming? You getting everything you want? No, actually, we just started the whole makeover process. Yeah, we realized the reason why the Juarez family hasn't achieved the American dream yet is because they haven't envisioned it strong enough. Right, so we're having them do their own visions board, so here. Why don't you be a lamb and pass out some materials.
 What?
 Be helpful. Do something positive with your life, piece of shit. Magazines, magazines. Here-- magazines. And cut them out with this.
 What are you looking at?
 She doesn't understand what you're saying. No, no, you got to say, "Corta". That means "cut". Corta, corta! I am gonna blast your face off.
 Okay, what did you
 No one's gonna blast your face. No one's gonna do that. What did you say to her? I said what you said to say to her, and she stabbed me in the leg with the goddamn scissors.
 Deal with it.
 All right, all right, okay. Lower your cutting tool, please. Man is crazy with gun Right? And make danger for all of us.
 Yes.
 Okay, careful, watch it. Don't make man hurt you.
 Yes?
 Yes, yes.
 That makes sense, yeah?
 They got it. I'm really good at this. Dennis, yo. Last-minute thing. God, I have this brilliant idea. We need a project for him, dude. You know, we got ourselves a little Mexican girl here, and I'm thinking what does a little Mexican girl love more than anything else in the world?
 Tacos.
 Tacos, buddy. So, why not make for her a taco bed?
 You know what I mean?
 Okay. She gets to, like, be in a taco every day. So, okay, I got yellow sheets that's cheese. Green: guacamole. Red: a little pillow for salsa. And I got these cute little brown PJs so that she gets to feel like ground meat while she's sleeping.
 She's the ground meat in the middle.
 She's the ground meat in the middle. I like that, man. That's a good idea. What is this blowtorch for, man? Well, that's a propane torch. That thing's badass, man. It's like a flamethrower. But what function is it gonna serve in the home? It's for the renovation, man. It's for the controlled burns. I don't think they do controlled burns, man. Are you kidding me? Bro, they definitely do controlled burns.
 They do it off screen.
 Off screen. How do you think they tear down an entire wall so quickly? They burn it up. The community has got a lot to do with it, and then, maybe it's for burning the extra rubble. It's for tearing stuff down.
 Are you sure we need it?
 They take stuff outside and I'm not sure we I'm buying it. So, go ahead and ring that up. What are we looking at here? That will be $3,212.11. We're just gonna go ahead and put all this on the Extreme Home Makeover account. Ring it up. I have no idea what you're talking about. Really? We're performing an extreme home makeover. So, do you not have a button for that? We're helping out a family in need, okay? We're gonna do some good deeds. You know, we got a vision board thing going. This is a legitimate operation, okay? This is the real deal. I got a whole taco bed. You know what if you just give us the stuff, we'll be on our way. I'm sorry, we don't just give stuff away. I don't know why you're breaking my balls here. Sears does this, okay? Sears gives people stuff. Sears doesn't get anything out of it. Sears doesn't come in and start Look, we don't have any money, okay? What are we supposed to do here? I don't know what to tell you. If you don't have a bad credit history, you can open up a store credit card. Credit card, huh? All right, just go ahead and sign right there, and we're all set. Now, this is smart. The first step to becoming an American get a credit card. We need this guy to build up copious amounts of debt. That is the best way for him to build up his credit.
 We're doing him a favor.
 We're doing him a huge favor. And do you realize how extreme this is? To go from no debt to good old-fashioned American debt? That's the way to do it. Plus, I've been envisioning someone else paying for thing the entire time. I'm also envisioning him unloading all the shit into the car. Well, that's a great vision. Guys, no can do. We're on a very tight schedule. By the way, does anyone know why the hell Frank has been pointing a camera at us? I'll tell you why. Because I'm tired of this secret bullshit. All it got me was a stab wound in the leg. So, I'm gonna record everything you do.
 Why?
 Because I know you're gonna fail. Then, I can watch it over and over again.
 That's ridiculous.
 Whatever, Frank. You know, I'm glad you're getting all this on tape because then we'll have proof of how amazingly generous we're being today. You're going to prove that the secret is real. Gentlemen, we are all done here, so I'm gonna roll 'cause we got to
 Thank you very much.
 Let's go ahead and let's do this.
 Mostgracias.
 Good luck. All right, you got the store card now. Let's go ahead and ring that up. Bro, I'm not sure I have the right look here. No, you do, man. You just got to start thinking of the tool belt as an extension of yourself. It needs to reflect you as an individual. Do you feel that?
 Is that all that it is?
 That's all it is. All right, let me ask you a question, then. How come you have that awesome fray in your shorts? I don't have that. That, sir, is becauseyou purchased blue jean shorts whereas I purchased blue jeans and cut 'em. Thus, the fray. It's a more authentic look. I think that's what you're feeling. Why did you cut them so high? Way higher than mine. I thought you might ask that. See, it limits restriction of leg movement. You're going to get more work done 'cause you got more leg movement. Well, are you sure about that? Let me do a little demonstration on you. Take the tool belt off for a second. Let me, let me, let me just demonstrate something. Let's get it down. Take a wide stance. Take the widest stance that you possibly can and let me see what that looks like. Leg movement.
 This is, uh
 Go as wide as you can. If I'm going wide and I'm being honest with you I'm maxing out about here. That's not bad but check this out. Go, go, go. Any more? That's it, but that's pretty wide, right?
 That is good, you know
 Looks good, right? And you're not getting any high ride.
 I'm getting a high ride.
 That's a better But the shorts aren't preventing me from doing what I need to do. And that's the shorts. That's exactly right, man, and see, your shorts. They're holding you back, man. That and your hips, but I got to tell you, the shorts aren't helping. This, this is really all good shit. This is like gold. So what are you going to do next?
 You are catching all this, right?
 I got everything. This is what we're gonna do next. Grab me that propane torch.
 I'm gonna burn the wall.
 You know what? Let's go at it with the wrecking ball for a little while. It'd be more extreme and kind of awesome. Okay, all right, let's do that, then. All right, you do the wrecking ball thing Check this out. I'm gonna do a little introduction thing,
 and then you do the wrecking ball.
 Do you want to wear the belt? All right, I'm gonna be the only one wearing the belt? Just jeans and no shirt. Wait, can I see the stance one more time? That I can go lower. Bro, that is bad ass. Yours wedged in, too? Mine's completely wedged in there. We can't even get anything past the surface of this thing. There's, like, a hard surface past the thin surface. Concrete or brick or something I was envisioning this being a lot easier than it's turning out to be.
 Abso
 Use the blowtorch. Great, it's time. Hang on a second.
 Let me grab the flamethrower.
 Hold on a second, time out. Wait, I think I know what the problem is. Look, I'm the one who watches Home Makeover. I think I know what we're not doing right here. What? We haven't brought the neighborhood in yet. Absolutely great idea. Bring the neighbors in. Oh, my neighbors are great. So did the neighborhood rob us? Did the neighborhood rob us ? And they took my goddamn tool belt. I could not have anticipated Look into the camera and cry a little. You have been in our face with that camera, man. You know what, man, you know what? Just get me the flamethrower. I'm so sick of this wall, I want to burn it up now. Okay, it's time. There's also a fire extinguisher, too. Great.
 I think we should use this, man.
 I think we should, too. So here's how this is going to go down.
 I will light a fire on the wall.
 On the wall. Have that extinguisher ready, 'cause I don't want the fire to spread past the parameters of this wall. I will create a parameter with the fire extinguisher. It's the only safe way to do this, okay? It'll be perfectly safe. Then, once the wall's all weakened from the burned-up fires, then we're going to kick it to pieces, smash it to bits, and take the rubble outside and probably burn that, too. And then I'll put it out with this. Perfect, and then I'll get started on my taco bed. That sounds good. Before you do that, why don't you open that window over there and get a nice backdraft? Now he wants to start helping us. That's the first sensible thing you've said all day, Frank. It's extreme, just like we are. Go crank open a window. Let's get a backdraft going. Frank, you ready? I've never been ready for anything more in my entire life. Well, all right. Let's do this. I think we have successfully pulled off one extreme makeover. Yeah, I love their eyes. Now, while we wait, I was thinking we expose them to some good old-fashioned American cinema. Apocalypto. They can learn about how their ancestors used to be savages until Mel Gibson and the Catholics came in and saved everybody. Hey, you're just in time. Why don't you point that video camera at the new and improved Juarez family? They look freaky as shit. Wait till you get a load of their ancestors. Pop a squat, bro, 'cause we're going to watch a sweet-ass flick. I got something better to do. Bag 'em and bring 'em with us. Come on. Yes, let's go. In fact, bag yourselves, too, because I want this to be a surprise. Come on, right this way. Keep walking straight Goddamn, it's hard to breathe in these bags. Okay, hold it right here. All right, now, excuse me. Please come over here, the family. I want you on this side. My head is sweating like shit. Take the bags off. You got, you got a bus, just like in the show. It's all about the reveal. Ready? One two three ! Move that bus! Unbelievable. I cannot believe the judge made me give my mansion to the Juarez family. I can't believe their name isn't Juarez. Was anyone else surprised by that? Shocker. Well, you know, it's a, it's a broken system we got here. But at least we managed to avoid arson charges, right? That's good, yeah. Frank, I guess you're right. The secret's bullshit, huh? You try to help people and you just wind up getting screwed.                     Come one, Come all to a beautiful show It's gonna be awesome and Some other stuff Some other musical stuff.
 What you doing, buddy?
 I wrote a musical.
 You wrote a musical?
 Why, why did you do that? Just to write a musical. Does there have to be a reason? I don't think so. Yeah, there does. Nobody writes a musical for no reason. That doesn't make sense. All right, this guy did, so there you go. Who's the mark?
 What?
 Yeah. No, there's no there's no mark, guys. I wrote a musical. It's pretty damn good, okay?
 I want to put it on.
 Right. What's your angle?
 I don't have an angle.
 Whose face are we shoving this musical in? You don't shove a musical in someone's face.
 What are you talking about?
 But who versus? Who are we doing it versus? Oh, my God, are you guys going to make this about this? Look, I just wrote a musical to write a musical, okay? I don't have a ulterior motive here. I'm not trying to screw anyone or gain anything out of it. You know what, if you guys don't want to be in it, I can find other people to play your parts. Hang on there, pal. Hang on. Hang on. We're just trying to wrap our heads around this. Yeah, there's no reason to give away our parts, okay?
 All right.
 No, we'll do it. What's it called? The Nightman Cometh. The Bitches Team Okay, gather around. Please, everybody. Let's gather down front. I feel the magic Do you feel the magic? Here we go! Now, you guys, you all know Artemis. Artemis was kind enough to book for us this fine local theater.
 So round of applause for Artemis.
 Very nice. She also transcribed my work into a format you might consider a little bit more legible. Or literate. She added words to it. Yeah, right. No more interruptions now, Dee. Thank you, please. Okay, well, Charlie, I got a question for you. Who's playing this lead boy?
 That's going to be Mac.
 What?
 Oh, yeah! Lead, of course.
 Wait, who's playing the dayman? Well, the lead boy becomes the dayman when he defeats the nightman.
 So it's also Mac.
 Two parts? Oh, yeah!
 Wait, that's bullshit, bro.
 The nightman's a better role. He gets to play two roles? I mean, come on.
 It's the same person
 Charlie, who's playing the troll guy?
 You're going to play the troll guy.
 I'm the troll guy?
 Who else would be the troll?
 Oh, I like that.
 All right, good.
 Can I do it naked? Absolutely not. Why would you want to be naked? Because in the '70s, everybody did theater naked. Everybody got laid all the time. All right, well, this is not the '70s. You're going to do theater with your clothes on, please. Charlie, what the hell is this play about?
 I'm a princess who lives in a coffee shop?
 You work in a coffee shop. You don't live in a coffee shop. Read closer. Well, why am I in love with a little boy?
 You're in love with a young man.
 You wrote "boy". Well, all right, man, boy, it's a metaphor. Well, the audience is going to think I'm a child molester. I've changed my mind. I'm playing the nightman.
 Oh, yeah.
 Why would you want to play the nightman? The nightman's bad-ass, dude. He has the eyes of a cat
 and does karate across the stage.
 Where are you getting that from?!
 Karate?!
 No, I made that up, man. This is great. That frees up the lead boy role and the dayman role.
 I can play both those.
 No, I don't want you guys switching roles.
 That's not how it works.
 Hey, Frank you got a guy that does cat eyes?
 I'm already on it.
 All right, God, for the love of God. You know what? Let's just get started.
 Okay, you guys ready?
 Yeah. Tiny boy, little boy, Baby boy, I need you Tiny boy, little boy, Want to make love to you, boy Okay, hold on a second.
 Charlie?
 Yes.
 Are you goddamn kidding me?
 What? "Tiny boy, little boy, baby boy"? Yes. You're wanting me to say that I want to make love to a little, baby, tiny boy. But I have explained this to you, Dee. I'm talking about the spirit of this man-- is like a little boy.
 It's a metaphor.
 You keep using that word, but I'm not convinced you know what it means. And also, I'm not making out with Dennis later. 'Cause it says we're supposed to do that at the end of the song,
 and that's not going to happen.
 I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with that either, bro. Well, this is why I didn't think you should be playing the boy, okay? I don't want you guys kissing either. What if it's just a sexually charged embrace? Okay, Artemis, please don't talk to the talent. You know what? Um All right, screw this shit. If no one likes the song, I'm going to cut the song.
 Thank you.
 Whoa, no, no, no, no, don't cut the song, man. I like the song. Dee, apologize to Charlie. I'm not going to do that. He wants me to bang this baby,
 and I don't feel comfortable.
 I think it's a bad idea to cut the song. Thank you, Artemis. Thank you very much. All right, could you give me a second with with the talent here? Thank you. Uh, Dennis, could you take a five? Uh, well, I just want the song, man.
 I would like for you to take a five.
 Five five minutes? Can we have five now please? Can you have a five over there? Will you take a five, Dennis?! Take a five, please! Okay, Dee, the song is history. Thank you, Charlie. I appreciate that. 'Cause I was uncomfortable.
 Yeah, I'll bet.
 What are we going to sing instead?
 What should I sing?
 Uh, what's on the back there?
 It's the same song.
 And what's on the very back page?
 Nothing.
 Then that's what you'll be singing.
 Charlie, this is my big song.
 Yeah, yeah. Everybody else has a big song. I deserve to have one.
 Do you? Don't screw you?!
 Don't screw me like this, Charlie. Come on! Oh, I'm sorry, Dee. Um, let me try and rember something. Uh, let's see was it did Dee write a musical and come to Charlie with it? No, Charlie wrote a musical and came to Dee with it. And the gang. And the gang likes to screw it up and make it about themselves and take it away from Charlie and ruin his hopes and dreams. So let me tell you something, Dee; let me break down a scenario for you. I could cut the song, okay, because I wrote it. I could have Artemis do the song, okay, because you did not write it. Or I could strap on a wig and I could do the song myself. So you tell me, little Miss All That, what do you want to do-- song or no song? Song. Song?
 Yeah, song.
 You want to sing a song.
 I never wasn't going to sing the song.
 You were excited about singing a song,
 and you want to sing a song?
 Yeah, I would like to do it. Good! So back up on your podium you go. Thank you. Dennis, what are you doing? I'm eating because I'm very uncomfortable. Well, you guys are making Can you just get on the stage please, and can we finish this rehearsal?
 It was really loud and
 Don't start! That wasn't five minutes. Okay, you know what, you guys have me up to here. Okay, I'm here. I don't want to be here, okay? Now I have to play the piano and I'm all up here. So let's you know what, let's try and get this down. Let's try and work this down a bit, okay? And you know what's going to do that, learning the song, the way it's written. Let's do it. Back to the top. Five, six, seven, eight Got to play the troll toll To get into this boy's hole You've got to pay the troll toll To get in You want this baby boy's hole, You've got to pay the troll toll Stop, stop, stop. All right, not bad. Good rhythm, love the enthusiasm. I feel like you're saying "boy's hole", and it's clearly "soul". And I know, Artemis, you did write "soul", right?
 I did write "soul".
 So it's "boy's soul". You got to pay the troll toll to get in this boy's hole No, see, right there. It sounds like "hole". Like if you drag that out Are you chewing gum?
 Yeah.
 Give me the gum, okay?
 Give me the gum, Frank, please?
 He said, "No gum".
 I said, "No gum," everyone.
 It's unprofessional.
 Okay. Thank you.
 Charlie, can I bring something up?
 Yes.
 I think we have to be very careful
 about how we do the rape scene.
 Yeah. What in God's name are you talking? There's no rape scene. Well, sure, I pay the troll toll, and then I rape Dennis. No, you don't rape him. You become him.
 You do not rape him.
 He doesn't? No! Look, let me just walk you guys through this, okay? Here's what happens. Once you pay the toll, I want you to come over to Dennis over by his bed here, okay?
 I'll be lying back.
 You want me to cross the stage?
 Yes.
 All right, this is a great opportunity to showcase some skills, and, like, just put on a clinic.
 I would rather you didn't.
 Well, I think the people are gonna want to see that. And then I'll hop up sort of like a cat, like so. Jesus Christ, just leave it at that. Okay, once he gets near you, you have to sense him, okay? Suddenly, you sense him. What if I were to position him in a way where I get behind him, and then Frank could throw that blanket that he's got right there over us, and then that way you can't see the penetration. That's a good idea. You know what, Charlie? Because the blanket will make the rapings I'm sorry,
 the sexing from behind feel more classy.
 That's good. And what I can do is thrust this way, and you can struggle. Now I'm here, okay? I am, I'm past where I thought I could go. I'm, like, all the way up here with it.
 Oh, my-- Hey, you!
 Oh, my God! You scared me! I'm sorry. I dropped, like, a hundred-dollar bill under there. I can't find it anywhere, and then What are you doing walking here?
 Is this one of your walking places?
 Charlie, I have Mace. Oh, my God, check this out. I have a free ticket for you to see a musical that I wrote. Oh, wow, a free ticket to a play that I don't want to see.
 You don't want to see it?
 I don't want to.
 It's a front row seat.
 I don't care. I don't want to see your play. I'm gonna cut you a bargain, okay? I'm gonna cut you a little deal. You come and see this play-- I didn't want to have to do this--
 but if you come and see this play
 Yeah? I'm gonna leave you alone for the rest of your life.
 Really?
 Yeah. Okay, so you're not gonna follow me home anymore and you're not gonna call me at 3:00 in the morning and tell me that you are in the emergency room in the hospital because you had a terrible car accident?
 Yeah, well, it's great that you came.
 Well, you listed me as your emergency contact.
 Well, yeah, because I consider you that.
 I have to go! All right, I swear to God I'm gonna leave you alone. I'm gonna stop listing you as my emergency contact. I'm gonna stop calling you. All that stuff if you see the musical. That's how much this means to me. Nice.
 Leave me alone.
 You're not gonna regret it. I regret it already. All right. Charlie, what is going on, dude?
 When are we gonna start?
 We're gonna start we're ready to start. Stop hounding me. We were supposed to start 20 minutes ago. We're not gonna start She's here! She's here! She's here! She's here! Circle in, everybody. Can we get down in the middle? Can we get down front? A couple last-minute things. I just want to brief everyone on this. Artemus, can you bring in Gladys? This is Gladys. She's going to be playing the piano instead of me tonight.
 What? Why?
 It's cool. She knows all the songs. Gladys, can you head out there and get us started? I forgot to tell you, Calvin Coolidge was a good friend of mine. You've been telling me that Calvin Coolidge was a friend of yours, like, all morning.
 And at a certain point
 How many times? Like, a hundred times now. At a certain point, I need you to stop telling the Calvin Coolidge story and start playing the piano. Don't shush me, okay? Now please don't shush me. We have to start. Just get her out there and get the play started! What the hell you doing? You can't be throwing us curveballs like this. Don't argue with me right now, okay? We just gotta do this. Let's stick together. Real quickly, okay? Just a couple of things. I can't really move my arms in this thing, so I think I need to rip the pits. Do not rip that costume, okay? It's very expensive. All right, fine, but one other thing. I wrote a song. I'm gonna throw it in. I swear to God, you cannot add a song. It's gonna happen. I will smack your face off of your face. Do not add a song. It started. It started. You gotta get out there. Just get out there. What is this strange feeling? I feel so strange inside. It's so strange, but appealing. I feel good, oh! Tiny boy, little boy, baby boy, I need you. Tiny boy, little boy, I want to touch you. If you only knew
 What I'd do to you.
 Boy, I need you, boy. If I was that boy, that's inside of you. Tiny boy, little boy, Baby boy, I need you Tiny boy, little boy, I want to make love to you. If you only knew, what I'd do to you. If I was that boy, that's inside of you. Inside, inside, inside of you.. My boy Oh, boy. Just to be clear, I did not write that song, And have never had sex with a child Just to be clear. What? What is happening? Most men find me to be an eight or nine out of ten. And I am available to any interested men. Who'd like to get my number after the show. Keep singing, bitch! You're not gonna have a face by the time I'm done with you! What the hell is she doing? She's bombing like crazy. What an idiot. I was awesome, though, right? You? No, dude, you totally froze up out there. You sucked. I was hearing a lot of laughs out there, bro. Laughs are cheap. I'm going for gasps. Wait till you see, dude. Gasps are where it's at. Gotta go pop my cat eyes in. That's good. That is not good. This is not a comedy, okay? No one's supposed to be laughing. You came at the right time. Is he sleeping? Yes, he's sleeping right over there, just the way you like 'em. Did you bring the toll? Confound your lousy toll, troll. God damn it. Stop laughing at me. You gotta pay the troll toll, if you want to get into that boy's hole. You gotta pay the troll toll to get in You want the baby boy's hole, You gotta pay the troll toll, You gotta pay the troll toll to get in. Troll toll What you say? Troll toll! Troll toll! Here's your toll, troll. Your boy awaits. At last, the boy's soul is mine. Give me that leg, boy. Dude, do you have a boner right now? Shut up, dude, don't ruin this for me. What? Oh, Jesus. That's enough. I could smack everyone into tiny, little pieces. Hello, boy. Come over here and scratch my itchy-witchy toesy-woesies. What? Get over here.
 No, Antonio.
 I control you. You control nothing. I am not your slave anymore, and I'm not a boy. I am a man, see? I was transformed by the strong musky power of true love. I am now The Dayman. What the hell is that? You know what it is, bitch. Where's the boy? The boy is gone. You can't tell me what to do. I didn't tell you what to do. You're skipping a line, dude.
 You can't tell me what to do
 You're still skipping the same line. Just move past it. God, it's crazy how much better I am at acting than you are. I'm going to kick your ass, bro. I'll tell you what I am the ruler of darkness. I am the master of light. I am the Dayman. Whatever, bro.
 Here's whatever, bitch.
 What? No, don't improv. Don't tell me what to do. Body bag. You have defeated the evil that was here. Naturally. For I am the Dayman. You once were a boy and now you're man. And I am in love with you. That's right. And now I am in love with you. Dayman, Fighter of the Nightman Champion of the sun, You're a master of karate and friendship for everyone. Dayman Fighter of the Nightman Champion of the sun You're a master of karate and friendship for everyone Dayman Fighter of the nightman Champion of the sun You're a master of karate and friendship for everyone Dayman! Stage freeze. Don't say "stage freeze." Just do it. I was that little boy. That little baby boy was me. I once was a boy But now I am a man I fought the Nightman, lived as Dayman. Now I'm here to ask for your hand, So if you want to marry, man, Will you marry me? Will you come on stage and join me. In this thing called matrimony? Please say yes and do not bone me, please. Just marry me. Is that it? Is the play over? Okay, great. Well, then I'm out of here. Hang on, hang on, hang on a second, hang on.
 Is it a yes, or?
 Is it a yes? Really, Charlie, will I marry you? No, no, I will not. I will never marry you. And I also held up my end of the bargain, so I never have to see you again. Okay, so wait. I'm sorry, I want to get this clear. You are saying no? Oh, I am definitely, definitely saying no. Well, I didn't ever sign anything, so I'll see you tomorrow? That's it. You can go home. It's over.
 We've got to bow.
 Hold on. If you want. This was a great musical. You did a great job. Told you nobody just writes a musical for no reason. I am here. I am passed here. And by the way, I thought the rape scene went really well. I am here. I am here with it. And that was awful for me. And if you bring this up back at the apartment tonight, I'm going to smack you, I swear to God.                      [Mac] So, how many restraining orders does the waitress have on you? [Charlie] A lot, dude. She's been irritated with me. "You got me fired from the Oldies Rock CafÃ©. Guys. You're gonna get me fired from the coffee shop. " This is incredible. Listen to this message. Come here. This chick is so in love with me, it's crazy. [On Phone] Hi, Dennis, it's Caylee. I was just calling to let you know that I hope you die! You are obviously a terrible person with no regard for anyone but yourself! I never, ever want to see you again, you steaming pile of horseshit! Go to hell! [Laughs] Whoa, that's amazing. That's the best one yet. Yeah, it's a really good one. What? She hates your guts. Dee, this chick is so in love with me, she doesn't even know it. They don't get it because you haven't explained it to them, bro. Oh, guys, I have a system, a foolproof system for getting any chick's undying love and devotion for life. What the hell are you talking about, dude? I'm talking about the D.E.N.N.I.S. System. Ladies and gentlemen, the D.E.N.N.I.S. System is a comprehensive approach to seduction that I have perfected over the years. See, my success with women does not solely stem from my good looks and my charm. There is a careful, systemic approach that has allowed me to become the playboy that I am today.
 A playboy? Is that how you see yourself?
 Yes. He has banged a lot of chicks. Just shut up, Dee. Shut up. Now, the first step to any erotic conquest is to "D"- demonstrate your value. In this most recent case my subject was Caylee, a cute pharmacist. [Dennis] I demonstrated my value to her by filling a prescription. I told her, "It's for my grandmother. She's quite ill." Thus demonstrating my value as a loving grandson and an all-around great guy.
 You're forging prescriptions now?
 That's the easy part, Dee. I would've gone in and bought a box of magnum condoms, thus demonstrating that I have a monster dong. Right. That comes of a little bit desperate, Frank. Now, if you want to have a magnum condom peeking out of your wallet when you go to pay, that's a different story.
 [Frank] Oh, yeah.
 Now let's move on. Once you've demonstrated your value, you are going to want to ask her out. Once you've asked her out, you move on to "E." "Engage physically." I personally try to engage the girl physically without ever going on the date, which to me is really just a waste of time and money. [Dennis] I'll tell her I know this great little restaurant that doesn't take reservations. That makes it sound cool, makes it sound exclusive. And then when we get to the restaurant, the restaurant is closed, as, of course, it always is on Sundays. So I'll feign surprise and say something along the lines of, "I guess we could grab a pizza and watch a movie at my place." That's where I come in. Oh, you're a part of this? Oh, yeah. Mac has a very special place in my system. Yeah. You see, I'm on the couch when they come in and ask to be alone.
 Then I say-
 I can't go in my room. I found a black widow spider in there. Dennis fires back that he wants some privacy so that they can get to know each other better.
 [Dennis] And then I say-
 Oh. Well, I guess we could eat the pizza on my bed and watch the DVD in my room. And once we're on my bed, it is game over. I engage her physically and the sexual waltz begins. Pizza's good. You're the one that's good. Smooth! Very- Very smooth stuff. Very classy. I'm learning a lot from you right now, dude. Okay. Now, once you've had sex with a woman, she will naturally start to depend on you. Okay? All women do this. They certainly do. You got that right. [Laughing] Sex with women! Once you bang 'em, you know- Like that. Right. Right. Which brings me to the first "N." "Nurturing Dependence." You're gonna want to nurture that dependence that she's feeling on you now, guys. Have her car towed. Or you can slash her tires. Either way, make her depend on you for rides. Or you can use my personal go-to, which is to create a fictional, angry neighbor who is threatening her and tell her you'll take care of him. [Dennis] Hit up a pay phone so that she can't trace the calls back to you. Give her a call and say something along the lines of [Sinister Voice] I'm watching you, you bitch. You're gonna die tonight! [Sobbing] Oh, for Christ's sake! You're a complete sociopath! Don't interrupt. Okay? Now, if you've completed all the other steps properly up to this point, she'll naturally want to take the relationship to the next level. But you're not gonna do that. You're gonna do the exact opposite. Pull back, guys. Pull back. Which brings me to the second "N," "Neglect Emotionally." You stop taking her phone calls. Cancel all your plans. Maybe that fictional, angry neighbor that you've simulated comes back, and this time you're not around to cool him off. [Rings] Hello? [Sinister Voice] Welcome to hell! [Sinister Laughing] [Sinister Laughing] This will frighten the shit out of her. Okay? And she'll start getting really mixed up because you're not there to protect her. She'll start questioning her self-worth, start questioning her- her self-esteem. And that's the perfect time to "I" "Inspire Hope." In Caylee's case, I went to her window and I screamed Caylee, listen. Listen. Wait. I want to tell you that the reason I was distant is because I was afraid that you were gonna break my heart and I got scared. But I'm not scared anymore, baby. I love you. I need you. And then, naturally, we bang.  [Slow Pop]  Watchin' every motion in my foolish lover's gaze . And this is the best bang of all because it's very emotional for her. You see, she thinks she's broken through my tough exterior and coerced affection from a man who is afraid to love. And then I slink out into the night, never to talk to her again. "Separate Entirely." Yes, Mac. That's right. I "S" "Separate Entirely." D-E-N-N-I-S. The D.E.N.N.I.S. System. That, my friends, is the key to winning any girl's heart. Yeah! All right! Good stuff. Better than I remember it. Oh, good! Are you kidding me? You are not winning their hearts. You're torturing them and they end up hating you. Actually, Dee, they end up loving me more than they ever thought was possible. And you set it up so you can get these chicks back at any time? That's exactly right, Charlie. You're really picking up on this. I'm proud of you, bud. There is no way that girl is gonna come back to you after what you just put her through. I could absolutely get that girl back anytime I want. I just choose not to. I 100% guarantee you this girl's finished with you. Well, I take that as a challenge, Dee, and I accept that challenge.
 I'll have her back by the end of the day.
 Yeah. Dee, you don't get it. This is what men do! This is what men do! Yeah! This is man stuff, Dee! Man stuff! Whee! Man stuff! [Laughing, Hooting] [Growling]
 This is what men-
 Yee-hoo! Aah-aah-aah! You're probably getting D.E.N.N.I.S. 'd right now by that new boyfriend of yours, and you don't even know it. What boyfriend? She don't have a boyfriend! Yes, I do! Ben. You know, the online soldier that I met. We're back together now. What? That dude wouldn't date you after what you put him through! Maybe he'd D.E.N.N.I.S. you, but he wouldn't date you. He's not D.E.N.N.I.S.-ing me! He's in the car right now. I told him to wait for me. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What? So, wait. Your guy has been waiting out here the whole time in the hot sun? Yeah. I told him to wait for me. He kinda does whatever I say. It's pretty great. Why'd you tell him to do it with the windows up? That's cruel. The engine's not even on. I didn't. I just didn't tell him to do it with the windows down. He's not the smartest, but Dee, it's, like, I'm assuming that he has engaged you physically? Well, I mean, of course we've engaged physically. Look at that body. It is stupid. Of course we've engaged over and over physically. But that doesn't mean that he's pulling some sort of a system. Hey, guys! Hey- Hey, Dee! I didn't see you there. Are you almost done? Yeah. Yeah. I got caught up in a story. But I'll be done pretty soon. O-O-Okay. Well, do you want me to come in? No. No, I don't. No. You just- You just stay where you are. You know what? I'll text you when I'm wrapping up. Then you can crank the A.C. , cool the car off for me. Okay. Sure thing. See you, fellas. Okay. Good. See you, man. Dee, you're getting played. You're getting played big time. He's not doing anything. Big time! He's just- I told him to sit [Sighs] And there you go. Good to see you. See you soon. Bye.
 Hey, Caylee.
 What do you want? Listen, before you say anything, I just want to say that I'm really sorry for everything that went down between us. It's all my fault. Nana took a turn for the worse, [Voice Cracking] and it's got me in a really bad place. I just I don't know what I would do if she died. I don't think your grandmother exists, Dennis. I beg your pardon? Uh, yeah. I looked into it. There's no, um, Dr. Toboggan in Philadelphia either. Oh. No- Yeah, he doesn't- He's not based in Philly. Oh, no? Yeah. No, it says Philadelphia right there. Oh. Yeah- No, that I'm gonna call him because if he's still giving people prescriptions on that pad, those people could get in a lot of trouble. Oh! Whoa! What the hell are you doing here? I'm swooping in on your chick. What? No. Dude, I'm trying to re-D.E.N.N.I.S. This chick so I can shove it in Dee's face. What is this "swooping in" business? Oh, that's my system. The M.A.C. "Move-in After Completion." I wait till you're done with them. Then I swoop in, give them shoulder to cry on, and then we hump. You been humping these girls after I'm done with them? Oh, yeah, dude. I come in as the sensitive, intellectual type. Why do you think I'm always reading books and shit when we do the spider routine? I thought you were just my wing man though. No. No. I'm swimming in your wake.
 What are you two dickheads doing here?
 What are you doing here?
 I'm here for the scraps.
 I haven't had a chance to get in there yet, okay? So just What's taking you so long? Wait, wait, wait! You have a system where you come in after Mac? That's right. I come in after Mac. But he's taking forever this time. I got my magnum condoms. I got my wad of hundreds. I'm ready to plow. You should see him feast. He's like a mantis. It's amazing. Oh, that's good. Call me that from now on. Mantis. No! Nobody's calling you Man- Look, you guys gotta back off, okay? I'm trying to re-D.E.N.N.I.S. This chick. No, you back off! Wait a second, Frank. He's right. It's a delicate ecosystem. We gotta stick with it. Just let him do his thing. Then we'll come in for seconds and scraps. Back off. Get out. Just play it cool. Before she sees you. Hurry up, though, because Magnum condoms and a wad of hundreds. Idiot. This is so exciting. You're gonna love this. Okay, just stop right there. Okay. And off with the- Okay, here we are! I set up a picnic for us! [Laughs] What the hell are you doing? What- I- I set up a picnic. Do you not like picnics? Okay. All right. I know what's going on. I- I'm on to you, guy. You bring me out here to some landfill in the middle of nowhere, you blindfold me so I have no idea where I am I'm gonna depend on you to get home! Dee, do you want to go? Yeah. Oh, yeah. I wanna go, but not with you! I'll go all by myself. I'll take the bus. Okay. And I'll also take this. Thank you. Here. Do you want a glass? No! Stop it! Do you need bus fare? I don't need bus fare! I'm not sure the bus comes out here anyway.
 I'll walk then, okay?
 Wh- In your heels? They're very nice.
 Here, take my boots.
 Stop it! Stop trying to make me depend on you, okay? I'm fine all by myself, buddy! I'm doing just fine by myself. [Screaming] [Groaning] Oh, my God! Are you okay? [Gasping] I'm fine! Well, just stay there. I'm gonna come down to help. Leave me alone! I won't give you the satisfaction! I'm fine!
 I'm independent, and I don't need you!
 Wait! I don't need anybody! [Grunting Continues] Where are you going? Shut up! [Rattling] Oh, what the hell!
 Oh, what the hell, Charlie!
 Oh, hey! Look who's home! Uh- Hang on a second. What you doing there? I'm calling the police. Oh, no! You don't have to call the police. Check it out. I'm here just to fix your garbage disposal. Is that a bag of hair in your hand, Charlie? Have you been breaking into my apartment and shoving hair in my sink? Okay. Okay! Let's start over. We're getting way of topic here. I would like you to focus on the amount of value that I am demonstrating to you by fixing your garbage disposal. Just get the hell out of my apartment. Are you sure? 'Cause your garbage disposal's a mess. Pretty sure. It's way worse than when I got here. I think you should get out. All right. I like this blouse you're wearing. That's nice. Is that new? What is that? It's modern, right? This is my uniform that I have to wear for my other job, and it's ugly. Well, no, it's not ugly. It's just, you know- It's unique. So what's this new job? I work at the fair. You're working at the fair! Well, look at us, you know? I'm a plumber. You're a fair worker. They go well together, right? Get out of my apartment. Oh, all right. I don't know. I did everything right, and I can't get past the letter "D," dude.
 Well, what did you do exactly?
 I broke into her place. I ripped her sink apart. I brought a bag of hair. You know what I mean? And I come across looking like a total jerk. Yeah, of course. Because nothing that you just described sounds correct. These are totally the type of things you were talking about- slashing a girl's tires, doing scary voices.
 Do you know anything about plumbing?
 Uh no. Maybe it's just over my head, this system. Maybe I should just stick to stalking. Maybe that's my system. She got a job at the fair. It could be fun to stalk around a fair. Jesus Christ on the cross, you look like shit. Yeah! That's 'cause I spent the night in the woods trying to demonstrate my independence! Okay, clearly none of you have any idea how to run my system! Goddamn- All right. I'm gonna get everybody what they want, including myself. Let me just think for a second. Let me just work something out here and then we'll  [Orchestra: Carmen] [Dee] What's he doing? Just shut up and let him work.  [Stops] We're going to the fair. Mmm! [Charlie Laughs] That will provide the perfect setting for all of our needs to be met. You will demonstrate your value to the waitress by winning a prize at her booth. Good, dude! Then I give her the prize and that's good! No, that's dead wrong actually. You're gonna take the prize and award it to the bustiest woman you can find. Okay? Your indifference to the waitress will only make you more attractive to her. Now, Dee, because of your ridiculous missteps, you actually have no value. Mm-hmm. So your only hope is to lower Ben's value. You're gonna do this by flirting with a carney in front of him. Oh, gosh, yeah, I don't know if I want to deal with a carney. No one likes dealing with carneys, and that's why Frank will pose as one. Now, Mac, you're the final piece in this puzzle. I need you to resume your role as the thoughtful roommate and invite Caylee out to the fair. There I shall be waiting to win back her heart.
 How you gonna do that?
 I gotta get myself a grandmother. What's happening? What's happening is, we're at the fair, Gladys, and you're gonna act like my grandma, okay? My grandmother had an affair with Susan B. Anthony. I-I don't give a shit. I'm paying you not to talk. Well, hello! This is a coincidence, huh? No, it's not. No, it's not. But it's exciting, isn't it? So, what game do we have here? What game is this? Speed Pitch. That's all you do? You throw a pitch? I mean, what prizes are there? There are no prizes, Charlie. It's just to see "how fast can you throw." Oh! Then I guess I'll demonstrate my value to you by firing off a wicked hot fastball, huh? [Chuckles] You know this game is for children, right? I don't care that it's for kids. All right? Let me demonstrate my value to you. Please! When I was little, all the kids would beat me up and call me Bookworm.
 Right this way, Nana.
 Kids are so brutal. Oh. Hi, Mac, Caylee. I didn't see you there.
 What are you doing here?
 This is my nana. She's on the mend, so I wanted to get her out of the house.
 This is your grandmother?
 Oh, yeah. Yeah. This is Nana. Yeah. Isn't she precious? My grandmother was a lesbian. Well? How does it look? It's great. You look like a lizard. I like turtles. Okay. Ooh, look! A carney!  [Humming] Ooh! Eh. Frank! Hey, Frank! What are you doing? Lose the tie. You're way overdressed. I got a new angle. What? [Caylee] No, Dennis, this does not change Leave us alone. What? What? Just listen to me for one second, okay? Dennis, I've been looking all over for you. Where you been? Hello. Dr. Toboggan. Nice to meet you. Hi. Frank, what are you doing? Actually, it's Mantis. Mantis Toboggan, M.D. I got your test results. You're positive. You got the H.I.V. Yes, AIDS. Big time! What the hell you talking about? Dennis, what- You got the AIDS big time! What are you doing, dude? Did you see her face? Look at her. I'm breaking her down. I'm making her feel worthless. You see? She thinks she's got the H. I.V. Then I slip in.
 ## [Whistles] Get it?
 There is an order here, dude! Get back in line! No! No more thirds for Frankie! Seconds from now on! [Grunts Loudly] All right! That was rough! [Bell Clangs] Fifteen. [Computer Voice] Fifteen. It's 'cause I'm getting tired. My arm's blown out. Hey, Speed Pitch. You want to play? [Growls] Okay. Oh! Hey, wait, wait. Hey, guy. Do you work here? Yeah. Yeah! Oh, shit. Ben, look. A carney. Hey. So, I wonder if there's a kissing booth anywhere close. [Bell Clanging] [Computer Voice] Sixty-four! Ow! Ow! Ow, you stabbed me! He stabbed me with a key! Will someone- someone call a doctor! Ow! You idiot! Why would you stab me? I was flirting with you! That guy paid me to. You weren't supposed to stab her, man! You were supposed to stab her! What? You want to have me stabbed? I was gonna protect you from the stabbing. Wrong! Wrong! Wrong! Wrong! You're supposed to let her get stabbed, hope that it hits a main artery, and then as she's dying you nurse her back to health, thereby making her totally dependent on you! Ohh! See, this is why nobody should be going off my system! What do you mean, "Off your system?" My system of seduction that I used to win your heart, that these idiots are ruining right now! Ben's the only one who's using it properly.
 Ben, explain the system.
 I don't know what you're talking about. You had your face painted like a goddamn frog person and you have no ulterior motive here?
 I'm a lizard.
 Oh, whoops! Oh! I dropped my monster condom that I use for my magnum dong. I'm out of here. I'll give you a ride! Thank you. What? What are you doing? I'm leaving. Dee, I don't like you. Well, how is that possible? You're a mean person. [Stammers] You know what? You go! You get outta here! Way to go, jerks! Good job! Yeah? Way to go to you. You work at a fair, carney! Don't call her a carney, man. I don't need you to take up for me! Get out of here! Shut up! Just go! Get outta here! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Idiots ruining my system. Everybody ruins my system! Nobody gets it! Oh, system, my ass. I hate carnivals. I need a ride. Is there anybody out there that could take me home? [Voices Speaking Backwards]                        [Charlie] Now keep in mind, we've been locked in this parking garage stairwell for, like, 20 minutes, dude. Okay, so then we turn around, and what do we see? A scary homeless dude. And I'm, like, "Oh, shit! " Yeah! And I'm like, uh You know- I'm like, "What do we- What do we do?" You know? And then Mac, he's just like, "Just chill. " And I'm like, "How do we chill, dude?" Yeah. And I'm all, "Oh, shit! He's gonna talk now!" Yeah. And I'm all like, "How do you know he's gonna talk, bro?" And I'm like, "Because his mouth is opening. " And then he did talk. Yeah. And then he goes- he goes, "I'll let you out of the stairwell 'cause I have the key, because I'm the security guard instead." That's a cool story, huh? Yeah, right? Okay, so, uh Just so I'm clear on the story that you just told. Yeah. It was about you guys getting locked in a garage stairwell for 20 or so minutes. Yeah. And then a security guard came along and the security guard let you out. Well, yeah. But I mean, it's how you tell the story that makes it good. How you told the story was by far the worst part of the story. You weren't even paying attention to us, dude. All you were doing was playing on that stupid phone. Why are you rubbing on the phone? Let me rub on it. What are you doing? No, no, no! Hey, hey, Frank! Get your greasy, fat, sausage fingers of my touch screen phone. This thing's new. My fingers are not greasy. Uh, you have four sausage links in your pocket right now. Yeah, but I don't touch the sausage links. Why should I do that when I can let my shirt do the work? Watch. Hmm. No touching, and warm. [Scoffs] My God. You're an animal. Guess what, boners. I just got a part in an M. Night Shyamalan movie.
 What?
 Yeah. I'm a featured actress, which means I'm gonna be featured in a scene. What's an M. Night? Wow. Gross. M. Night Shyamalan, the Indian filmmaker from Philly. Oh, my God. This dude's a big deal, Frank. He's like a true-to-life Slumdog Millionaire. You know what I mean? He always puts some awesome twists at the end of his movies to trick the audience. Oh, yeah, yeah, like in The Sixth Sense. You find out that the dude in that hairpiece the whole time
 That's Bruce Willis- the whole movie.
 That's not the twist. That's not the twist to that movie. That wasn't? No. I'll tell you about it later. There were a lot of twists in that movie. Watch it again. You know what? You're gonna need a very crafty agent to squeeze everything out of this slumdog. I volunteer. And I decline. You are abusive and you smell like warm meat and I want you to leave me alone 'cause this is really important for me. This is important for all of us, okay? This is an opportunity for Charlie and I to get M. Night our script. Right. Since when do you and Charlie have a script? Since you walked in here and said you were in that movie. We're great storytellers. No, goddamn it! No, come on. Don't involve yourselves in this. Dee, you involved us in this the second you walked in and told us about the movie. You really shouldn't have done that. Let's get to work! Oh, oh, hoo! Let's get some beer. Dude. Yeah! Goddamn it. Whoa, whoa. Excuse me. Can I help you? Oh, great. Nonfat, sugar free, vanilla soy latte. Three shots, no foam. Also, why don't you let me in here so I can start my vocal warm-ups? I'm sorry. Who are you again? Dee Reynolds, featured actress. Reynolds? Yeah. And could you send M. Night over also, because I have a couple questions regarding the detes of my character. Right. Says you're a featured extra. [Clicks Tongue] Okay. Well, featured extra, featured actress. What's the difference? Well, the difference is a featured actress usually auditions for the role, has lines, gets a trailer, whereas a featured extra is a person whose head shot we pull off a pile, has no lines and sits in that tent over there till we're ready for her. Okay? Mmm. Okay. Ah, ah, ah, ah Where are we on the coffee situation, because it's early and I am hungover. Go sit in the tent. Now. This tent? That one. Thank you. Are you sure? [Charlie] This is hard. Mmm. I mean, because I want the movie to be big, you know, and, like, a box office smash and we want to put, like, a lot of meat in the seats, you know? Yeah. You know what I'm thinking, dude? You know what I'm thinking? Something that's happening in Hollywood that's, like, pretty cool. They take an underrated actor, right, whose career is in a slump, and then they make him a star again. Oh, that is awesome, right? Yeah, let's do that. Yeah. Yeah. So, who is the most underrated actor of all time?
 It's Dolph Lundgren.
 Correct. Why? Well, because of his spiky hair, his ice-cold demeanor and his big muscles. Absolutely. Okay. All right. All right, so we have our actor.
 Okay.
 That's great. Now we need a really great role for him. Oh, you know what I was thinking? Scientists are cool. What if he's a scientist? Okay, okay. A muscular scientist. I'm into that. Right. As long as we don't cover up that body with a lab coat, bro. No, dude. He's wearing, like, a hot mesh tank top. I like that. Now does he, like, fight crime or something? Yeah, yeah, yeah. He fights crime, uh, with his brain and his brawn. Should we be writing this down? Let's get all this down. [Laughing] All right. This is good. All right. Okay. Brains- Brawn Brawn- Muscles Oh! Dude! Yeah? I just got a Shyamalan twist to put in this bad boy. Okay. Lay it on me. What if this scientist runs around on all fours? Why would he run on all fours? It's a science experiment with a dog that goes absolutely haywire. Suddenly he wakes up with the ability to run around like a hound. You know? We're not making the lead of our big-budget action movie half dog! No, not half dog. He's all dog. Then why are we casting Dolph Lundgren? That will be the twist. Dolph Lundgren will be the voice of this dog. That's not a twist! That's a completely different movie about a talking-dog scientist with the voice of Dolph Lundgren! All right. You know what? Check this out. What if it's a man with a few dog-like qualities, like, uh, heightened sense of smell Jesus Christ, Charlie. We're not- There's no- or licking Whoa, whoa. Wait a second. A heightened sense of smell? What if he can smell crime? What if he smells crime? Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude! Yeah? What if he can smell a crime before it even happens? Holy shit, dude. That's amazing. Smells crime before it even happens! Yes, dude! We're getting somewhere. What if his entire head is just one big nose? Write that down! I like that! He's one big nose on Dolph Lundgren's body. Oh, shit! Ho! What? No. No, no, no, no, no. What are you two doing here? Well, since you've declined my offer to be your agent, I've since taken on Dennis as a client. Dennis has that "I don't give a shit" attitude, which is perfect for Hollywood, right, Dennis? I-I- I really don't care. See? See? Why do you want to be everybody's agent? Because that's where the money is. What do you do? You just put things together. You sit back, you collect 10% and you let the client do all the work. Dennis doesn't give a shit. Right? Stop talking to me. Perfect. Okay. Well, you can't just walk in here and get a part in the movie. It's not how it works. Excuse me, sir? Yes? Uh, could my client have a part in your movie? Sure. Here. Fill out this form. You do it. I'll do it. Unbelievable! Hold on a second. Hey, hey. Assistant, hey. Hi. When is somebody gonna tell me what my part is? What is your name again? Dee Reynolds. I'm your featured extra. Right. You're a corpse. A corpse? Mm-hmm. Like a zombie roaming through the streets looking for brains kind of corpse? No. Like a dead corpse. Just a dead corpse? Lifeless body lying in the street. Okay. All right. We'll call you when we're ready for makeup. I know, but Hold on a second. I have one more- Don't be- Don't walk away from me. He just- He'll be back. Dee. Jesus, you come off so desperate. Oh! Hollywood! Hollywood! Hollywood! No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No! Hey, guys. Get out of here! What is that? What are you guys doing here? We in a Hollywood situation! Yeah.
 Dennis just got a part in the movie.
 Sweet, dude. Bump it.
 Uh-
 Not gonna? All right. So, uh- So where's the slumdog? We're ready for him.
 You finished the script already?
 No, not exactly. Yeah, we, uh- We didn't want to get locked into anything, so we came up with a pitch instead. It's more like a series of ideas in no particular order, you know? Yeah. We'll work out the kinks later. So you hit a brick wall, huh? Yeah. Uh Mmm. Dennis can help you with that. He is good at coming up with awesome words. I wouldn't rule it out. You have to sign him on as a producer. That okay? Dennis? You want to be a producer? Yeah.
 Sorry.
 All right. We'll work out the detes later, man. But maybe we gotta find, like, a cooler place? Could we get a place with some A.C. going? [Charlie] Let's have a meeting and some A. C., man. Leave it to me. All right. You guys got 30 seconds. Blow my mind. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Oh, oh, oh. Guys, guys. It's the prequel to The Sixth Sense. The Fifth Sense. The sense of smell.  [Dramatic] Imagine a super ripped, super smart scientist in a mesh tank top named Dr. Dolph Lundgren. No. That's- That's not his name. He's played by Dolph Lundgren, but that's not the character's name. It could be the character's name. No, that's A doctor played by Dolph Lundgren named Dolph Lundgren? Yeah! That's confusing, dude. More confusing than making up an entirely new name for a person? That's gonna confuse people. I'm taking over. I'm taking over.
 You are losing me.
 Okay. Okay. All right, all right, all right. [Dramatic Voice] Imagine a super smart, ripped scientist played by Dolph Lundgren, who, after a terrible accident in his lab, blows off his nose! After reconstructive surgery, he soon realizes that he smells something that stinks [Recording Stops] This doctor smells crime? Possibly also runs around like a hound. No! He doesn't run I'm just saying, don't rule it out. It's possible- I didn't agree to that. It's not in any of our notes. He might run around like a hound. What do you think? Okay, uh- All right. First things first. You guys gotta type some of this shit out and get organized, for Christ's sakes. Get your shit together. Come on. I mean, that's ridiculous. Now in terms of the story, uh, clearly it's brilliant. It's amazing. Great idea. Brilliant idea. Thank you. But there is one critical element that's missing. It needs a sexual punch-up. We need to get a female lead character in there that Dolph can bang throughout the whole movie. Yeah. I kind of hate women though. Oh. I feel like they just slow action movies down too. Right, dude. No, Mac. See, you're dead wrong on that. You're dead wrong. See, one of the problems with Shyamalan's movies is that they lack a certain eroticism. What if we were to bring, uh, an incredibly hot but skeptical female lab partner into the mix? And then that way, whenever Dolph's not out busting heads because he's smelled crime, he's back at the lab performing outrageous sexual experiments on her supple, young body. Now here's the twist. And there is a twist. We show it. We show all of it. Because what's the one major thing missing from all action movies these days, guys? Full penetration. Guys, we're gonna show full penetration, and we're gonna show a lot of it. [All Chuckling] I mean, we're talking, you know, graphic scenes of Dolph Lundgren really going to town on this hot, young lab tech from behind, 69, anal, vaginal, cowgirl, reverse cowgirl All the hits. All the big ones. All the good ones. And then he smells crime again. He's out busting heads. Then he's back to the lab for some more full penetration. He smells crime. Back to the lab, full penetration. Crime, penetration, crime, full penetration, crime, penetration. And this goes on and on and back and forth for 90 or so minutes until the movie just sort of ends. That is brilliant! That is the most brilliant movie I've ever heard in my life. I think audiences are gonna be very uncomfortable seeing Dolph Lundgren's naked penis going into this young girl that you're talking about. Yeah. Just to be clear, though, I don't care either way. Well, it was worth it, you know- 30 seconds. Because we got the chick thing out of it, so this is good. Yeah, 30 seconds. Okay. All right. Well, maybe we should type this stuff up, and then, Frank, we'll be in touch. Get it all together. We'll type it up. We'll get another thing going. And think about the representation thing. Definitely, dude. Definitely. Okay. You don't have to rep him. You could just rep me. All right. Let me just get all this stuff. We're not a writing team. Okay. Are we good? Yeah. We're good. Okay. Okay, we good? Go ahead, Charlie. Okay. And we'll get- we'll get the Frank, I write better without him. Seriously. We'll talk about it. You know? Okay. [Muttering] Okay, cool. [Mac] The Fifth Sense. Here we go. Here we go. Write-Write- Write a couple words. The Fifth- Dude, go faster. Hold on. Hold on. I can't- Go faster. Ah! I got it in my head. I just- I can't type it fast enough. You can't type it at all. If I could type more better, then I think it would come out faster. Maybe we should get somebody else who can type. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Look at her, dude. Might be good to have an older lady in the mix, right, sort of a workhorse secretary? Yeah- I don't care for her demographic. I find them judgmental. Mmm. You know what I mean? Mm-hmm. We need someone more our Hello. Check out this one over here. Does he look Indian to you? Oh, yes, dude. It would be great to have an Indian in our corner, right? Oh, my God. They're natural storytellers. They're great with twists.
 Uh- Psst! Psst!
 Dude!
 Uh, where are you from?
 Baltimore. [Clicks Tongue] Right, right. Baltimore, sure.
 Where are your parents from?
 Jersey. Oh. All right. Getting nowhere here. Uh, you're so- Yeah, well, uh Is anyone in your family from India? Mmm.
 Pakistan.
 Pakistan. Now that's Well, isn't- a country somewhere, so What's the difference between that and- Yeah, what is Well, they're right next to each other, both countries. That's perfect. Perfect. That's close enough, dude. There's probably a lot of going back and forth. Yeah, Pakistanis are probably great with twists too, in their own kind of way, you know? Great. How'd you like to be in the movie business? Ma'am, how you doing on makeup in there? We're ready. Well, I'm okay, but I feel like maybe they used a little too much blood. Ma'am, we need to move here. Let's go. Let's go. My gut feeling is they went a little overboard. I mean, can you even tell that it's me? Yeah. It's perfect.
 We just need to pair you up with a husband for the shot.
 Husband? Yeah. How about this guy right here? That'll work. That'll work. [Cackles] Whoa! Great. Holy shit, Dee. This is like Wow. I could barely tell that was you.
 I mean, did they dip you by your heels into the blood?
 That's ridiculous. That looks so stupid. Uh Frank had 'em go a little more subtle with me, so you could see my face. This? This is it? Yeah. How the hell did you manage that? No, I'm working my ass of. Corpses, let's go now! Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go on, go on, go on. Go on. Go on, will ya? Whatever. Go ahead. Everybody focus. Get down now. Very simple shot. Lot to do today. Lot to do. I need all corpses lying down. We are losing light, people. Let's go.
 I need you to turn over. I need you face down.
 Face down? Yes. No, 'cause then you won't be able to see my face. Face down or in the pile of bodies over there. You pick it.
 Face down.
 That's what I thought. All right. Energy. Energy. But you're dead. Dead energy. Dead energy. Here we go. I get it. I get it. Okay, so he's on the edge of this cliff throwing his nose off into the ocean because he's at the happiest point of his life. No, no, no, no, no, no. This is the scientist's lowest point in the movie. Okay. Here. He throws his nose of the cliff into the ocean because he's- he's rejecting his life as a savior of all of mankind. Oh, I finally just got it. Oh, bro, that is Bro, that is- That's nice. Deep shit, man. That's awesome. That's awesome. It's nice.
 Where are you landing on the full penetration?
 I'm into it. Big time. The Injun says yes- Snaking around. So that's what we're doing, I guess. It's done. It's on. But, but, but- I-I- I mean, the title? Oh, yeah. The title. Title sucks. It's stupid, yeah. Come on. Title sucks, right? The Fifth Sense? I mean, stupid. Well, yeah.
 Who came up- Who came up with that?
 Uh Stupid. Come on, man. So stupid. You kidding? So why don't you type out this whole movie real quick, and we'll go sell it to Shyamalan. Yeah. Oh, no. I don't write. I'm a big picture kind of guy. You don't write. You don't write. Oh. [Cell Phone Ringing]
 Hello?
 Dennis, hey. We hit a wall on the pitch. Uh, what pitch is that, man?
 The pitch of the movie that you're a producer on.
 Oh, yeah. That thing. Yeah.
 What's up with that?
 We realized that none of us are writers, so we decided to play to our strengths and make a poster. What tells a person about a movie better than a picture of what the movie is? What are your thoughts? What are my thoughts? My thoughts are that's brilliant. I think it's cool. Cut! Huh? What are you doing?
Oh, shit. Were you guys rolling on that?
Yes. We were rolling on that. Do not talk on your phone during the shot. Okay? And you, ma'am?
 Oh, me?
 Do not roll over during the shot. Oh, I know, but you know what? I thought about it.
 I feel like it's better if I'm right side up.
 Back over. [Mocking] "Back over! Face down on the hot cement!"
 Let's roll it again, people.
 "Yeah, again!" [Machine Gun Fire, Explosions In Distance] [Machine Gun Fire] Brains! Brains! [Cell Phone Ringing] Cut! Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut! What the hell are you doing? Huh? You. Why are you saying "brains"? What Oh, 'cause it's a zombie movie. It's, like, the Shyamalan twist. I figured it out. This is not a zombie movie. It's a movie about Serbian genocide. [Ringing Continues] Really? Huh. You! Sir! Yes, sir. Your phone, it's ringing. Oh, yeah. I know. But listen, man. If you don't let me answer it and solve my boys' problems, the phone's gonna ring. You can't have it both ways. Can I talk or not? Yeah. I gotta agree with him on that one, buddy. You're not being very clear. Which is it? Turn your phone of! You, miss! Don't improvise! Let's go! Okay! You know what? I have had about enough of you dicking me around all day. Okay? Where is M. Night? I have questions for him. Yeah. Oh, no. Mr. Shyamalan isn't directing this unit. This is a simple pickup shot. Hold on a second. Hold on a second. Where the hell is M. Night? He's not here? No. What the hell's going on here?
 Well, he won't get of his phone, for starters.
 Give me your phone, Dennis. What? Give me your phone. All right. I heard that. No, I'll tell you exactly what's going on. This guy's been treating me like a dickwad all day long, and I don't appreciate it. [Assistant] Ha, ha, ha! All right. I'm gonna fix it, hon. Thank you. Fire both of them and I'll take their spot. What?
 Done. You're both fired.
 Hold on a second. What are you talking about, Frank? Being an agent is crap. I want to be an extra, lay around doing dick. Great. Both of you, get your shit out of the tent. Get out of here. All right, fine. Hey, give me my phone back, Frank. What? Just to be clear, pal. I don't care about any of this. I got my own thing going on, so [Groans] I just gave you the old Shyamalan twist. Oh, maybe you did, maybe you didn't, but I'll tell you what. I don't care either. All right. What do I do? Hey-oh! Hey, where his he, dude? Where's Night? We got it! Dude, we totally got it. Brace yourself! Brace yourself! Crime Stinks: The Smell of Penetration. "He nose the truth." Oh, okay, yeah. I get it. Get it? Yeah, I-I get it. Now, there is a lot going on there with- with Dolph. We had to make some artistic compromises. I think we're good with the body. Yeah, but it's a lovable character. It's a lovable guy. You know, these are good compromises. Bottom line, M. Night's gonna love it. So where is he? Night? Uh, well- Oh, he's not here. Jesus Christ, Dee. What happened to you? He brought in a "B" team or something like that, covered me all in blood. That slumdog bastard twisted all of us! Oh, shit, dude. We need him to execute our script. Yeah. Actually, you guys don't need Shyamalan to execute your script because I've got the mother of all Shyamalan twists in my hand right here. You see, you think I've just been playing with my phone the whole time, but you're wrong. Been writing a little movie script of my own, and I finished it right before you guys called. It's a horror movie about two men trapped in a garage stairwell who get hunted down by a psychotic, homeless killer who turns out to be a security guard instead.
 That's our story, dude.
 Damn right, it's your story. And that's why you two guys are gonna be attached as producers. Nice, baby! Producers! All right! I feel like that's I'm a natural born producer. I love showbiz, dude. I love showbiz. Uh, can I be in it? Uh, you know, normally, Dee, I would take this opportunity to insult you, but I'm gonna throw an insane twist your way. You're gonna be the lead of the film. I am? Really? No, you're not. Twisted again! Boom! Try and keep up. Lot of twists. Lot of twists in this thing, so try and keep up. There's so many twists, I can't even follow it. It's tough to follow. I'm gonna pull up the first scene so you guys can get a taste of what else is going on in this film. Yeah. Lay us on it. It's really good. Uh- For some reason the phone is frozen- Lay it on us. And I'm having a little trouble pulling up the scene And why is there grease all over Is this Frank's g- goddamn sausage grease? Frank, you froze my phone with your sausage greasy fingers! Frank, you son of a bitch! [Machine Gun Fire, Explosions In Distance] [Machine Gun Fire] [Assistant] Cut! Cut! For the love of Christ! [Voices Speaking Backwards]                        [Frank] Hey, hey! What do you think of these, guys? [Mac] My God, Frank. My God. You look ridiculous in those, dude. Dude, why are you wearing skinny jeans? Because they're hip. And I want to stay young. Well, stay old, bro. Because that looks terrible. Dress your age. I like 'em. I think they make me look sexy. [Laughs] I am getting a tremendous amount of enjoyment watching you parade around in those things.
 So I say keep them.
 Yeah?
 Yeah. It's like a Humpty Dumpty vibe going on with those. I don't know if you want Yo-oh! Big news, bitches! The ban's been lifted. And we are back in. Flipadelphia, here we come! Ohh! Flip, flip, Flipadelphia! Flip, flip, Flipadelphia! Flip! Flip! Flip- Yeah! Adelphia! What the hell is Flipadelphia? What is Flipadelphia? Dude, it's a city-wide flip cup tournament. It's the best. Yeah. We were the bar to beat Yeah. They very, very unfairly accused us of poisoning our rival team. Yes. You got framed? No, we did poison the shit out of them. But they didn't have any proof. So you have a rival? Oh, yeah, big-time. This dive bar down the street called Molly's. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. This year we're gonna jam it right up their butt holes. Ohh! Wow. Yeah, me, Dennis and Charlie will jam their butt holes. You're not gonna come anywhere near their butt holes. Let us handle the butt holes. What are you talking about? You guys, I- I'm your number four. I'm your "Adelphia. " And you can't- Yeah, I know. But, Dee, I mean, what, do you, like, not remember the past? You choked under pressure in '98. You blew the whole thing. We were gonna win. And then you couldn't flip your damn cup over. I know, Charlie! That's why I've been practicing ever since. I mean, you gotta give me a chance to redeem myself. Okay, fine. You will have a chance to redeem yourself. In the meantime, what do you say we throw a little gas on the rivalry fire? [Frank] I thought you said this place was a shithole. Yeah, it was. But looks like they've made a few renovations. All right, well, let's not get ahead of ourselves. Could be a scheme. Okay, you guys ready? Probably, yeah. Guess who, bitches! [Shouting] Are you guys hungry, huh? Enjoying your meals? Oh, yeah! Whoo! Oh, everybody have some lemon on it. Yeah. Honk, honk, honk. Eat it! Eat it! Eat it! Eat it! Will they highest ranking member of the staff please step forward? I'm, uh, Art Sloan. I'm the owner. Huh? [Laughing] Uh, you're Art Sloan? Now see, you look very different from what I remember. Do I know you people? Uh, allow me to refresh your memory. Ohh! Whoa, whoa. What- What the hell is that? Flip cup. Ten years ago? We poisoned you, dude. Remember? Oh, wait a minute, yeah. We got really sick. Yeah. You acted sick. But check it out. Who's to say we didn't put that very same poison in the drinking water?
 [All Groaning]
 Hey, everybody, relax. He's lying. He doesn't have any poison. No, I don't have any on me. But I do keep some in my fridge at home in the relish jar. There's poison in that jar? I thought I was allergic to pickles. What's in the jar with the skull and crossbones? Oh, that's mayonnaise. That's a decoy.
 And the mayo?
 That's shampoo. You're telling me I've been putting shampoo on my sandwiches? If you're using the mayonnaise, yeah, probably. I-I'm sorry. Is there something that I can do for you people? Yeah! We came to tell you we're reigniting the rivalry, dick worm.
 It's back on, bitch!
 You know what? I-I am not your rival, okay? I never was. And I am certainly not participating in Flipadelphia. Flip, flip, Flipadelphia! Flip, flip- Oh! Looks like someone's scared, guys. Now you're just being childish. [Dee] Oh, yeah? How's this for childish, bro? [Urinating] All right, that's it! I'm calling the cops. He pissed on your bar! Yeah, call the cops! See you Saturday. Don't be late. Three, two, one, go! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go! No, no. [All Shouting] No, you're doing it too high! Get it! Get it! What are you doing? What are you doing? I don't know, you guys. I was That was terrible! I'm sorry, okay? I thought you had been practicing. I have been practicing! I don't know what happened! You know, it's her bison-sized fingers! I don't have bison fingers! I don't have bison fingers. Oh, yes, you do. Your mother had to have a C-section because of those hands. Okay, you guys are just all screaming in my face! People are going to scream at the tournament! That's it. She's off the team. Shut up, Frank! You're not even on the team! That's true. What is my role here? Why did you bring that up? Yeah. All right. You're not gonna be on the flip cup team. No. Definitely not. Maybe you could be, um, team instigator. Yeah! There we go. That works. I'll be the instigator. Sure. Yeah. Okay. I'll instigate. In the meantime, we need to find a replacement for Dee. We need a replacement. No! No, no, no, no, no! That's not fair, you guys. Don't replace me! You're being replaced. Okay. I'll tell you what, Dee. If you can prove to us that you can flip 10 cups in a row under pressure, you're back on the team. Yes! Okay, I gotta practice. That's all I need. All right. I gotta warm up. You see, I went into this cold. I came in here cold. That's what my problem was. One mistake and you're off the team. That oughta keep her busy for at least a week or so. I don't think she'll ever get that. Okay, in the meantime, let's find a replacement. Yes. And I know just the place to go. Where? Same place I learned to hone my God-given flip cup skills. The Delta Omega Lambda fraternity house at Penn. Wait. That was, like, 15 years ago. I don't think you'd have any clout there. It doesn't matter, man. I was the king of that place. I'm a legend over there. Oh. This brings me back. Got the alumni's up here. Nice. [Chuckles] Oh, man. This is the class. Oh, man. There's Ritter. Oh, that's- "I chug dick"? No. What? I never- I don't chug dick. That's crazy. Why would you even put- That's not funny. Come on, that's homophobic. I mean, come on. What the hell? Bitch! Pick it back up! [Man] No, shake the ass! Shake the ass! [All Shouting] Yeah, there you go!
 Like this!
 Frank? What the hell are you doing, man? I'm recruiting these guys for the flip cup thing. I almost got this, Dennis. Whoo-whoo-whoo! Yeah! All right! That's real funny shit, Frank! Step out for a second and let me handle this. All right, guys- [Laughs] I'm Brother Reynolds, class of '98. Dude, we were cruising in sixth grade in '98, man. Oh, sixth grade? Cool, man. Well, I guess I kind of blazed the trail for these sorts of shenanigans you guys got going on in here.
 What's going on with this kid?
 Oh, he's a pledge. And we're zapping his nuts with a stun gun every couple of hours.
 Oh!
 Look at him, man! That's brutal, man. Wow. Let me- Let me get in on that. You- You want to get in on this? Yeah. I'm sort of a legend when it comes to this kind of shit. So, yeah.
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Cool. Cool. Here, man.
 [All Laughing]
 Down he goes!
 Oh, shit! That really hurts! Dennis, these guys are badass shitheads! Oh, man! You got any ludes? Ludes? I don't think they make those anymore, man. No? We got Ritarall. Ritarall? Yeah. What's Ritarall? Oh, snortski. Ohh. Mmm. [Inhales] Ooh! Ooh, that's tasty stuff. Uh, God. Zap him again. Huh? [Screams]
 It's that- It's that easy.
 Don't do that shit again, you little idiot! Okay? Have some respect for a brother, okay? I'm a legend around this place. So don't zap me again! All right, listen. I came here for a reason, okay? I came here to recruit you for a flip cup tournament. Flip cup? Flip cup? What are you, a freshman? That is so lame. Take a look at how loose his jeans are. Okay. Okay.
 [Screaming]
 Let me have it a minute. [Screaming] No more zapping. All right, all right. No more zapping. We're done. [Dennis] Stop, stop, stop! [Screaming] [Frank] Get outta here! [Dee] All right, focus. You can do this. One more time, just- Oh, Dee. Dee, it's getting hard to watch. Really. I can't stop grinding my teeth. I don't know how these kids study on this goddamn Ritarall. Yeah, I don't know either! And I don't give a shit! Hey. So how did the recruiting go? Oh, it was bad. We both got punked. Yeah, we both got punked, Frank. We both got punked! That's right. These kids these days, I'll tell you what. They're nothing like we used to be back when we were in fraternities. They have no respect for anybody, okay? They're like stupid little goddamn savages. They're bitches! They're bitches! They're little bitches. I came in there, right? And I was polite, and I was nice to them. I was cordial. And they completely goddamn disrespected me! Little idiots! Idiots! Yeah. I was completely respectful. They're supposed to be my brothers, right? They're my brothers? No, no. That's not fun. What they were doing wasn't fun. They kept zapping us and zapping us. Idiots! Savages! Idiots! No, zap, zap, zap, zap. Idiots! Jesus Christ, dude. Calm down. Man, that's- All right, I'm just They disrespect- I am a legend over there! I know you're a legend. Charlie knows you're a legend, you know? Yeah. That's just the viciousness of youth. That wasn't fun! It's not fun! It's not fun! Savages! I'll tell you what, dude. Maybe you should step down from the fraternity thing. Look, we haven't gotten Art Sloan to sign up yet. He has not signed up. Why don't you focus some of that weird rage on him?
 Charlie and I'll handle the frat kids from here, okay?
 Yeah, yeah. I'll totally pull a Good Will Hunting on those kids and that'll put 'em in their place. How are you gonna do that? Well, you've seen the movie, right? Yeah. So all I gotta do is I'll ask them some like big shot, like, math or science, history-type college question and then I'll totally stump them by knowing a lot more about the answer than they do. Yeah, in that movie, Matt Damon played a genius janitor. You're just a janitor. Right. [Chuckles] You stumped me with that one. That's a good point. You didn't have a comeback for that. How are you gonna have a comeback in the frat house? Then you ask them the math or history-type question Ah, but you're not a janitor. Don't do that. Just, please, please take care of those little savages. Got it. Don't do that. Don't do that. It'll work if you just say some lines from the movie. It works. Flip. That's too big. That's too big. [Chattering]  [Techno] Oh! Oh, my. What is going on in here, dude? Oh, my. Woo-hoo-hoo! Jesus Christ. It's like some kind of paint party. Yeah! They're painting each other up! Is this what college is like, man? I don't know, man. I wish I went to college. I feel like I got boned big-time, dude! Jesus Christ. Hey. Oh, my God, yo! You're painting him? Hey! That's nice. Yeah! Jesus Christ, Charlie. Oh, my God, dude. Oh, my God. They're painting each other. No! No, no, no! Charlie! Stay focused, dude. Right! Stay focused. We gotta find guys for the team. Right, right, right! Nothing will distract us. Nothing! Okay. Do not get distracted. [Together] Hey! [Together] Hi! Do you want to paint us up? Yes. Uh, paint you up? How? Yes. Well, first we paint you, and then you paint us. Well, that makes sense. Sure. Yeah, uh- Yeah. Yeah. How do we do the painting? [Laughs] With our hands. We do. Yeah. Yeah, we do. [Laughing] Awesome. Sorry. Excuse us. Uh, are you ready? Yeah. No, we're ready. We're ready. [Frank] Artie Sloan. Tying his shirts in knots! I like to humiliate guys, sure. I'm no different than those guys are now, man. Yeah! You know? Like, I used to be the same way. I used to dress guys up like bananas and walk them around the quad. Or I'd take a banana and stick it up some guy's ass in front of his best friend. And I'd be like, "Hey! Banana ass! How you doing?" Or maybe I'd, like, uh- I'd like take the tip of my penis and stick it in a guy's mouth for, like, just a second, you know what I mean? Like while he was sleeping. [Laughing] I'm all about that shit! You know what I mean? But you don't stun gun a guy who was a goddamn legend! No! And those guys, they need to recognize that shit! I was a- I was a trailblazer! But these kids these days in fraternities, it's like they don't have any respect. They don't care about anybody but themselves, you know? And I don't understand that. It's like they live in a fantasy world, where, "Oh, no. There's no consequences for my actions. "I can do whatever the hell I want! And treat people however the hell I want to treat 'em!" [Flushes] And I don't get that. What are you doing, Frank? What is that? Well, what I'm doing is I'm cutting the shower curtain in half waist high so that when he's in using it, people can see his junk. Wow, Frank. That Ritarall's having a very interesting affect on what you think. I love this feeling! Yeah! Got any more of it? Does a bear shit in the woods? Well, cut up a couple of rails, buddy! I'm gonna blast off! All right. Here you go. All right. [Dennis] Let's do this! And we're done! [Charlie and Mac] Ohh! [Laughing] That was awesome. Oh, that's so awesome. That's so awesome. And now you do us. Oh, man! Yeah. And then for the best part. There's a better part than this? There can't be a better part. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. How? When we shower together and wash each other off. Yeah, we do. Whoo! [Chuckles] That's exactly what we're gonna do. What do you two clowns think you're doing? That's awesome. Nah, it's cool, man. We're good. We're good. No! You assholes gotta go! No, man. Come on. Yeah, man. Yeah, you do. You do, man. You do. Come on, man. Hey. Hey, guys. I'm telling you no, dude. I'm telling you no. Guys. Guys. Guys. We're trying to have a conversation, please. No! You're not in the frat. Get out! Guys, you're killing me. I'm gonna pull a Good Will Hunting. No, no, Charlie. What's your major, dude? Economics. Oh! Bet you're reading a lot of Gordon Wood, huh! You read your Gordon Wood and you regurgitate it from a textbook and you think you're wicked awesome doing that! And how about them apples? And all that Gordon Wood business! I have no idea what you're talking about. You are an idiot. You are an idiot. Does no one know who Gordon Wood is? You know what, Cheesefoot? Go get the stun gun. That's a great idea. That's a great idea. Shit. [Both Sighing] [Crickets Chirping] [Frank] Oh, yeah! Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank! Dude! I'm finished! Oh, yeah! I'm finished. What are you doing? What do you got going on? What are you doing? I'm doing this jerk-off's taxes! Next year the I.R.S. Will audit the piss out of him! Oh! That's so weird! That's so- That's long-term shit. I would- Yes! I like that! I like that! Yes. Good. Do me a favor, man. Can you go upstairs and look down onto the lawn? I've done it. I've done it. I've done something. You've done it? Yeah. Give me the cigar. I need that. What'd you do? I have done "it." What? [Exhales] I've created a masterpiece. [Frank] Wow. I think our work here is done. It's so unfair, dude. Oh, yeah, dude. So unfair! I mean, like, if I had known college was anything like that, the amount of book learning I would have put to my brain- Read! And math, dude! To get there and stay there. They shower together! And naked. Oh! Boom! The rivalry's back on, boys! It is back on! The rivalry's back on? Oh, yeah! It's back on! All right! Rivalry! Rivalry. [All] Rivalry. Rivalry. Rivalry. Rivalry. Rivalry. Rivalry. [Sighs] Goddamn it. This feels forced. I I'm not into it. I'm definitely forcing it. Why is that? Something's off! Something's off, dude! You know what it is for me? I can only speak for myself. But it's those goddamn punk-ass frat kids, man. They got to me, dude. They really got to me! They burned me and I haven't let it go. Dude! They burned us too, man! Did they burn you guys?
 Is that why you're painted like that?
 Yeah, what's going on? They have like this magical thing going on. Things are different now. Hey, you guys. Watch this. Oh! Hey! Oh! Oh! Ohh! Ohh! Oh! [Cheering] Ten in a row! Nice! With everybody watching! This guy! This guy! Holy shit! That was amazing, Dee! And you just gave me a thought, okay?
 I think we need to rethink who our rivals are.
 What do you mean? Well, bro, the Art Sloan-Molly's rivalry, that's, like, 10 years old! That's old shit, man! I think our new rivals are those punk-ass frat kids!
 Dude, those guys are dicks.
 They're such dicks, man! And I think with Dee's newfound flip cup skills, we can embarrass the shit out of those little bitches! I'll tell you what. I will take any excuse to get back to that party. Okay! That's it! It's a rivalry! The new rivalry!  [Techno]
 What do you guys want?
 We want one game of flip cup. If you guys win, you get to drink at our bar forever, for free. If we win, we get to come to your frat whenever we want.
 [Charlie] And paint girls!
 And get painted by them! And take showers with them! Lots of showers. Okay. You're on. All right. These guys are gonna be really fast. So we need to get on to a quick lead. Dee, I want you to start us off. Really? Yes. Charlie, you're gonna take us home as the anchor. Naturally. All right. Oh, you guys. You guys, I am not gonna let you down, okay? I know you're not, Sis. I'm proud of you. We're really proud of you. Frank, you want to start us of with some kind of cheer? Yeah, that's a good idea. Paddy's! Paddy's! Paddy's! Yeah! Whoo! All right! All right! Okay, both teams ready? Yeah! Go! Go, Dee! Go, Dee! Go, Dee!
 Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
 Come on, Dee! Come on! Don't think so hard! Don't think so hard!
 Hold on!
 [Charlie] Come on, Dee! Let's go! [Dennis] Come on! Come on, Dee! Come on, Dee! Ease up on it, Dee! Ease up! [Mac] Too hard! You're hitting yourself in the head. Come on, Dee! What are you doing, Dee? What are you doing? Oh, come on! Come on! Dee! Come on, Dee! [Cheering] No!
 Your beer, free for us, for life!
 For life! You guys, I'm sorry. You guys, one more time. Let's just challenge them to one more! You know what I mean? I feel like we could really get these guys! Don't you see, Dee?
 We've already won.
 [Laughing] What does that mean? What are you talking about? Ohh! Oh, God. [Stomach Gurgling] Hey, what- Whoa. What's going on with me? Oh, what's going on is that you just drank a cup of poison! [All Shouting] Paddy's Pub, bitches! [Stomachs Gurgling]
 You guys poisoned the beer?
 Yes, Dee, we did poison the beer. That was the only way we could beat these little bitches! I thought you guys believed in me. You were so proud of me. Oh, no. We knew you were gonna choke. Yeah. Yeah. We knew you'd pretty much choke under pressure. Which is why- We poisoned your ass! Flip, flip, Flipadelphia! Flip, flip, Flipadelphia! Flip, flip, Flipadelphia! Flip, flip, Flipadelphia! Flip, Flipadelphia! Flip, flip, Flipadelphia! Flip, flip, Flipadelphia! [Frank] Pull! Yank! Rip 'em off! Pull 'em of! Yank em! Yank 'em! They're not coming off! Yank 'em! Yank 'em! We're gonna have to burn 'em off, I think. No! Gotta get 'em off 'cause I got no circulation in my legs. Yeah, I don't know. You've got to be kidding me. Whoa-ho. Hey, hey, pump your brakes there, pal. Slow down for a second. What- What's your problem exactly? What- What's my problem? Okay, you know what? You disrespected my business. You vandalized my home. All in the name of some stupid drinking competition. And then when I finally cave in, you don't even show up. Show up for what? Well Flipadelphia! Oh, Flipadelphia! Oh, sh Was that today? Yeah, dude. Okay, you know what? I want a challenge. Okay? My bar. Flip cup. Today. Let's go! Nah. We've moved on. Yeah, I'm over it. You know what? That's gonna be a pass for me too. Yeah. I don't feel well at all. They poisoned me. I'm not feeling it either. So that's gonna be a unanimous no from us. Sorry. God!
 Hey, now.
 Come on, man. What was that? Totally uncalled for.
 Who slams a door?
 Babies. That guy's got some real growing up to do. I mean, have some respect, for Christ's sake. Goddamn savage. I am a legend.                     When you come face-to-face with something like that what are you supposed to do? You just have to laugh.
 Hey, buddy.
 Yeah, what's going on there, pal? Oh, my God. I just found a rat's nest. Slaughtered about 200 of 'em. Two-Two hundred? Couldn't be. That's
 Jesus Christ. It's like
 It's like whole generations of those things have died at my hands, and
 mothers, fathers, grandfathers, little baby rats. Oh, yeah.
 Wow.
 Well, you know, keep up the good work. Yeah. Sometimes I wonder though if our lives are really more valuable than theirs.
 You know what I mean?
 Yeah.
 They are.
 Yeah.
 Our lives are, definitely. Yeah.
 Without a doubt.
 Yeah.
 Without a doubt. If that makes you feel any

 Yeah, well

 Mm-hmm. I suppose I oughta
 Get back to it?
 Yep.
 Jump right back in there, tiger. Get on the horse, Charlie. Bash. Bash 'em up.
 Do what you do best.
 All right. Thanks, guys.
 I just gotta go the bathroom.
 Sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 All right, man. He touched me with it.
 Ugh! God, what a life, huh?
 Today's his birthday.
 Are you kidding me?
 Poor guy- on a day like this.
 Oh, my God. We ought to do something nice for him.
 Definitely. Yeah. Absolutely.
 Mm-hmm.
 Oh. You wanna get him a new rat stick?
 That's a good idea. I was thinking maybe we should throw him a surprise party. He is really bummed. I guess we could do something nice for him. Definitely. For one day let's make the poor bastard feel special. For one day, let's make this lowly rat killer feel like a king. Yes. In the simplest

 Easiest way.
 Easiest
 I'm tired today, you know? Here it is. I got it. I'm thinking we go with a Hawaiian trip-hop
 Underground luau theme.
 What?
 Hmm?
 What even is that? Charlie's been hanging around with this guy Duncan from under the bridge and he runs with this rough crowd and they're all into this Hawaiian underground shit, you know? And I made a little list of stuff that would really support that theme. "Fill bar with sand. Roast wild pig. Invite Duncan and crew." Ooh, this seems like a whole lot of work.
 Does anybody really even like surprise parties anyway?
 I don't. What the hell's the matter with you? How did you get so cynical?
 Cynical?
 You can't even get excited to give your friend a party. Giving somebody a birthday party
 a surprise party
 is one of the greatest things you can do for him.
 Okay, Frank, all right, all right.
 All right. Well, maybe we are being a little cynical. Clearly, this means a lot to you, so fine.
 We'll jump on board with the party. What's the plan?
 Okay.
 The plan is you guys execute this list.
 Mm-hmm. I am gonna take Charlie to the spa for a day to distract him. Hold on. Why do you get to spend the day at a spa while we do all the legwork? Because I got these two coupons in the mail. Okay, I'm pregnant, and you haven't offered me coupons or spa days or roasted pigs or surprises or any of those fun things. Oh, oh, okay. Well, in the interest of not being cynical and doing shit for other people I'm gonna suggest that we give the two coupons to Dee and she does the spa thing.
 Surprise.
 Perfect. Thank you. All right, cool. I will take this coupon and sneak out the back so Charlie doesn't see me.
 Oh, wait, wait. What? What?
 What? No, you have to take Charlie with you to the spa.
 That's the whole thing. You have to distract him. That's Oh, shit. Yeah. Frank, you might be right about us getting cynical. I just
 I just jumped straight to default and was gonna throw this second coupon in the trash.
 Right.
 But the Charlie thing
 We're doing the Charlie thing. Okay. I got it. I'm on it. Okay. Hey, Charlie! Hey, listen, uh, you've been really stressed so I thought I would take you for a spa day, just you and me. A what day?
 A spa day.
 What is this word "spa"? I feel like you're starting to say a word and you're not finishing it. Are you trying to say "spaghetti"? Are you taking me for a spaghetti day? No, Charlie, I wasn't trying to take you for a spaghetti day. Oh, God, you know what? It doesn't matter. It's okay. That's all right. I'm doing something nice here. Tell you what. Let's go to a movie. Wanna go to a movie? Dee, I go to a movie or a spaghetti place with you, and out there, I'm the rat. What if I guarantee you that nobody out there will put you into a bag and bash you against a telephone pole? Would that comfort you at all? No. That's a guarantee you can't make, Dee, all right?
 I'll tell you what.
 That's why I'm building this little puppy.
 Yeah. Don't do- Okay.
 And no one's getting bashed. If you don't come with me to the movie I'm gonna take this raccoon of yours and bash it into a telephone pole. No! I can't take any more bashing today, all right?
 Let's go. This will be fun.
 All right, let's go.
 Dennis.
 Yeah? Check that box of tiki torches. Start setting those up.
 What, this?
 Yeah, that box there.
 What is this? We didn't put this in here.
 Surprise!
 What is that? What'd you do?
 I got you a present, bro. I'm trying to be less cynical. And Frank is totally right. The surprise is the way to go.
 So you got me a gift.
 Yes. While we were picking up the decorations, I slipped out and I got you something I think you're gonna like.
 Okay, all right.
 Okay.
 Ah!
 Oh! Oh! Shirt! I love this shirt. That's great, man. Thank you.
 This isn't the shirt that I picked out.
 Yeah. No. Well, no.
 What is this?
 It's the shirt that I- that I picked out. But that's cool. Here's the thing, man. I
 I got a little suspicious when you slipped out earlier and so I followed you into the store and I saw that you were about to make a really bad choice and then you did make that choice and you bought that other shirt. It was a bad shirt. It was an ugly shirt- hideous really. So I grabbed that shirt out of the bag when you weren't looking and I returned it and I bought myself this shirt, which isn't hideous.
 And so, surprise.
 That was a good shirt. No. This brings me no joy at all. I feel nothing. I feel like you just stole money from me and then you bought yourself a
 Shirt.
 A shirt with your money.
 Yeah.
 Well, that is what happened. That is a ridiculous price, and you know it. Supposing I bought a pig unseasoned and dressed it myself? Then what? What then? Well, that's not what Jerry Carelli said, asshole. Ha! Pitting two pig dealers against each other.
 Ah, sure.
 Frank, are you sure about this luau thing?
 It's a ton of work.
 Yeah. Does Charlie even know what a luau is? I doubt Charlie can even say the word "luau." How do you know that this is what he wants? Well, because I read it in his dream book.
 His what? His dream book?
 Yeah. Charlie keeps a book of dreams and aspirations. They're mostly in pictures and symbols but he has been obsessing about this luau thing since we met Duncan under the bridge. Okay, now, my first instinct when you say things about meeting people under bridges is to berate you for hanging out with people under a bridge and to say to you, "Why do you hang out with these people? You and Charlie shouldn't be asso-" But I'm not gonna say anything because I don't wanna be cynical anymore. I'm not gonna say anything. I'm

 Maybe the bridge is exciting.
 The bridge is awesome. Ooh. It's probably pretty cool. Ooh. Hold on a second. Hey. It's the other pig guy. Ha. So you come crawling back, you cheap sack of shit. You can't bring food into the theater. Hmm? Oh, no, I'm not.
 I-I bought it over there with that food.
 No, you didn't. How do you know that? Because we don't serve spaghetti and I just watched you walk in with it. You called my bluff, sir. I shall dispose of this posthaste. A moment, please. Dee, pop this into your purse real quick. No. Absolutely not. No. Why did you have to bring spaghetti
 You got me hankering for spaghetti and I want it.
 Just eat it fast and we'll go.
 No. I wanna enjoy it and watch the movie.
 It's gonna make a mess in my purse.
 I'm leaving
 Because the spaghetti is the whole deal for me.
 Goddamn it. Just put it in. Be careful. This is so stupid.
 And there we go! Got rid of it.
 Great. Thank you. Okay. Look at this place, Dee. Look at the size of this place.
 What does 3D even stand for?
 Third dimension. Just- Please stop talking. Third dimen- What dimension are we in? Shh. Charlie, I don't know. Isn't stuff supposed to pop out at us? I don't know. I'm not sure. Let's watch and find out. Whoa!
 Did you see that?
 Yeah, I saw that. That came right at you. Is this safe?
 Are you kidding me?
 Well, I don't know. Take the glasses off if you're uncomfortable, okay?
 But then everything's blurry.
 Then put the glasses on and shut the hell up.
 Shh.
 You shh. See, stuff's not safe. Uh-oh. Whoa. What happened to my meatball?
 Would you shut up?
 Oh, no.
 I bet it flew off when I

 Okay, you are a sleuth. You've gotten to the bottom of it. That's very exciting.
 Now shut up.
 Let me just find it. I'm sorry.
 Charlie, sit down.
 Did you see a meatball over here? If you don't sit down and shut up and watch the movie I'm gonna attack you. I don't care how pregnant I am, I'm gonna attack you.
 I got it. I got it.
 You got it? Good. Sit down.
 Got the meatball.
 Sit down!
 Quiet down!
 The movie's boring. You- How would you
 You're not watching the movie. Uh-oh.
 You're not gonna like this.
 What happened?
 Ah, nuts. Some spaghetti spilled in your purse a little bit.
 Oh, shit. Want your spaghetti, Charlie? You want your spaghetti?
 Here's your spaghetti.
 Oh, don't dump it on the ground like that.
 Shut up and watch the movie.
 I don't wanna shut up and watch the movie. Can't eat spaghetti. Can't follow the movie. Doesn't make sense.
 I'm going back to the bar. I'm taking the spaghetti.
 Go to the bar.
 Excuse me.
 Shut up! Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me? Dude, I just saw another rat. There's definitely a ton of rats in here, that's for sure. I see him.
 Oh, shit.
 We gotta distract him.
 I'll tell him the keg exploded.
 That's a stupid idea.
 That's a stupid idea. We're going with the burst pipe.
 I like the keg idea. Your ideas are so stupid. Go with the burst pipe. That would never happen.
 Whatever. We gotta go.
 A keg would never explode. Hey, Charlie! Charlie! Charlie boy! Hey, where'd you get those glasses, bud? Oh, these? They're just, like, third-dimension glasses, you know? Don't really work though, 'cause I feel like I'm still seeing stuff in whatever dimension we live in.
 Uh, right.
 Yeah. You can't really go in the bar right now, bro.
 Why not?
 A keg exploded.
 A pipe

 Yeah. Holy shit. Can that happen? A piece of metal flew off the keg and hit Dennis in the dick. Holy shit! Are you okay? Yeah. No, I-I'm fine. I got lucky. It mashed right into it. We all thought he was gonna lose it. Charlie, it lumped it up and mangled it like a chicken potpie down there.
 Oh, God.
 Dickless Dennis.
 No. It's totally fine.
 That's what we should call him- Dickless Dennis. Oh, Dickless Dennis. But it doesn't apply because my dick totally went back to normal, and it's fine now.
 I'll show it to you.
 I don't wanna see it.
 Moving on, how was the spa?
 Spa? Sp- Uh- Oh, spaghetti. How's my spaghetti? Dee threw it on the floor. The spa. The spa that Dee took you to. Oh, no, she took me to a movie. Yeah, it was lame. I couldn't understand it. Made no sense. That cynical bitch. Hello. I would like to redeem this coupon.
 Go ahead and toss this one in the trash for me.
 Busted! See?
 You're busted, Dee.
 What?
 What are you guys doing here?
 I'm taking Charlie to the spa because he's stressed. A keg exploded in the bar. Blew Dennis's dick off.
 No, no. My dick is fine, Dee.
 It's a mess down there. It's a monster.
 Let me have those coupons.
 No. You said I could have them. Dee, you were supposed to take Charlie. I tried to take Charlie, but he refused to go. What is your spaghetti policy here? Are you hearing this? Are you hearing this?
 He doesn't belong in a place like this.
 All right, come on. We're wasting time. Go get Duncan and the bridge crew and bring them to the bar.
 I'll occupy Charlie.
 No. Where's the robes? I think this is it, right here.
 This is sketchy as hell.
 Yeah. Hey. Um, yeah, we're looking for Duncan.
 Oh, let's go.
 Oh, yeah, we should take that as a sign, right? Come on in. Yeah? You pregnant. Come on now.
 What is happening in here?
 I don't know.
 Come on now.
 All right. Mr. Duncan, we were wondering if we could talk to you about
 I ain't no Duncan. It's this nigga right here about to go level three and shit.
 What's up?
 Oh, you're Duncan. Mr. Duncan, we were wondering if you could come to a surprise party for Charlie. Who? Charlie. He's Frank's friend. You guys have all been hanging out under a bridge. Oh, yeah. Frank. I know that bitch. Okay. Hey, listen. Frank mentioned that you might be willing
 Oh, shit! Level three, son! Yo! Level three! Guys, come over here. This is bizarre, okay? Charlie should not have anything to do with these people. They are deranged. Frank has too much influence over this whole thing, all right?
 I think we gotta stop and think about what Charlie wants.
 Yeah. We need to get our hands on Charlie's dream book and figure out what that kid wants ourselves.
 Mother pus bucket!
 You piece of shit! You broke my wall! What I tell you? Huh, son?
 Should we call the police?
 No, no. Let's just go.
 Let's get the hell out of here.
 All right. Charlie, let's go. Get in here.
 Oh! Ooh!
 Whew! Hey, guys, the management needs everybody to get out because they caught a guy jerking off in here and they're gonna send in a crew to wipe down the loads. Go ahead. Go on. Let's go. God, it's terrible. It's really disgusting. Ah. Okay. Get rid of all the strange dongs.
 Oh.
 Yeah.
 A little bit.
 I don't get it, man. What's so relaxing about sitting around in a hot, wet room? It's all about opening up your pores, Charlie.
 Yeah.
 Take your robe off. Yeah. That's it. You got your clothes on. You gotta take your clothes off. What? No way, dude. I'm not getting naked in public. Suit yourself, all right?
 I am going to roast like a pig.
 All right. I'm gonna eat spaghetti. Oh, God. Whoa. Hey, guys, guys, guys. I bet you this is it. "Dram- Dram bach." I bet that means "dream book." Yeah. Look at this- pictures and symbols. I don't see anything about our stupid luau, but, uh, this looks weird.
 What do you make of that, guys?
 That looks like a drawing of a pair of jeans. A plus sign and a chicken. "Denim chicken." Denim chicken. Okay, guys, my gut is telling me to throw this book in the trash.
 Well, yeah.
 It's absolute nonsense. We're all feeling the same things, but we need to fight that instinct. We have to throw a party for Charlie. It's so simple.
 If we can't do that, what does that say about us?
 You're right. This isn't about us. Let's not be cynical. Let's do what the kid wants. If he wants a werm hat

 Worm hat.
 Worm hat. How do we get him a worm hat? I don't know what that is.
 Maybe there's a drawing or- What is that?
 That's a bird with teeth. It sure is. We don't have a lot of time. Let's figure out the best we can do.
 We can do it.
 We'll do these things. We'll do these things.
 Okay.
 Let's go. Okay. Dude, how much longer do we have to stay in here? Come on. Just relax. Take your clothes off. I feel trapped in here, Frank. I'm trapped like a rat. Holy shit, I'm trapped like a rat, aren't I?
 No, you're not, Charlie.
 I'm a rat in here! I'm a rat! I'm trapped like a
 I gotta get out of here.
 Calm down, Charlie. I'm tired of being in weird places, Frank, 'cause I'm trapped like a rat. Calm down, Charlie. Calm down. Relax. All right, all right.
 I gotta get out of here!
 Now calm down.
 How do I get this off?
 Take it easy. Charlie.
 Take it easy.
 Just bash me, Frank.
 I'm not gonna bash you, Charlie.
 Just bash me like a rat! Bash me like a rat and get it over with! Oh. Sorry, guys. Just let me know when you're done. I'm the guy who wipes down the loads. Hurry up.
 I'm not wearing this stupid thing, and that's it.
 It's a lei. Surprise! What the shit is this? Where's my luau?
 We went around you, Frank.
 Yeah.
 Happy birthday, Charlie.
 Happy birthday. Happy birthday? Oh. Is that why you guys were doing all that weird shit with me today? Yeah. We were trying to distract you so we could plan your party. Thanks, guys. Yeah. It's not my birthday though.
 Hmm?
 It's not your birthday?
 No.
 No, dicks. It's my birthday.
 Wha

 Are you kidding me?
 No, I'm not kidding you.
 Wait a second. Were you trying to get us to plan your surprise party? Why wouldn't you just plan it yourself? Well, that's lame. This way I get my surprise party and I give you the satisfaction of doing something nice for somebody.
 Oh, my God.
 That is not doing something nice. That is tricking us.
 Son of a bitch.
 Where's Duncan? You should not be hanging out with Duncan. You should not be associating with people like that. I'm saying it. I don't care. It's coming out of my mouth. Those weird bridge people that are like

 Yeah.
 Yeah. All that "hawwoowin lauow"?
 I knew he couldn't say it.
 Luau. Luau.
 What is it? Hello.
 Luau. Luau.
 It's not a word.
 Huh? What do we got going on over here, guys? Well, Charlie, when we thought it was your birthday we went through your dream book and we tried to re-create some of the stuff we found in there. Yes, that's okay. Um

 Denim chicken?
 Yes! Yeah, denim chicken.
 Now I got to reroute the pig delivery.
 Nobody gives a shit.
 So we also have the bird, with teeth.
 Yep. Wow! Okay. And I'm assuming the teeth are fake, yes? Yes. Well, they're not real human teeth, if that's what you're asking me. No, did you discover a bird with teeth in this fashion?
 That does not exist in nature.
 Okay. I'm not sure about that, but either way, good glue work. Do any of you assholes wanna know how old I am?
 Whatever, Frank.
 Nobody

 All right, so

 Charlie, this is my favorite part. We weren't quite sure what a worm hat was, right? So we made a few of 'em. This is the first one. It's a hat made of worms, okay? And then option number two is a hat that you put on. And when you do that, you look like maybe you're a worm.
 Like a worm, yeah.
 And then the third one- and this is the best one
 is a hat for your worm. Your teeny tiny little worm gets a teeny tiny little hat. If you want him to be fancy.
 So which one is it?
 Which one were you talking about? Well, I don't recall ever writing "worm hat." Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was in your dream book. Your
 Oh! "Wermhat." That's a German guy. His name's Hans Wermhat. He appears in my dreams. He drives a biplane and he shoots it at me, and I run through a field. You know what? You guys blow. I'm gonna go find Duncan.
 Go! Go!
 Get lost! Wow! Guys! Wow! The denim chicken, the bird with teeth, Wermhat's worm hat. I don't know what to say, man. This is just what I needed today. Guess what, buddy. There's one more thing. Is that what I think it is?
 That's a new rat stick, dude.
 Yeah. And you can bash up a whole bunch of rats with one quick strike
 So it's more humane.
 Yeah? Oh, man.
 What do you think?
 Oh, you like it?
 I love it. I mean

 Aw. I don't know what to say 'cause no one's ever really, um
 I don't know what to say, guys. You don't have to say anything, man. Maybe I could give it a quick whirl in the basement and see if I could kill a couple rats.
 Absolutely. You've earned it.
 You should. Go bash 'em up, buddy. Whoo!
 What a life.
 Yeah.                     Frank, I'd like to thank you for giving me the opportunity of a lifetime. Whatever. I hope they have some cool, exotic creatures for us to fiddle around with and play with. Dennis, we're going to an animal rights event.
 There's gonna be all sorts of exotic creatures there.
 You think so? Better have some cool stuff at this thing. I mean, the money I laid out for this charity, they could have built a zoo. Yeah. Actually, guys, zoos are animal prisons. I've been boning up on my animal rights literature so I can have some talking points with Chase. He's a big animal rights lover, and he's gonna be there. Security is not gonna let you go anywhere near Chase Utley, bro. Those creepy letters you've been writing him? You've gotta be on a list somewhere. What are you giving me shit for, okay?
 Dee's the one going after Ryan Howard all of a sudden.
 Well, so what? Why is that weird? That makes perfect sense.
 I'm a hot, single lady. He's a hot, single man.
 Hot? Dee, you're pregnant as shit.
 Frank, this shortcut sucks.
 It ain't a shortcut. Well, why in the hell are we in the woods? Get on the A.C. Expressway.
 It goes straight to Atlantic City.
 I'm avoiding tolls. Okay, hold on a second. You're willing to shell out tons of money for a charity and you can't spare a couple bucks for a toll road? What do you want me to do, give all my money to some toll jockey?
 Yeah!
 Just for riding on a street?
 Squirrel!
 What? Oh, thank God. That was close. Why did you do that, Mac? Goddamn it! You almost ran over that squirrel, Frank. So you should've let me mash it. It's just a dumb-ass squirrel. Hey, do not say stupid shit like that tonight at the animal rights event. But I can't wait to make my speech. I'm gonna get up there and lace into these liberal nut jobs. What? I thought you loved animals now. No. I only donated all this money so I could make a mockery of their cause. Animals should be food, rugs and trophies.
 Why do you think I'm wearing a leather suit?
 Are you? Is that leather?
 You bet your ass it's leather.
 Huh. I just assumed it was plastic.
 Who wears a plastic suit?
 I don't know, Frank. But I don't question the things you do anymore. Listen, I'm gonna call us a tow truck and get us out of here. I'm not getting any bars though. You getting any bars, Frank? I got nothin'. What gives?
 What gives is that we're in the middle of goddamn nowhere. What happened? Are we in A.C.? No, we're not in A.C. because Mac wrecked the car, and now we're stranded somewhere. Oh, man! "Come to Atlantic City," you said. "Let us tie you up and put a sack on your head so you don't freak out. That'll be a good adventure," you said. Well, I'm freaking out a little bit. Relax. Relax, Charlie. This is gonna be a great adventure. This is exciting. This is the unknown. This is all part of it, man. Well, it ain't a great adventure to me. Riding on a private jet, sipping champagne
 that's an adventure. Then why didn't you fly us in a private jet to A.C.? It's only 80 miles. You know how quick that trip would be? It'd be a total waste of money. This is why I don't leave Philly. You leave Philly, and bad shit happens. I mean, trees? Everywhere trees? What the hell is this place?
 I'm hitching a ride back home.
 Calm down, Char
 Let's all walk, and we'll find some help, okay? I'm not walking, 'cause I got a baby on board, my feet hurt. I'm not going anywhere 'cause this suit is, like, chafing me up like crazy. Oh, Jesus. All right. Mac and I and Charlie will go find some help. Okay? Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh! Except I'm not gonna go.
 I'm gonna hang back and oil up my glove.
 Your glo
 What is your endgame in this? I'm gonna have a catch with Chase Utley.
 Chase Utley is not gonna have a catch with you.
 Come on. Come on. Don't you say that, Charlie! Don't you say that! Listen. We're gonna find help.
 Hurry.
 Hurry up, guys. Hurry up. 'Cause I got to get to Chase. Does the air taste weird out here, or is it just me? No. It's just you. Listen, I know you have a lot of anxiety going on right now. But you gotta understand, we're both in uncharted waters here. Wouldn't you say? But listen, you would consider me a pretty methodical person, wouldn't you? Oh, yeah, like a serial killer. Serial killer. I like that. I like that.
 It's a little bit of an exaggeration, but I see your point.
 Yeah. And I like it. I take it as a compliment. Well, listen, sometimes even I can't control everything. So when a new experience presents itself to me I try to stay open to it and just say yes.
 Say yes, huh?
 Yeah. Hey, let me show you something. Let me show you something.
 Look.
 Huh.
 You wearing makeup?
 Well, I'm always wearing a little bit of foundation. But that's not the point. What do you see there? Oh, shit! You got a lesion, dude. No, it's not
 That's not a lesion. It's a hickey. You never seen a hickey? No, I have. Eew! Weird! I thought women our age didn't give hickeys anymore. Oh, no, they don't. Young ladies do though. And I met an extremely young lady the other day, and she gave me this hickey.
 Weird!
 No, she was legal. She was totally legal. I always check their licenses. That's not the point. The point is, how did I meet this young woman? Well, I got caught unexpectedly in a rainstorm one day, so I retreated into a local theater. There I caught a matinee. And during this matinee, I saw this young woman. I introduced myself. We both got caught up in the moment, we said yes to the new experience and that's how I wound up with this wonderful and very sexual hickey.
 Huh.
 You see what I'm saying about adventure, Charlie? Yeah, you always say yes to everything. Well, no, I don't always say yes. That's absurd. I'd be a dead man, wouldn't I, if I said yes to everything.
 Oh, shit, dude. Look at that truck right there.
 Oh, yeah.
 Do you think there's someone in there?
 Well
 What do we say in this scenario, Charlie? We say yes. Hiya. Sorry to wake you up there. Sorry. What do you want? Our car broke down a little ways back. We were hoping maybe you could help us out. I could radio that in and get you a tow truck, but I'm about to hit the road myself.
 You can always hitch a ride with me.
 Oh. Where you headed? Atlantic City. You got any munchies in the car? I'm grumbling. No, Frank, we don't have anything in the car because we were starving ourselves for the casino buffet. It was only supposed to be a 45-minute drive. I gotta eat pretty soon. I'm starting to get woozy. Yeah, I'm starting to get woozy too. I've been starving myself for a few days for Chase. What? I wanted to create that sort of gaunt, angular look with my cheekbones to impress him. You know, give myself a more athletic look. But
 I'm starving. All right, let's jump into the forest and we'll find some food there. Holy shit balls! It's a rabbit! Whoa, whoa! Frank, no! We are not killing any animals, okay? Screw that. I'm hungry. It's wabbit season. Okay, fine. Dee, come with me. I'm gonna find us something to eat. Where are you, wabbit? I'm gonna get you, wabbit. Oh. There you are. What the hell? Wabbit, where'd you go? Shit! How'd you do that? Why are you staring at me? Why are you giving me that look? Whoa. We're having a moment here, aren't we? You boys are, uh, awfully dressed up. Oh. Yeah. Yeah, the tuxes. Sure, yeah, well, we're on our way to Atlantic City for a charity event. You kind of threw me with those outfits. Don't usually find lot lizards out in the wild. You know what? I'm a little behind on my trucker terms. A lot lizard would be a, uh
 A lizard. You know. Truck stop whores. I mean

 Oh!
 Oh!
 No offense. No, man, none taken, because we're not whores.
 No, no, we're not prostitutes.
 Definitely not a lizard. Hey, hey. Shh. Hey. Your secret's safe with me. Don't worry too. I'm not a cop.
 We're not

 I'm not gonna judge you neither. A man's gotta make a living, and looking the way you do I'm not surprised.
 I'm not surprised.
 Oh, I appreciate that. I appreciate that.
 But again, not prostitutes.
 Not lizards though. Save your seduction for someone else. I do not tangle with lizards no more. No. Back in the day, sure, I would've indulged. Hell
 I would've let you turn me into Swiss cheese. I would've let you make me, uh
 make me into a mailbox. Just open the slot and put whatever you want inside.
 Wow.
 We wouldn't do that.
 Not no more. I got a wife now. So I will not suck you, and I will not be sucked on by you. Okay? That's it. That's a 10-4. Yeah, we read you loud and clear. And just to reiterate, we don't suck on people. We own a bar.
 You run a bar? Oh, I'm sure you do.
 Yeah.
 I'm sure you do.
 Yeah. Yeah. How far are we from Atlantic City? Is it a long ride, or
 We're a long way from Atlantic City, a long way.
 Still got a ways, huh?
 Yeah. It's grass, Mac. You're eating grass.
 I see Charlie eating grass all the time, okay?
 Oh, really? Okay, well, Charlie is not an example of good health, so
 Look, Charlie is a survivor. All right? And that's the way we have to think
 eat anything to survive. Eew. What is that? That's a dead crow. Well, I'm definitely not eating that. Wait, wait, whoa. Why not? Because it is a disgusting dead bird, that's why. You eat dead chickens and dead turkeys all the time.
 That's so hypocritical.
 Okay, that's not hypocritical. People eat chickens and turkeys. Nobody eats a crow. It's a trash bird. You know what I do think? I think we're gonna give this crow a proper burial. Well, I'm not gonna do that. But what I will do is use it as bait. Ooh! What if we hide in the bushes and then we wait for something higher on the food chain to come along and grab it and then we grab that and eat it.
 That's a good idea. I'm gonna go to the car

 I'm not doing that. No! I'm gonna go to the car, get a blanket then we can pick up this trash bird with it, and we'll do my plan.
 I'm not helping you.
 That's all right. I'll do it myself.
 I'll eat alone.
 I'm gonna find Frank.
 I'm gonna get him on my team, okay?
 Good. Frank? Hey, Frank, where are you, bro? Oh, there you are. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. Mac, I'm having a thing with this rabbit here. Whoa, dude! He's staring right at you. We've been staring at each other for 10 minutes. I-I- He's not afraid of me. He's looking at me like he knows me. He's looking at me like he can see right through my soul. He probably can, dude. That is the connection between man and beast. Animals can see souls. That is a fact of nature. No! Deandra, what the hell are you doing? It's cool, you guys, I got it. I got it. We can eat.
 We can't eat the rabbit. He's got my soul.
 What are you talking about? They had a moment, Dee. They shared a connection. I know it's cute, you guys, but, come on, this isn't about us anymore. I got to feed the baby. Mac, grab it by the head and wring its neck off. I would rather grab your head and wring your neck for wanting to kill this rabbit, all right? You want to eat it so bad, you kill it. Fine. I will kill it. I'll kill it, and I'll eat it myself.
 I'm gonna kill the shit out of it.
 Don't. Okay. This is us right here. Atlantic City. Great. Yeah, thanks- No. We were hoping to be dropped off at a casino though. This is just a motel. I know. I thought we would slip into a room and you could check my oil. Oh. No. Um, what happened, man?
 I don't know.
 No, I'm sorry. I- No. Shoot, hell, maybe I knew I wanted it when I-I gave you the ride.
 No, no, no, no. You're better- Byron.
 Yeah!
 Remember you changed?
 Byron, you've changed. You don't want this kind of thing anymore.
 No, I do want this kind of thing.
 No, you don't. You would not suck me and you would not, um
 Be sucked by me.
 Be sucked by us!
 I take that back. I don't mean that.
 You can't take that back!
 No take backs!
 I didn't mean any of those things. Look, think about your wife. Remember, you said you love your wife.
 I do, I do, I do. I do, but

 Good. I got cash in my pocket, I got desire in my heart and I'm a-frothin' and a-foamin', and I was thinking
 Hey. Hey. I got an idea. What do you say we slip into a room and you two split me open like a coconut?
 Oh.
 Dennis, what do we say in this situation?
 We say no! We're gonna say no in this situation.
 Why? No! Why? Uh, it's just a

 Oh, my God, dude!
 Look at that! Should've locked my damn door. Should've locked the door. Well, that was definitely an adventure, huh? Yeah, well, sometimes the adventures aren't always good ones. Yeah, but I said yes to the new experience. Right? I'm out of Philly, I'm alive, and I'm not afraid of truckers anymore. Well, if anything, you should be more afraid of truckers now, but I do see your point. Hey, listen, I'm gonna try and get in touch with the guys, okay? Aw, shit. Dude, I left my jacket in the truck. I had everything in that jacket. It had all my money. It had my phone.
 Do you have any money?
 Uh, yeah, it's all right there.
 I put it all on black.
 What?
 No, no, no, no, no!
 Black wins!
 Baby!
 Oh, whew! God!
 But that was lucky.
 Yeah, I know. But you know what, dude? You were right. I said yes to this little adventure, and I won.
 Would you like to bet again, sir?
 Yes, I would.
 No. No.
 Let it ride, please.
 What are you doing?
 Dude, I am gonna say yes to everything! We can't say yes to everything. That is all of our money, dude. No, it's all my money. You lost yours when you said no to the trucker. Did you want to say yes to the trucker? Did you want to go bang the trucker in that motel? I don't know. We say yes to the trucker, we go to the motel room he passes out and dies, we walk away with a free 18-wheeler. Dude, we are gonna lose all of our money.
 Black wins again!
 Oh, baby! Whoo! Yes! Yes, yes! Let it ride, please. Let it ride. Keep it coming. Okay, okay, yeah, let it ride. I want to bash you, bunny. I want to give you one good bash and eat your sweet, delicious meat. You can't kill the rabbit, Deandra. It's got my soul. It's got the man's soul, Dee. Maybe I'll suffocate you. I'll suffocate your rabbit face. Then I'll just suck all the life out of it and then twist your neck and
 Look, can we do this thing, for crying out loud?
 Yes, absolutely.
 This is absolutely ridiculous, holding a funeral for a crow. Yes, that's right, we are. We are honoring its life.
 I want to say a couple words.
 Yes, please. Uh, I've never been good to animals, wearing a leather suit and all. And, uh, also, I kicked a dog in a subway once. It was a real jerk move. I'm really sorry I did it, and I like animals now.
 That was beautiful, Frank.
 Okay, where the hell are Charlie and Dennis?
 I feel like they're not coming back for us.
 They're coming back, okay? Guys, let's just do the right thing. Good night, sweet prince. Oh, God, you- you've gotta be kidding me. Come on. # Ave Maria # Are you kidding me?
 I mean, I never thought I would hold $15,000.
 That's amazing, bro. Listen, I thought I was teaching you today. Let me tell you something, my friend. You were teaching me.
 I know. Look at all this amazing food.
 Oh, I'm starving.
 I mean, they've got stuff I've never even seen before.
 Yeah. What is that? Hi there. You two are with the Reynolds party, yes? Yeah. Yes.
 Is one of you Frank?
 Oh, actually, uh
 Yes. Hi, Mr. Reynolds. I'm Deborah. We spoke on the phone. Yes. Yes! Well, now, I know you'd like to say a few words. Is it all right if we have you up to speak now?
 Uh

 Yes, it is.
 Great. Well, come on.
 Yes! Yes, yes, yes. Mr. Reynolds here is one of our largest new donors. Well, it's donors like him that makes our work for animals possible. Thank you. Thank you. I am Frank Reynolds.
 Yes, yes, yes.
 Yes, yes. "Yes. " That's the word I want to talk about.
 But first, let's talk about animals.
 Yes. If animals have taught me anything it's that you can easily die, and very quickly, under a bus and on the side of the road.
 Yes.
 Okay? So you have to live in the now. Live in the now! I'm gonna live in the now right now. I'm gonna donate another $5,000 to this charity right now. Oh! Oh! That's a
 Oh, you- That's too generous.
 This is for the rats!
 Take it easy. All right. Oh! For the rats, people.
 Yeah, yeah.
 And I'm done.
 Good, good.
 Uh, Mr. Reynolds, there's one more thing. Per your request, we were able to arrange a surprise night for your friend with two true all-stars of our organization
 Chase Utley and Ryan Howard of the Philadelphia Phillies. Oh!
 Hi.
 Mac, right? Uh, yes. I hear you're my number one fan. Yes, I am. Hi. Hi. What's up, brother? All right.
 Oh, my goodness.
 Okay. All right, let's get crazy.
 Let's get crazy.
 Let's get nuts, you guys. # I had a friend was a big baseball player # # Back in high school # # We went back inside, sat down # # Had a few drinks #
 And you got a, uh

 Please don't touch me. # But all he kept talkin ' about was glory days # # Yeah, they'll pass you by Glory days # I'm gonna need some more of that. # In the wink of a young girl's eye # # Glory days #
 I got it.
 Let's get a drink.
 # They'll pass you by #
 No Mets fans!
 Get out of here.
 No Mets fans! What are you thinking, coming in here, man?
 Is it cool?
 It's cool. All right. # Glory days # # Well, all right # # Ooh, yeah #
 # Well, all right #
 # All right # Yeah!
 # Ooh, yeah #
 # Oh, yeah #
 # All right #
 # All right # # All right # Guys, guys, calm down. You're gonna hurt each other.
 Huh?
 No, we're good, man. We're just having fun. I just saw you bite that dude.
 Yeah, it was a

 He took a bite. It was a fair bite. Yeah, he knew I could bite him a little bit. Man, come here and wrestle with us, dude.
 You guys are wasted, man. Let's wrestle.
 Yeah, you're wasted.
 No, we're not.
 You're not wasted? No, no, we're completely sober. But you guys drank a lot though.
 Yeah.
 You guys drank more than anybody I've ever seen.
 Oh, really, dude?
 Whoo!
 Good work, Charlie. Yeah!
 That's what we do. That's kinda what we do, man. We just drink. Well, you know, it's been great, fellas, but we're gonna take off now.
 Oh!
 Really? You guys gonna go? Yeah, you guys try not to hurt anybody tonight, okay?
 No, no, no, we're good, dude.
 Nah, dude, nah. No, we're

 Get off me though, for real.
 Okay.
 You guys take care, okay?
 All right! Whoo! Boy, that was a hell of a night, man. Hell of a night, man.
 Hey, how much money do we have left?
 10,000 bucks. I got an idea how we can spend that shit. Champagne! Champagne! Champagne!
 Champagne!
 Here we go, gentlemen.
 Hey! Thank you, Penelope.
 There it is! Champagne!
 Oh, it's tearing me up inside.
 What?
 What? What's going on, Frank? What are you doing? I ate the crow.
 What- What'd he say?
 What? I ate the crow.
 Why?
 I dug it up last night. I thought it would taste like chicken, but I was wrong.
 Oh, my G

 I think I got to go to a hospital. All right. All right, look. They're clearly not coming back for us, okay? I think we gotta start walking. Goddamn. Oh, man. Seriously, I'm gonna be sad when this is all over. Yeah, well, all good adventures must come to an end at some point. All good things are ending. I shouldn't still be drinking.
 Hey.
 Mm-hmm? I just thought of one last thing that would be awesome. Give me your phone. Oh
 Oh, this is gonna be
 This is gonna be awesome, dude. This is gonna be great. Look at- Yeah! I know, it feels like we're walking a lot here, bunny. But as soon as we get back to the bar you can have as many carrots as your little heart desires. Dee, first you wanted to kill it and now you're bringing it back to the bar? Yeah. I named him Peter Peter Nickel-Eater. 'Cause last night in the car he tried to eat a nickel. It was the cutest thing I've ever seen. I say you bash its brains in right now. I'm done liking animals. This crow is eating me alive! Frank, you are sick because you ate rancid, maggot-filled meat, not because of animals. And, Dee, you've got to set that rabbit free.
 Really?
 Yes! It needs to live in the wild where it can be free and safe in the loving embrace of Mother Nature, okay? Trust me, Peter Nickels-Eater is gonna be much happier. Yeah, all right. You're right. Okay, buddy, I love you, but go back to your family now.
 Go on.
 Okay. See? He's happier already. He's gonna go back to his mother and father, and he's gonna have a wonderful life. Goddamn it.
 Goddamn it!
 Okay, nature is bullshit.
 I'm done with this.
 I told you animals suck. Okay- Wait. Was that a text?
 You getting reception?
 Yes, I guess I'm getting reception. I just got a text.
 Oh, it's from Dennis.
 Oh. I think he sent me a picture. No. No! Oh! You guys! You guys, a car!
 No.
 Hey!
 Hi-yo! Oh-oh-oh, we're saved!
 Hey! Hey! Oh, good. Hey there! Y'all need a ride?
 Yes. Yes.
 Yeah! Must be hot, huh? Oh! Hey, you! Mr. Hottie! Come on now.                    
 Look what Charlie and I found.
 Look at this. Oh, God. Ahh! Get that away from me. It reeks. What is that?
 Dude, this is our mail.
 Look at that.
 It was in the sewer.
 What is our mail doing in the sewer? I threw it in there. You turkeys never open it, so I just started throwing it in the sewer. Why don't you just throw it into the trash? Because if I threw it in the trash, you would find it and then yell at me. Besides, I certainly never expected you guys to be rooting around in the sewer. Uh, yeah. That brings up another issue. What are you two doing in the sewer?
 We always go in the sewer.
 We hang out in the sewer. Why? Why? There's stuff down there.
 Don't knock the sewer till you've tried the sewer.
 You find shit down there.
 But how are you so clean?
 We take our clothes off so we don't get dirty.
 You guys!
 Hang on a second, Dee. We're getting into something. Anything could be down there.
 Big stuff.
 Rings, coins, nudity. That's part of the fun. The two of you are walking around in the sewers naked looking for rings and coins? You feel it with your feet. It's almost like clamming.
 Okay, but, you guys

 Dee, knock it off. I wanna know why these two are rooting around in the sewer
 My water just broke!
 Drain could- What?
 I'm having a baby. Out of my way. I've broken my water. There's a baby inside of me running out of water. Look out! Dennis, that was amazing. I've never seen anybody drive that fast.
 You hit 120! 120!
 I almost stewed my drawers. She was screaming in my ear. Probably screwed my transmission up.
 Nice and easy. Here we go.
 Oh, yes. This is my ride.
 They've done this before.
 Thank you. All done with you. You can go. Where's the guy? Should we call the guy? The guy who
 Oh, no. That guy. There's no guy.
 There's no guy?
 There's no guy. It's complicated. There's gotta be a guy. We'll go get the guy. We'll get the dad. Why don't you guys do what you do best and don't care, okay? I got it from here. We can take it from here. Right, Michael?
 Yeah.
 Michael and I got it. Thanks, guys. All right. Kind of rude but I guess if we're off the hook, let's head back to the bar.
 Yeah.
 Yeah. I could get blitzed. No. Wait. Stop, guys. This is not right. Something is not right here. This is very suspicious.
 What?
 There's no guy in the picture?
 So what?
 There's no dad in the picture. The brunt of the responsibility of this kid is gonna fall on us. We're gonna have to do everything.
 Ooh.
 You're right. Dee is like the most irresponsible person on the planet. Look what she was doing with the mail, for Christ sakes. Oh, my God! We're gonna be in charge of the kid? This kid cannot become our responsibility. Look what this kid has ruined already. He's ruined my transmission.
 Yeah.
 He's ruined a perfectly good sewer conversation.
 I still wanna get to the bottom of that one.
 Right.
 We will.
 God knows what he's gonna ruin in the future. He's going to ruin everything.
 We gotta find the dad! We gotta find that dad.
 You're right.
 Let's find the dad.
 It's the dad's responsibility.
 Let's find the dad.
 Yeah. Okay. I wonder if the dad even knows. I'll bet she's embarrassed
 too embarrassed to tell us because she's bedded some real stinkers.
 She might not even know herself.
 There's always overlap. Any multiple number of sperms could have gone up there and eaten the egg.
 There could be so many dads.
 No, sperm doesn't eat the egg. It doesn't eat the egg and grow strong and become a baby? Either way, she's pregnant and it's a guy, so let's get him. Why don't we just round up the usual suspects and then we'll figure out how many of them

 Somebody's gotta stay here with her.
 You think so?
 You're right. Yeah.
 You're right. Yeah. And it looks like it's gonna be you.
 Why? What happened?
 Well, mostly because we're all on this side.
 You're over there.
 Just 'cause you guys made it to one side before me? You didn't make it to this side on time.
 Also, now we're backing out and you're stuck there.
 I can back out.
 We'll find the dad.
 You better find that dad. This is not fair. Keep your eye on her. What are you doing? What are you doing? Get down! I'm trying to make the TV go. You are standing on top of a rolling chair. You're gonna go flying through that window, for God sakes. Get down.
 I'm serious. You get down, Dee.
 All right, all right.
 Oh, my- What are you thinking?
 I'm trying to watch my stories. I have a very specific birth plan and mostly it involves me watching my stories to relax but I can't get this goddamn TV to do anything. What are you
 Are you- Knock it off.
 I'm mad at the

 Stop straining yourself. Go lie down. Lie down now. This is exactly what I was worried about, Dee. I am going to have to do everything because you're an irresponsible person who stands atop rolling chairs and chooses to go flying through windows. Have the baby first. Have the stupid baby. Then go flying through all the windows you like. Oh, my- Just lie there. Wait for the doctor. I will get your stories. God, this baby is becoming such an irritating thing to me.
 Yeah.
 God, what an irritating thing babies are. Oh, my goodness. I'm having to do everything. I'll figure you out, you son of a bitch. Where is everybody? I thought this was supposed to be a party. They'll be here. You're early. Do you have anything to drink? The salt on the chips dries out my mouth. I'll poke around the fridge and see if there's anything. Where's the beer?
 I forgot the beer. I'm sorry.
 You didn't bring the beer? How are we supposed to know this is a party if there's no beer?
 I got wrapped up in the invitations.
 A party with no beer.
 We don't want them thinking it's an interrogation. Oh! Hey! Party! Party! All right! Hey!
 Hey, Cricket.
 Ooh. Where's the booze at? What's up, fellas?
 Hey.
 Who invited Cricket? I did, because I figured it's a wild card. That's a stone you can leave unturned. We don't have time for that bullshit. Let's just pick one and go. Hey, Bill? Could we talk to you for a sec?
 Maybe, uh, in this

 Oh, yeah? Yeah. Let's do this. A little guy time. Guy time. All right, let's turn it up. Whoo! Let's get weird, buddy. Let's get weird.
 Thanks for coming to the party, Bill.
 Thanks for having me, guys. It's good to get away from the wife and kids for a little bit- let the hair down. So you're still with your wife after all that shit with Dee? Yeah, well, I realized I was a sex addict. I went to therapy. She forgave me for it. Oh, you're a sex addict, huh? That's crazy to be one of those.
 You don't mind if I write some of this down, do you?
 For what?
 Just keeping a log of the party. We like to do that.
 Oh. A funny conversation pops up, you wanna remember it. No problem. Speaking of parties, you guys wanna do a little

 Is that coke?
 Yeah. I picked up a couple grams on the way over.
 Yeah, maybe a little bit later, we can all partake.
 Hey! But for now we're just a bunch of guys hanging out in a room.
 Right on.
 You know, dudes. Let's talk about dude stuff. I like dude stuff. Like what? Oh, I don't know. What do guys talk about? Condoms.
 Right.
 I cannot stand the feel of a condom on my dick.
 I hate condoms. Hate 'em, hate 'em, hate 'em, hate 'em.
 Yeah. The three of us just don't use 'em. How about you? Me neither. I can't stand them. Well, that's interesting. A sex addict who doesn't like condoms. That's why I had a vasectomy, guys. You had a vasectomy? Yep. You just winked when you said that. Did you have a vasectomy or not? No. But that's what I would tell the ladies so I didn't have to wear a condom. Oh!
 Okay. That is incredibly shady.
 No, no, no, no, no, no. What a beautiful underhanded thing.
 Yeah.
 It's disgusting.
 You guys wanna do a bump or what?
 I'll have a bump. I don't understand why there's not a single room in this hospital
 I don't know where

 That has a working television. I want that room now. I don't know where you think I'm gonna get it from. I don't have any. If you do not get my sister her stories and a new room as soon as possible then I will come down on this hospital like the hammer of Thor. The thunder of my vengeance will echo through these corridors like the gust of a thousand winds! You know what? I don't have time for this. I ain't going to jail over you. I will beat your ass and think nothing of it. I'm not doing this with you today. I'm not! I'm not! What's the word on my stories?
 Why are you not in bed?
 I slipped out for a quick sandwich and a soda.
 You left the hospital?
 Yeah. I was kind of hungry. Mostly I was just getting bored. Dee, get in your room. You're drive- I
 It's so boring. There's nothing going on in there. You get in your room. Get in there.
 Don't push me though, because I'm pregnant and I don't Get in the bed.
 Wait a sec. What's this?
 I don't know. Why is there a strange man in my room? They probably slid this man in here thinking that you were never gonna use the room. I don't want there to be a strange man laying in my room who looks dead.
 Is he dead, Dennis?
 I'm sure he's just sleeping. Get in bed.
 I'm gonna scream in his face and see if he wakes up.
 Do not scream in the man's face. I'll jiggle his ankle, and that will determine whether he's alive or not. Excuse me, sir. Are you
 You're very cold. He's very cold.
 Okay. Hey, you! Wake up right now if you're not dead!
 All right, damn it, Dee. Stop. Oh, God. I think he's dead. I think he's dead, Dennis. He's definitely dead. Why would they put a dead old man with paper skin in my room when I'm trying to give birth? Because you weren't using the room, Dee, and the hospital's very full. This was not part of my birth plan. This was not part of my birth plan, sir. Get the nurse and get him out of here. Getting the nurse is not gonna do any good. That woman is stubborn as shit.
 Well, do something 'cause this is upsetting me.
 All right! All right!
 It's upsetting the baby.
 I hate all the responsibility that I have that this baby is causing me. I will get this man out of your room. I will think of something awesome. So things got pretty hot and heavy with you and Dee back in the day, correct?
 That was over a year ago?
 Yeah. She wasn't very nice to me. What are we looking at? No contact with Dee after you dated.
 What's the deal here, bud?
 Well, no, she contacted me for a while usually when she was drunk.
 Drunken late-night booty calls?
 Mm-hmm. No. She usually just yells at me calls me names like army jerk, camo turkey. I know she's just drunk, so it's okay. Not okay. Not okay at all.
 You gotta stand up for yourself, man.
 So you haven't slept with her? Sometimes she tricks me. She tricks you? She tricks you how? To give her sex. She's a very manipulative person. I'm- I'm sorry. Are you guys mad at me?
 No, man, we're not mad

 No.
 I mean- You know.
 Okay.
 Get a grip, but

 Okay.
 There's a room full of dudes out there, so you might wanna Yeah. stop crying before you come back out to the party. Pull it together, because you're a soldier and you should be tougher. Let's go.
 Thanks, guys. This is the guy that's defending our country?
 Well, he's definitely a candidate.
 Oh, boys.
 The keg has arrived.
 Hey, Frank. This power outlet is gonna explode, and you're gonna have to deal with that.
 Duncan, go with it, baby.
 Yeah, let's go for it. Yo, Frank, we gonna set it off, bitch. What are your bridge friends doing here? You gotta give it the illusion of a party. It's gotta be a guy's night, that's why.
 Are you high on blow?
 Whatever Duncan gave me.
 You don't even know what you're high on?
 No. Hey! Yo, Charlie Chuckles, what's crackin', sunshine? Yeah.
 Hey. L'il Kev.
 Hey, L'il Kev. And your beer. Ah. I'll talk to you guys later. Okay. Okay. What is L'il Kev doing here? You gotta throw out a big net to catch the fish that she was banging.
 Oh. Oh!
 Oh!
 Party!
 It's a party, yo. Is that the busboy from the Korean restaurant? Yeah, yeah. She banged him. Are you sure we're not taking this Weekend at Bernie's thing too far?
 I'm worried the sunglasses are ridiculous.
 The sunglasses lighten the mood. Make the whole thing feel like a fun, fun romp.
 Hi.
 Hi, ladies. Hi. Yeah.
 Good afternoon.
 Without the sunglasses Weekend at Bernie's would have been very dark.
 Yeah. Strange movie.
 Strange tale. Hey there, Mr. Craig. Okay.
 The waving thing's awesome, that's true.
 It's pretty sweet, right? What's our plan here? Are we just gonna throw him in the trash or find a laundry chute
 Fire him down that?
 What? No. I'm gonna drop him in one of these rooms if I can find an empty one. But that way, somebody could find him and put him back in my room. That's a good point. Maybe we can stuff him in a drawer or jam him in a closet.
 That'll buy us some time, right?
 Mm-mmm. Makes me feel like I have to touch him. I don't wanna touch him at all. Why don't we just put him in the trash? Please don't put me in the trash.
 Oh!
 Oh, are you alive?
 Oh, my goodness.
 Whoa. What is going on here? What are you doing with Mr. Craig? They're trying to put me in the trash.
 Don't- No.
 You know what? I refuse to share a room with an old man who likes to pretend to be dead.
 He's a liar.
 You are not allowed to move the patients.
 Ooh!
 What? What?
 Oh, Dennis. Oh, my God.
 What?
 I think I'm having this baby.
 Doctor! Oh! It doesn't feel good. This sucks. This sucks a bag of dicks.
 Oh, I'm sure.
 Oh, man! Oh!
 Help my sister.
 Wait, wait, wait. Don't leave me.
 I don't like it.
 No, I'm coming.
 We got you from here. We got you.
 I'm coming with you. You ain't going nowhere. Get your narrow ass back in that waiting room before I knock you in there. You have done enough today. Crazy-ass white boy steadily dressing up folk and talking about Thor. I bet I earned this. I got you. Wow. This whole thing's really setting in now. Yeah, it's really sinking in, man. We're gonna have a baby. This is really cool. Please don't throw me in the trash. No one's putting you in the trash. Stop saying that. Will you stop? # Everybody's talking all this stuff about me #
 Man, I used to have some jean shorts like that too. I slept in them shits, man. Eventually, I blew the crotch out of them things. But you can't wear 'em every day and expect for 'em to hold up. That was some nice-ass denim too. I miss them shorts. But you gotta take 'em off every now and then. You gotta take 'em off, son. Why are you having sex with her? Well, she gets drunk and calls me a cardio-jerk or a workout turkey. And after a while, I just kind of cave in. Wow. You just
 I gotta try that with someone.
 Thanks, Rex.
 Thank you.
 Enjoy the party.
 Thanks, Rex. She's just berating these guys into having sex with her. Yeah, and she is slammin' ass all over town. She's getting way more action than us. She's stuck on her curse words. "Jerk" and "turkey" are all that she's using. Well, clearly they're working for her, 'cause Rex is a quality lay. Yeah, Re
 Well, he's not fit to be a father though. A father? None of these guys are fit to be fathers. They're animals. Even if we do figure out who it is how are we gonna trust this baby with one of these monkeys? They're animals. They got no self-control. It takes discipline to raise a kid, you know?
 You gotta set rules. You gotta set ground rules.
 Set some boundaries. Like don't have 'em doing cocaine.
 Get them off the Internet.
 The Internet's a very, very dangerous place. Kids spend all their time on the Internet. "Hi. Who are you? There's your penis and there's your butt."
 You gotta learn from some books.
 You don't want 'em reading too many books.
 You don't want 'em to be a nerd.
 You don't want 'em to be a nerd.
 I'm not raising a nerd, bro.
 If it's a nerd, I'm gonna bash his head in.
 Nerds get nowhere in life.
 Oh, my God. Is he a nerd? I could bash some nerds right now. Right after this we should probably bash nerds. I gotta get it out of my system. Bash some nerds.
 Absolutely.
 Get bowed up.
 You gotta teach him how to beat nerds up.
 He's gotta be beating nerds up. These are good ideas for raising a kid. We have a lot of ideas about raising a kid. We are men who can be great dads. We have great opinions. And that's all that parenting is
 pretending you know what you're talking about and then jamming it down a kid's throat. Oh, my God. That's what we're gonna do. When I see that baby, dude, we're gonna run towards it.
 I'm gonna grab it. I'm gonna pick him up.
 And jam shit down his throat!
 Dude.
 Dude, we're gonna be the dad.
 We're so much better dads than these guys.
 Yeah, look at this. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Oh! I can't wait to tell him. This is so exciting. There he is. Hey, Dennis, Dennis. We have news. We have wonderful news. Charlie and I have decided that we are going to be the father of this child. Dude, we did a complete 180. You guys, I did a 180 too. I totally did. I was all pissy this morning about having to be at the hospital. Then I realized I've been firing on all cylinders because of this baby thing. Dude, I did this Weekend at Bernie's operation earlier that would have blown you guys' minds
 it was very effective. Then I busted out this sweet Thor line on this lady because she was pissing me off. It was, like, boom! I really hit her with it. And I never reference the Nordic gods.
 I don't understand what your point is.
 What are you talking about? I'm saying I wanna be the dad too. I'm totally into it.
 Okay.
 That steps on our thing a little bit, but

 'Cause we were doing the Maybe instead of doing a My Two Dads type thing we could fold in another dad and do a Three Men and a Baby type situation.
 That's what it is. I like that.
 An equally effective movie.
 A great movie.
 Did we miss it? Did we miss it? No. It was
 What's going on? Who are all these people? I couldn't decide who the dad was, so I brought everybody. You didn't try and decide who the dad was. You just got high. Well, the interrogation did turn into a coke party. But they all promised to have blood tests. If this kid is mine, I'm gonna blow my brains out. Oh, he got zooted, man. He took an eight-ball to the dome. No, no, Frank. Dude, get these guys out of here, all right?
 We're gonna be the father of the baby now.
 We're gonna be the fathers.
 It has been decided, so sayeth Thor.
 Thor said it.
 The who?
 Thor.
 Who Thor?
 Is that your Greek God reference?
 He's a Nordic God.
 Nordic God. I said something else earlier that sounded a lot cooler than that. That one didn't really work. Guys, here she comes. She's coming. How do we make it a big moment? I wanna make it a big moment. With music. Duncan, play something special.
 Frank, I got the perfect thing.
 Okay, great.
 Why do they have the

 I don't know. # Pray God you can cope # # I'll stand outside # # This woman's work # # This woman's world # # Ooh, it's hard on the man # # Now his part is over # # Now starts the craft # # Of the father # # I know you have a little life in you yet # # I know you have a lot # Carmen? What are you doing here?
 I'm here to get my baby.
 What? Oh, yeah. The tranny's the dad. Yeah!
 You had sex with the tranny?
 No. I was their surrogate. We used her sperm and a donor egg and then they just kind of
 right up there and
 We had a difficult time finding a surrogate, but Dee was a miracle to us. I can't have kids of my own, and Carmen always wanted a baby. Yeah, yeah. Great, great. Miracle for you. How wonderful. Dee, you tricked us?
 How did I trick you?
 We were getting all pumped up about being this baby's dad. We were all keyed up for nothing. If we knew you were doing this stupid surrogate thing again we would have just completely ignored your pregnancy. You did ignore my pregnancy. This has been a huge disappointment for us.
 Why?
 We were gonna be great dads. We were gonna impose our will on the kid. We had a Three Men and a Baby thing going on.
 Okay, I'm sorry.
 I have to admit this whole thing might be for the best. Those two are gonna make great parents, much better parents than any of us would.
 Don't you think?
 Yeah. I guess.
 A baby would've screwed up our chemistry.
 It might've. Yeah. We got a good thing going. Why blow it with a baby? That being said, don't get knocked up anymore, Dee. It's getting old. Oh, yeah. I didn't enjoy any of it. So, what I'm confused on is the mother is the father and the father is black
 And the baby's not black, so

 It's all been explained.
 Yeah.
 I'll talk you through it later. Then what is your deal? Do we pop you back in there? Are you done having babies? What's going on? Can you take me to go get a beer? I need a beer. I could go for a beer. You guys wanna go back to the bar?
 Yeah!
 Hey, you guys. Let's bring the party back to the bar. Bring the music. Let's go.
 What the hell's happening back there?
 A few buddies came along.
 Don't worry about it, Dee.
 Oh! Let's party in the sewer.
 Oh, yeah, Charlie.
 I'm not going into a sewer. What is your obsession with the sewer these days?
 You find great stuff down there.
 Like what?
 Like sewage.
 Ha-ha! Good one, Dee. She's back, baby. She's back. Supposing it's storming and a guy loses his ring
 Is this the ring story again?
 And it goes into the gutter? You gotta come up with something else, Frank. You can't keep using the same
 Like, give me some crack. You know what I'm sayin', dawg? We'll get more.                    
 How is this? Is it okay?
 # Jingle bells chime # Uh, no you have to move it a little to left
 # Jingle bells chime #
 Alright, here we go.
 What's up?
 No, on the other left. On my other left? I only have one left. It's just an expression. Just move to the other direction.  No, no, just move it to the other way.
 Move to the other way.
 Towards your left. Your left and my left are the same, 'cause we're facing the same direction. We're two different people. We can't have the same left. Doesn't make sense. DENNIS: Here we go again.
 Hey-oh!
 Yo! (music stops) Well, aw all right, hey, go in the back, we got some more Christmas lights.
 We need some help.
 SWEET DEE: No, we're not helping you. Come on! It's almost Christmas. Get into the spirit. Let's put some decorations up. Whoa.
 What in the hell is that?
 Yeah, you like that? That's an industrial-size snowblower we got from some dude on the Internet from the Poconos. Yeah, you know how it never snows on Christmas? We got a backup plan this year. We're going to have a white Christmas out in front of the bar. We're gonna make the snow ourselves. If you guys love Christmas so much, why do you always wait until the last possible minute to put up the Christmas decorations? It is the day before Christmas. That's our tradition. Yeah, that's what we do. We drink a lot of eggnog. We pass out, and then, you know, we don't put anything up, so we do it all last-minute. Yeah, then we wake up Christmas morning and throw rocks at trains. Why would grown men throw rocks at trains? Why wouldn't we throw rocks at trains? It's Yeah, it's awesome. It's what you do on Christmas morning.
 We've been doing it since we were kids.
 Look, whatever. I'm sorry that we love Christmas, and we have awesome traditions, and you guys hate Christmas. Well, they hate Christmas because I always got the best gifts and Frank always gave them shitty presents. Oh! You think we don't like Christmas because Frank got us shitty presents? Is that really what you think? No, Frank didn't buy shitty presents. Frank bought the most awesome presents in the entire world. As a matter of fact, he would find out whatever Christmas presents we wanted that year, and he would buy them for himself instead of buying them for us. Yeah.
 Really?
 Yeah. That must have been why he wanted me to walkie you guys when you got to the bar. 'Cause he was trying to do something about making your Christmas better Yo, Frank, the Eagle's landed. They're here, so, uh over and out. Go ahead.
 FRANK (over radio): Tell them to go outside.
 No. Frank, whatever Christmas presents you bought for yourself, you can bring them in the bar and ruin them in front of us in here. No can do. It's too big. And, Dennis, you're really going to want to see this. It's your dream gift. My dream gift? What is he? Nah, oh oh No, God, no. (tires squealing) (Frank grunting) Goddamn it! (chuckles) Merry Christmas, bitches. Deandra look at this. A nice Sergio Giorgini bag.
 You wanty?
 I don't want it. Fake-out! It's mine. (cackling) And I use it to keep in my Cheesy Loops and chocolate-covered malted milk balls. What is your problem, Frank? Why do you do this to us every year? I do it to you every year, Deandra, because you and your brother never learned the lesson that I try to impart at Christmastime. Oh, my God. And that is, you have to earn what you get. This principle made me a multimillionaire. No, no, stealing millions of dollars from your ex-business partner is what made you a millionaire, Frankra Eugene Hamilton was a great man. Do not speak ill of the dead. She's speaking ill of you. Oh, whatever. I'm gonna burn up the rubber with my Lamborghini. (imitating engine revving) Oh, I got my nice Sergio Giorgini bag. Damn son of a bitch! How can he do this to me?! He's gone too far this year. Okay, he's not even our dad anymore, and he's still doing this. I can't take it anymore. Who puts cheesy snacks and chocolate in a designed bag. Oh dear, *** Okay, well *** begin to compare a $250,000 Italian sports car to a handbag, but I get your point. This has got to stop. However, the good news is, I think there's a big opportunity in this. What kind of opportunity? Well, Frank seems to think that his old business partner's dead.
 He's not dead?
 Nope. And that gives me a very interesting idea. EUGENE: So, you want to talk to me about Frank Reynolds? Yes, we do. See, Mr. Hamilton, we heard about how Frank dicked you all up and down, and we thought we'd give you a chance to get some payback. Mm-hmm. We thought you might want to help us because, you see, Frank thinks you're dead. Well I have forgiven Frank.
 What?
 Frank? You see some years ago, I had a near-death experience, and I I saw the light and I saw the truth of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Oh. Uh-oh. So I have forgiven everyone who ever did me any harm. Okay, well, uh, that's cool because you could probably still help us. Frank has not found the Lord yet. No Frank's got nowhere near the Lord. Yeah, and so, in the spirit of the Lord and Christmas and And God. uh, all that, we want to do a Christmas Carol type thing, where we show him the error of his ways through his past, his present, and his future. See, Mr. Hamilton, we feel like if Frank can just understand what a dick he's been to people in his past, and how he's just going to probably end up old and alone like yourself, then maybe he'll be able to make up for some of his past mistakes. When can I talk to Frank about his salvation? At the end.
 You can do it at the very, very end.
 The very end.
 The very, very end
 Yeah. Yeah. But in the meantime, we need you to be our ghost. Just being in your childhood room is giving me the Christmas spirit, bro. Yeah, dude. It's awesome, huh? It's pretty cool that your mom kept all your stuff, man. Yeah, dude. I'm telling you I think I've got an Omnibot around here somewhere.
 You remember Omnibots?
 Totally. Those were amazing.
 Oh, my God, so cool.
 Oh, check this out, dude.
 Look at that: karate trophy.
 Why do you have a karate trophy?
 I found that in the street.
 Oh, that makes sense, okay. And, oh! Captain Caveman. Oh! Hey remember when we ***
 ***
 Absolutely! And then we would bash away at 'em, and we'd bash the dogs to pieces. Yeah, boom! Remember that?
 (gasps) Simon?!
 Simon. Dude, this game was my favorite. Do you remember how challenging this was? Yeah, but, Charlie, don't get lost in that, okay? Just
 (game beeps)
 I got the first one, bro. (two electronic tones) Uh-oh. Ooh, ooh. It just threw me a curveball here did you catch that?
 Uh, it went "bee-boop."
 I know, but I don't know what order.
 Which one was "bee"?
 Which one lit up? The yellow and blue both lit up.
 Well, then press yellow and blue.
 I don't remember which order it happened. (plays tones correctly)
 Oh, okay, you got it.
 Yeah.
 You got lucky, though.
 (three electronic tones) Okay, now three happened, and I have no idea which three. Hey-oh! Boop ba-ba, beep-beep, ba-ba-ba!  Omnibot, the breaking robot from the  Dude, we're going to put a Santa hat on him. He's going to serve us drinks and break-dance.
 That is awesome, dude.
 Yeah, it's awesome.
 What was he holding here?
 (Mac imitates robot beeping) Is this his, like, instructional video? "Christmas Day 1985." Oh, shit! This is a home movie
 my dad made of Christmas.
 Really? Oh, yeah, every Christmas morning he would videotape me opening up my presents.
 Toss that shit in, man.
 Yeah, man. Look, son, a video camera, hmm? (laughs) Oh, this is something. Can I open mine now? No, no, keep your voice down. Let your mother open hers first, okay? Here we go. Here we go. "Mom." Let's go, Ma. Can't wait. Hon, wow! Cashmere! Beautiful!
 That's gonna look good on you, baby.
 Oh, yeah!
 Now can I go?
 Uh, not yet, son. Let's see what Daddy got, hmm? Let's see what it is. Would you look at this. A brand-new stereo. Oh, look at that. That's gonna be perfect for the living room.
 Yeah!
 Goddamn it! Can I goddamn go?! This is taking forever! Okay, fine, fine, fine, fine. You go. You go, yeah. Okay. It's your turn.
 Let's see what you got.
 Let's see. (Charlie screaming) A Cabbage Patch Dep. (Charlie screaming) You don't have to yell like that, okay? Who's down there? What?
 Oh, my God!
 Who's down there?! Time to go, time to go. All right, move. Son, get your there we go. Open the door. Get the stereo, get the stereo. Honey, get the stereo. That was awesome.
 My dad looks really young, doesn't he?
 Dude, what was what was that? What happened right there? Huh? What was the family on the stairs? What was that? That was probably the next family coming in to get their presents. What are you What are you talking about? What was happening there? That was the Christmas tradition. Where you go from house to house collecting your presents and then, when the next family comes, you would run. I'm not aware of this tradition, Mac. In fact, I think that you were just stealing from that home. Oh, no. I was taking their presents, but they were taking mine. Yeah, dude. That's why there were never any presents at my house when I got back: the neighbors took them. Its a South Philly tradition, Charlie. No, mm-mm, that makes no People don't do that, dude. That doesn't make any sense. You're telling me that Christmas morning, you would not go to your neighbor's house and take their presents? No! No one does that. Well, my dad told me that that was the tradition. And your dad is like a thief and a murderer who eats people, so he's not really trustworthy. This is really dicking with my Christmas spirit. Okay, whoa, bro. I tell you what: I got a plan. Let's go to my house, you know. You'll see how my mom does it. We'll get you right back in the Christmas mood.
 All right?
 All right? Okay, all right. Okay. You think you think these chains are really necessary? Yeah, they're necessary. It's part of the whole thing. Yeah, it's part of the look. Okay, now this is how it's gonna work. I'm going to pump this smoke under the door. Then you blast in there and give Frank a good scare. Yeah, and remember, he's really gonna believe you're a ghost, so he's going to listen to anything you say. Definitely, definitely. You sit him down, you make him watch the videotape. And that's what's going to prove how horrible he's been to us all these years.
 Yeah.
 When you're doing the ghost thing, you really got to sell it (moans eerily)
 you know what I mean?
 Make it sound real, like a ghost would.
 Yeah, do it up; do it up.
 Okay. (echoing): Frank! (gas hissing) (echoing): Frank! (Frank snoring) (echoing): Frank! Put some vio brato into it. Fr-a-a-nk! Frank! Fire! Fire! Fire! We're gonna die! We're all gonna die! We're gonna suffocate! (gagging) Gotta get outta here! Gotta get out! We're gonna die! Calm down, Frank. Calm down. There's no fire. Eugene? Yes.
 A ghost! Ghost! Ghost!
 No, no! Ghost! Ghost! Get out! Get out! No, Frank, stop, stop! Deandra! Deandra! Stop it, Frank!
 You're supposed to listen to the guy.
 No, he's dead! Calm down, Frank! Go sit on the couch and keep your mouth shut, okay? Just sit and listen! Thank you. Now, yes, you're right. Your old business partner is not dead. But Mr. Hamilton, do you have something that you'd like to say to Frank? I do. Are you familiar with the forgiving nature of our Lord and *** No, no, no Eugene, at the end, okay? For the love of God, at the end, okay?
 This is the beginning.
 Okay, but if you're gonna bring God into it, could you do, like, the Old Testament and the Covenant and keeping your eyes closed or your face will melt and the coins and the fear and the Indiana Jones? You know what? Sit-Sit
 Just sit on the couch.
 Okay.
 We'll take it from here, okay?
 Thank you. Thank you. Good job, buddy; good job. Okay, um, bust out the video.
 The tape now, right?
 Let's do the video. What the hell is this? Welcome to your Christmas past, Frank. Is this gonna take long? Because it's cutting into my Countach time. I was gonna go out and make some modifications to the car.
 Modifications on the?
 Yeah. No, no, no, you do not make modifications on a Countach. That car is "pehr-fect." Yeah, but I can't reach the door when it goes up, and I was gonna put a wire rig and then drop the bag. You are gonna ruin that car, Frank! You're gonna ruin it! Okay, okay, we're gonna take you on a journey, like the Christmas Carol, and you're gonna be a better person, and your life will be enriched and fulfilled, and just watch the TV. Hmm. (on video): Okay, Dennis, Deandra, come and get your presents.
 We have presents!
 Oh, yes! Yes! Presents! Presents! Presents!
 Christmas, 1986.
 Mm-hmm. This is where you destroyed Christmas for us forever. Oh, no, no, open the biggest one first. That's the one. Look at that, yeah! That's for both of you. Tear it apart. Go on. What's in there? ("Hark! The Herald Angels Sing" plays) There's nothing in there. Fake-out! There's nothing in any of 'em! Now go wake up your pillhead mother. Awww! Aw, this is bringing back such great memories! The fake-out was the best, right? Right, Eugene? No! No! Eugene, will you please tell him what a terrible person he's been for always doing this to us, please? What are you talking about? Eugene was the guy who taught me the fake-out. He's right. But I have changed, my good friend.
 Yeah, see, he's changed.
 Yeah, that's the point. That's the point. He changed, and so, now it's time for you to change.
 Yeah!
 They're right. Are you ready to find the loving arms of God?
 God!
 Where is your anger? This is time to get your vengeance, guy!
 Let's all go to church!
 No!
 No?!
 Church? All right, let's move on to Christmas present.
 Yeah, this
 Let's just continue the journey. All right, grab your jacket.
 Eugene?
 All right.
 Up, up, up, up, up. Come on.
 Let's go. Come on, Eugene, let's go. Yeah, man. See, this is Christmas, right? Yeah, your mom's really into this, huh? She loves it. Hey, Ma! Hey, Ma! Hey!
 Oh! Hey! Merry Christmas!
 I'm so excited! It's almost Christmas! I'm so excited!
 Merry Christmas!
 Merry Christmas! Ooh, you brought the vodka!  Glug, glug, glug, glug!   Christmastime, Christmastime!   Drinking on Christmas!  Thank you! Well, listen, you guys, you make yourselves at home. I'll be in the kitchen making gingerbread men for my gingerbread boys.
 Yeah, gingerbread men!
 All right, man, I'm feeling I'm back!
 This is Christmas, man!
 Mac is back! You got good tunes, good food on the way. My mom and I would be excited about the Santas coming over.
 Yeah.
 This is Christmas, bro! Yeah, the, the what? The Santas that come over on Christmas morning to cheer my mom up. The Santas? Plural?
 What the hell are you talking about?
 Yeah. Oh, dude, this was like the best tradition ever, man. Every Christmas morning (doorbell rings) I would run to the door and I'd open it, and I'd find the first Santa Claus. Now, the Santa Claus would come in and he'd give me a present, you know, or something, and then he'd go in the room with my mom and cheer her up for a while. (blows kiss) (doorbell rings) Then the doorbell would ring, and the next Santa Claus would come and he'd give me a present or something or other, and he'd go cheer my mom up for a while. (doorbell ringing)  He knows when you're awake   He knows if you've been bad or good  (gasps)  So be good, for goodness' sake  I didn't always understand the presents but I always found a way to have fun with them.  Santa Claus is coming to town  Wait, dude, one year, Santa even brought one of his elves. It's like a goddamn *** Or I think he was an elf. You know, the memory was blurried for some reasons. Merry Christmas. Charlie, I I hate to *** you man, but based on the story that you have just told me, I think your mother was a prostitute.
 What?
 Yeah. Come on, man! I'm just saying based on that story that you just told me, I'm fairly certain that those Santas were running a train on your mom for money. No, dude, they would just give my mom money, and go (bells tolling) Yeah. Chew on that for a second.
 Let that settle in.
 No, no. Yes.
 No, no.
 Yes. Yes.
 No!
 Yes.
 No!
 Okay, just relax.
 No!
 Are you okay?
 No.
 Jesus Christ, let's get you out of here.
 No!
 Let's get you out of here.
 Merry Christmas, Mrs. Kelly.
 No! No! Just relax, dude. Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. Okay, here we go. Come on in, guys. Why Why would you take me to my old real estate office? Well, because Frank, tonight's the annual Christmas party and we want to show you how much our ex-employees despise you. 
 why is it a Christmas present to me?
 It's not a Christmas present, Frank. This is the Christmas present. All right, Frank, here's the plan: We're gonna hide you somewhere in the office, so you can hear people talking shit about you, all right? Oh, that's cool. Oh, I see where you're going with this now. Sew me into the couch. Sew you into the couch? What are you saying? Yeah, that's what I do at home all the time. Hide in the couch. It's a great hiding place. I catch Charlie pounding off all the time. Pounding off? Where do you get these terms, Frank? Why do you want to catch Charlie masturbating? No, I don't care! No, let's just hide you in a closet or under a desk or something. Look, you want to do this Christmas Carol bullshit, you do it my way. Okay, fine, we'll sew you into a couch, Frank. Okay, right, you just rip off the back, take out the stuffing, put me inside and sew it up.  It's the most wonderful time of the year Excuse me, folks. Hey, happy holidays, huh? Here we go.
 How we doing over here?
 Uh, not well. This is ridiculous. People are definitely starting to notice. Of course they're starting to notice. There's a grown man crammed inside of a couch, for Christ's sakes. They're gonna notice. Let's just talk to some people. How about how about them right there?
 This guy?
 Can you grab that guy?
 Hey, you two.
 Hey! Hey, you two! So how we doing at the Christmas party?
 We having a good time?
 Yes, great.
 Great, great.
 Good, good. So, u Sh, Frank Reynolds (blows raspberry) Oh, yeah, we were just talking about him.
 He's the worst, huh?
 Right? Do, do you work here?
 Yeah, of course, yeah.
 Yeah, yeah.
 Well, we pop around.
 Yeah, we pop around here.
 We're consultationists
 For this. So we consult here. We consult across the street, too.
 Across the whole street.
 Is there a man in that couch? (Dennis chuckles) What are you saying? A man in a couch?
 Hello?
 That's absurd! I believe there's a man in that couch right there. There is no man! There's no man. Say some things about Frank Reynolds. Say 'em loud, and make sure that they're horrible, horrible things, and then we'll deal with the man in the couch. So there is a man in the couch. All right, just call Frank Reynolds an asshole. Who is Frank Reynolds? He's the man in the couch! Oh, my God, what are you people doing?! Will you just say something about Frank that's horrible?! Call him an asshole! Frank Reynolds is an asshole!
 There you go!
 Thank you! Oh, great! Now you've (gasping) (people screaming) Oh, Jesus Christ! Oh, no! Oh, no! What is happening! Aah! Can't breathe!
 Too hot!
 ***
 Too hot in the couch.
 Okay, she called you an asshole.
 She called you an asshole, Frank!
 No air! No air! Air! Air!
 Oh! Geez!
 (people groaning) Synch by Benfo.                      Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been one week since my last confession. Okay, my son. In the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, what is your confession? I'm fat. Oh, great and angry God, I command thee to smite my friends! Now, calm down, son. Calm down. Let's try and remain composed. Okay, Father. I'll try, but I can't promise anything 'cause I'm pretty excitable. Also, I'm super pissed because my friends made me fat. How did your friends make you fat? Were they force-feeding you? Well, no, not exactly. This whole thing started because we became incredibly successful, and then they became monsters, which in turn made them make me fat. So, really, I'd like to confess on them, because they're sinners and pricks. Son, I don't think you understand the purpose of confession. Right. All right. Sorry, Father. You need the context. Let me start at the beginning. Now, my friends and I own and operate a bar in South Philly. And a few weeks ago, we became more successful than we ever have before. It was insane. Oh, oh, oh! Look who's back! I scored a shitload of fireworks. Out of my way, Frank. Oh. Hey. Whoa. North Carolina-- what a hell of a state. Not now, Frank. We're packed. What the shit is going on around here? I really don't get it. I don't see how we're so popular now. I just can't wrap my head around this. Were we doing anything different? Guys, we may have tipped. Uh-oh. No, this is a good thing. This is what happens with success in business. Hmm? Okay, if you keep making the right decisions over time, eventually you will get to a point where you tip, and you become successful. It's like that book The Tipping Point. I totally buy that. I totally-- like, check out this decision. I keep a very clean bar every day, very tidy. I think people respond to that. They say, "What was that clean bar I was at the other week?" And then they show up again. And then someone says, "Hey, did you see that clean bar? Let's go there." Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. And my comedy, you know. Like, all my, all my funny jokes and stuff that I throw out. You know, I'm like the cute, funny waitress who has all these one-liners and hilarious jabs I throw at the customers, and I add all that charm to the place. That's-That's probably doing it. Yeah, good-looking guy like myself, takes pride in his personal appearance, takes pride in his personal hygiene, has great hair. You know, you put a guy like that behind the bar, and people will eventually flock to this man. That-That's what you're saying, yeah. That's what you're saying. Sort of. I didn't think it was No, the point is that we got to keep doing what it is that we do. Yes. No matter how psychotically vain Right. or needy and pathetic or, I mean, just plain sad. Well, let's not put labels on it, 'cause we don't know which one is the one that is the most If we keep doing all of it Mm-hmm. then we'll keep tipping up. Yes. Nice. In order to maintain this success, I do think though we need to get some rest. Let's do the right thing here for once in our lives, and let's go home and get a good night's sleep. But that sleep would never come, Father, because success was about to change everything. Hey, Charlie, you asleep? Charlie, are you asleep? No. No. I had a great idea. I don't want to hear it. Frank, I'm a successful man now, okay? I need to maintain a certain level of excellence, so I can't have you, like, telling me terrible ideas all night, 'cause that brings me off my excellence, okay? Okay, but this is a great idea. I don't want to We take, we take the M-80s that I have, and we stic'em in some lamb and pa-cha, we blow it up! What are you looking to do? Like, flash-cook a-a gyro sandwich? Yeah. That's a good idea. Flash-cook a sandwich. Oh, my God Cook the meat immediately. I mean, what you're talking about is just a meat bomb, and that's a waste of a good lamb. So if you're done with coming up with terrible ideas, um, I'm going to go back to bed. A meat bomb! You-You blow it up. I mean, like, just take the thing and stick it I'm going to the crevice! No, no, no, no! Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, don't go in the crevice. Charlie, don't go in the crevice. I'm going in the crevice. Come on, don't go in the crevice. Oh, come on, man. Oh, my God! Yello. Hey-o. It's Mac. What's up? Hey-o! 'Sup?! Yeah, I'm going to go out and rage. Is Charlie there? Hey, it's Mac. He wants to go rage. I don't care. I'm in the crevice. He's in the crevice. Shit, he's in the crevice? I'll come out with you. We'll go out. You and me, we'll go together. We'll have a ball. Hello? I-I'm not seeing how this relates to your weight gain. Uh, I'm telling a story, Father. Frank's not a guy that usually comes up with plans. I mean, you want to know all the key players and how success affected them, right? Well, I think your time could be better spent if you focus more on yourself. But I haven't done very much wrong. Okay, you know what, Father? I'm just going to plow ahead, because I'm sensing some resistance. And Dennis always tells me, never let someone's resistance stop you from getting what you want. So, the bar's success continued. But Dee's inflated ego about her comedy was keeping her from doing her job. Kids these days, they have so many more choices than we had when we were little. Am I right? Excuse me? Excuse me? I mean, it's like, do you want to watch Kung Fu Panda on Blu-ray Excuse me? Oh, my God. Yeah? We are still waiting on those beers. Yeah, I know. Right in the middle of the joke. And now where was I with it? Can, um, we get those margaritas that we ordered a while ago, as well? That'd be great. Yeah. Can I finish the joke? 'Cause the funny part comes at the end, so you're going to miss it if you don't Right. No, you-you keep trying to tell jokes and Well, you keep interrupting me, and that's why I'm not Well, they're not really landing is what I'm trying to Oh, they're not landing because I'm not getting to the punch line, so if you could just be patient and let me get it out. Kids these days have so many more choices No, don't, don't try to finish the joke. Don't try to finish the joke. I'm not even going to listen. Oh, I just want my margarita, I just want my margarita, I just want my margarita. You know what, you're not getting your margarita. Thanks. Why do we have this? What is this? Dude, where the hell have you been? Uh, slept in. You slept in? It's, like, almost the middle of the night, man. Why were you sleeping in? Oh, God. Well, because I drank three bottles of champagne and hung out with a stray dog all night under a bridge, okay? It was sweet. Can I please get, like, 20 margaritas so this bitch will listen to my kid joke? Okay, first of all, your jokes never land, all right? So please don't concentrate on your comedy anymore, 'cause it's terrible, all right? I'm sorry, I said it. Look, can we just do what we normally do? I shouldn't even be bartending, all right? I'm in over my head, I'm yelling at customers 'cause I'm getting a little agitated here. Can Dennis please come here and do this? Where is Dennis? Dennis is in the bathroom, and he's been there for, like, an hour. Okay, company meeting in the bathroom, okay, guys? Company meeting. Let's go. Dennis? Where are you, bud? Company meeting. Uh, I'm in here. All right, good, man. Hop on out. Company meeting. I don't want to. You have to. It's a company meeting. You have to No. What's going on in there? I'm bashing it. Huh? I'm bashing it. Oh, no. Don't bash. Don't bash. I'll come out. I'll come out. Oh. Uh, I saw a couple gray hairs, and I was, like, "I'll eradicate those," and then With black paint? Well, just-just go easy on me, all right? Don't make fun of me or anything. I feel very sensitive right now. It's hard to maintain all this. You look like Superman. Oh, cool. Yeah, right on. Well, he was the original, right, so? The original what? S-Superhero. He was, like Ugh. Is that what you're going for? No. Dude, come on. It would be that obvious, like, if you didn't know me. You'd be, like, "Oh, shit. Maybe that's Superman." No, you wouldn't. Everyone knows who Superman is, and they know it's not you. Shit. Right. Guys, come on. Clearly, success is starting to get to all of us. We can't be Superman. Yeah, yeah. Uh, yeah. No shit. I'm running around like an animal out there. I mean, all I'm doing is serving drinks. You're supposed to serve drinks; You're a waitress. People need their drinks, and we need a waitress to serve those drinks. Guys, don't change now. All right? We have a certain chemistry that got us here to begin with. All right? We don't need to start Oh, that's terrible. Let's just get back out there and step it up a little bit, please. Let's just get back to work, man, and do what we do, okay? You're not good. "Back to work. Back to work, everybody. I'm Charlie, and I'm in charge all of a sudden." Are you eating in there? Uh, yeah, I got some donuts and some M&Ms and some, uh, chips. I could pass them through if you want some. You aren't allowed to eat in here. I'm sorry, Father. I-I have enough. If you want a donut, I could give you one. You better put that away and come back when you're finished. Okay. I I'm done done. Uh, so Charlie was up all night working, and Frank was still coming up with plans, and they were not good. Oh, shit. Oh, my God. It's morning already, huh? Ow! Hey, that's good. You want to do that to people? What is that? What are you doing? It's a plan. We'll do it to people. We'll go around Look at that. Look at the look on your face. That's so good. Frank, I don't even think you know what a plan is, dude. All right, I got something else I've been working on all night. Come on, come with me. Lock up, let's go, come with me. Don't hit me with the stick again. Oh, my God. Okay, Charlie? All right, look at this now. I put two extra stop signs. Yeah. Now there's four stop signs. All right So no cars can go. Frank, you've just created a four-way intersection. If anything, you've made this intersection safer. No shit. Oh. Look, dude, I don't have time for these shenanigans, all right? I need sleep. I'm a success now. I'm trying so hard not to tip. Ow. You need sleep? Stop hitting me with the stick, dude, I swear to God This is the plan, this is the one we should have done. Don't hit me with that anymore. Oh! That was the one. You little bitch. And Charlie was, like, "I'm gonna jam that stick up your ass." And then Frank was, like, "Come here, you little bitch, uh, God damn it." Don't need to repeat all of the obscene language. Oh, I'm sorry, Father. I I got lost in the moment because I'm a natural storyteller. Oh Anyway, I was being super prudent, and I was mapping out my successful lifestyle-- you know, champagne, sailing. I've always wanted to sail. I was really the only one who was handling the success with class, to be honest with you. When Dee interrupted me with some lazy plan to get out of working. Lazy's a sin, right? Uh, you mean sloth? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Dee is guilty of sloth, and she's pro-abortion. Hey. Okay, listen to this. One sec. Just picking out the places I want to avoid when I sail across the world. No Africa for you, huh? No. I don't want to go to any poor places, you know. Successful guy like myself, I'll have a target on my back. Right. So, I guess Okay. Well That's, uh And, uh, too cold. Yeah. Ugh. Too violent. Yeah, it's hot down there. Too angry. Oh, the whole thing? You're just going to sail around the United States is what it looks like. That's all you're Uh, well, I probably want to avoid, like, this. Yeah. Don't blame you for that. And I don't know what happens out here. Okay, I tell you what. Uh, while you were planning all of this, I came up with an amazing idea that's going to save everything for us. You ready for this? We get ourselves replacements. That's not a very good idea. Well, stay with me. They're not just any replacements. They'll be the total embodiment of us in looks and personality so that we maintain the same group chemistry and avoid tipping. So they'll be like our avatars? Sure, if that helps you. Let's tell Dennis. Okay, yeah. Hey, hey, hey, Dennis, wake up. I'm not sleeping. What are you doing? Why are you hiding under the covers? Mm. My God. Do I look foolish? Well, what in God's name have you done to your face? I got a chemical peel. You look like a monster, dude. I was just trying to live up to all of your expectations of me. What expectations? Physical perfection. What? Clearly, the success of the bar has proved that I have achieved physical perfection. And now there's nowhere else for me to go but down from here. So now I'm hanging on by a thread. Why don't you lay off the skin treatments for a while? Yeah, yeah. Oh, you don't think I should mess with my face anymore? Well, right now it looks like you're wearing a mask of yourself over your face. Mm-hmm. Not a good one, not a nice mask of myself? Not a good one. Do you guys think that a normal mask of me might look good? Oh, my God. And if there was, would you guys wear it? What is happening? I'm very confused. I'm going to be alone. Okay. And without Dennis to shit all over Dee's ideas with me, I was lured into her very lazy, slothy, sinful avatar plan. Mm, I got to say, I like what I'm seeing here. Mm-hmm. Yeah, let me, uh let me just fill you in on what we're doing here. See, Mac and I run the hottest bar in Philadelphia, and we are looking for a couple of employees to fill our shoes, literally. Mm. That said, there's a set of dumbbells to your feet there. I'd like you to lift those and curl them, but don't do it in a normal way. Now, this is for a bartending job, right? Yeah. Yeah, this is all part of it. Now, get to work beefcake. Okay. Guess I can fire off a couple reverse curls. He said fire off. I like that. Yeah, I heard him. I like that. Look look at that. Excellent. Oh, man. He executed those perfectly. Uh. That was exactly what I'm talking about. I'd like to fast-track him, Dee. He's perfect. What? For you? Yeah, of course. What do? He looks nothing like you. Well, no. I mean, since we've been working, I've been neglecting my fitness regimen. He understands No, no, no, no. You never, ever once in your life have looked like that. When I leave the gym, and I have a full pump Yeah? Dee was right though. For me to use that gorgeous muscle monster as my avatar, I had to put on some serious bulk. So did you go to the gym? The gym? Father, when Peter did the statue of David, he wasn't just hammering at pebbles. First, he ordered the Jews to bring him a massive slab of marble. Okay. Let's wrap this up. Right. Okay, so Charlie was working his ass off. Uh, but the customers were getting just as frustrated as he was. Clearly, the pressures of success were cracking both he and Dennis. Hang on a second. Hang on a second. I got this guy. I got my man right here. You're the one who wanted the, uh, two Coors Lights and the gin and tonic. Is that right? No. I've been waiting half an hour for a Jack and Coke. You've been waiting half an hour? You've been waiting half an hour? Well, with an attitude like that, you can wait another half an hour, buddy. Hey, this drink tastes like bleach. Because I'm dipping them in bleach so that I can clean them faster. I don't have time to wash every single glass. I dip it in bleach, then it's clean! I'm not drinking bleach. Then get out of my bar! Get out of my bar! I don't want to see you. Is that your buddy? You go with him. No, I don't even know him. You don't even know him. Okay, well, become friends, and you walk home! Get out! Unbelievable. What's going on, man? What's going on, dude, is that I'm completely overwhelmed. I suck at bartending. I'm going crazy. Everyone's yelling at me. They're getting all pissed off. Why is your face shiny? I had my skin peeled off wh chemicals. Yeah? Want to know why? Not really. Well, it's just, uh, you know, I've created a level of success for myself that, uh, I just don't know if I can live up to it anymore, man. My level of excellence is so high that I'm feeling the pressures, man. Dude, I'm operating at such an excellent level. It's insane. You know, I'm running at of ten of excellence, and I'm used to being at whatever number. I-I don't even want to be at a-- like, somewhere lower, but whatever. The point is that I'm not going to let the bar down. You know what I mean? He being on the tipping point is about working hard and caring about that work and really giving it your all. Let's get high in the back office. Let's get high and drop all this, right?
 Yeah.
 Yeah. Deandra, you got to-- all you have to do is hold the pigeon, and I stick the M80 under its wing, I blow it up. No, Frank. I'm not going to help you detonate a pigeon. That would be terrible publicity for a young comedienne. Well, you-you don't have to do anything. I just-- we stick the pigeon in there, we run, the flock blows up, we got a lot of tasty meat. Hold on, hold on. Shut up. We have a pigeon feast. Shut up. What's going on? Where is everyone? I have all kinds of new bits and no audience. Oh, shit. Maybe we tipped too soon. No. No. I was just starting to get a taste of success. I need more. What's that? Music. Coming from in the back. Back here? What? Hey! What the hell are you ck bags doing back here? The bar is completely empty. I'm watching Charlie do his thing, and it's good, man. It's, like, good. It looks like we did tip, Deandra. We might as well sin and get high. I mean, I'm a sinner, too, right? Oh, ho, ho. Oh, Mac's the best. Oh, I love him. Isn't he? Also, I'm pro-abortion, so I'm probably going straight to hell. Oh, oh, and I got fat. I'm much fatter than Mac. You're so fat, and, uh  Oh, big, fat, big, fat Big, fat titties Big, fat ass.  You got big, fat titties.  Mm-hmm, over here  And I like to kill babies, unborn babies. I'm not exactly sure how that conversation went, but I imagine it was along those lines. The point is, six weeks later, they dropped a bomb on me. We're not idiots. Of course, I'm going to take the precaution of boiling the blood before I use it. Yeah, now, that goes without saying. No, no, no. It does not matter if you boil it, Charlie. You can't you can't replace Frank's blood with bags of blood that you found behind a hospital. But wait, wait. It just won't work. Dennis, he's not going to replace my blood. He's going to add to it to make me more virile. I'm just pumping more in. Yeah. So you're just going to be bursting at the seams with blood? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Hey-o. What's up, bitches? I did it. I'm 200 pounds. I'm as big as my avatar. What's an avatar? You know the avatar that we're going to get to do all of our work for us, so I can go sailing, and-and Dee can tell her stupid jokes, and Dennis can pour more acid on his face. Are we still doing that? No. We-We gave that plan up a really long time ago. Is that why you've been stuffing your face for six weeks? Yeah. I've been trying to get as big as my avatar, so we don't tip. Dude, that was, like, a million plans ago. All of us, including you-- we've been engaged in many other plans and schemes since then. Wh-Where have you been? You guys dropped the tipping plan? Yeah. I thought we were just putting it on the back burner until I hit two hundo. Why do you think we've been calling you fat this entire time? Wh Why wouldn't somebody tell me that we dropped the plan? Stop chewing on food and start thinking about what's going on in the bar, and then you Don't-Don't make fun of me, okay? I'm-I'm busting my ass out there trying to do the avatar plan, and-and now you guys are laughing at me. But you have candy coming out of your pocket. I was hungry. I was hungry. Don't laugh at me. Don't laugh at me! Don't laugh at me. Is he trying to rip his shirt off? What are you doing? You guys are going to hell, okay? You guys are going to hell. Don't laugh at me. What are you doing? "Don't laugh at me." And that's it. So, now you understand. I understand none of it. Father, my friends totally boned me. They became successful, egotistical monsters. They forced me into this avatar thing, and now they're totally ditching the plan. But it's all about the avatar. The beefcake avatar. But you weren't going to understand that unless I told you the whole story. I'm going to be perfectly honest. I still don't know what you want me to do. Okay, um, let me start at the beginning, because clearly, you didn't understand it. No, no, no, no, no, no ,hat won't be necessary. Uh, if, uh if I smite your friends and absolve you, will you leave? Yeah. You're absolved, and your friends are smited. In the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, please leave. Okay, great. Oh, um, when should I see the results? What are you talking about? Well, when does the spell kick in? Wh-When is God going to shed some of this weight for me? Six weeks. Great. Not hard. Perfect. Uh, glory unto you, ghost man in the sky, that created us all and pre-determines everything. I'll see you in six weeks.                     MAC: Dennis, do you have the tickets? DENNIS: Yes, affirmative. I got the tickets on-line, and I got the last ones. Charlie, got booze? CHARLIE: So what do you think? I think that's enough booze to last the whole movie, right? ALL: Yes. We're good, we're good. Dee, time? SWEET DEE: Uh, we have just about a half hour. Precisely, you bitch! I need to know precisely. FRANK: Oh, the city is like a zoo. I mean, traffic jam like you wouldn't believe. Obama's got the whole thing congested. Oh, goddamn it, Mac. I told you there was gonna be traffic, dude. I forgot about Obama! We still have time. We still have time. No, but, dude, traffic's gonna jam us up, man. No, no, no, we can make it, okay? Time for what? Time for what? Where are you going? We gonna go see Thundergun Express, man. You know what I'm talking about. What the shit is a Thundergun? Are you crazy, dude? It's, like, the greatest movie ever made. It's about this warrior from a post-apocalyptic underground society who has to travel back in time to save his lover from an evil robot army. (Frank laughs) Whoo "No hesitation." "No surrender. ALL: No man left behind!" It's only the biggest movie in America. Whoa, that sounds the tits. I'm in. No. How? How? No. You do not have a ticket. Yeah. You didn't buy me a ticket? I'm sorry. What am I? Your daddy? Yeah, I don't just buy tickets for people. Yeah. Well, I'll tell you what? I'll take Deandra's ticket. You don't like action movies. I don't know, Frank. This is just as much a love story as anything else. Plus, I hear the guy hangs dong, and I'm very interested in seeing that. Me, too. Yeah, yeah, he hangs dong. Mm-hmm. What the hell am I gonna do? Well, get out of the way, 'cause we gotta go. Yeah. The clock's ticking. Let's, let's go. Thundergun! This blows, dude! Drive faster. Drive faster? Where would you like for me to go? I'm surrounded by cars, Charlie. It's all these goddamn immigrants come in to see Obama. And none of them have any insurance. That's why they drive so slow. Why are you even here? The movie is sold out. I'm gonna scalp a ticket. Oh, shit! I didn't bring my wallet. You guys gotta spot me some dough. (laughs) I ain't giving you shit. Oh, I'll sneak in. I sneak in all the time. I just hope we get there in time to all sit together. I don't like to split up. Nah, don't worry about it. If we get split up, we'll just yell over everybody to each other until they get annoyed with us and switch. You call in a bomb threat, that would delay the picture. That would be very Thundergun. We're gonna have to do something drastic if Dennis doesn't figure out a way to drive faster. Yeah, come on, man. Where would you like for me to drive? He misses all of his angles. Well, you can slide in front of that Prius. Go in front of that Prius. Oh, okay, so then I'll be stuck in front of the Prius instead of right next to the Prius. It's a bigger problem than that guys. He's slow at everything. You should see how long it takes him to bang chicks. Mac, that's because you always try and barge in so you can see the chicks naked. And then I have to start the process all over again. But you waste so much time talking to them when you should be plowing them. No, you don't get it, dude. You don't get what I'm Look, I'm forging a connection with these women that will yield for them the most awakening and unforgettable sexual experience of their lives. Whatever! I don't care about any of this! We're gonna miss the movie! Yeah, come on. Hey, Thundergun it up on the curb. Yes, go on the curb! Thundergun it all the way down. Thundergun's not a verb. Stop using it as a verb. There's nothing I can do. It's the man's name. Just calm down. We'll get there. Well, I tell you one thing. I could walk faster than we're moving. What are you guys doing? Oh, wait! Get back here, you sons of bitches! (car horn honking) Thundergun leaves no man behind! We'll come back for you! Are you kidding me? Come on! (horn honking) (horns honking) Damn. Please. Shit. All the streets are blocked. Hey, let's ask this cop. Excuse me, Officer. Uh, we need to get through. I can't help you. The street's closed down all the way to Spring. Yeah, but this is an emergency. It's not my problem. You gotta go around. (grunts) All right, we gotta find a new point of entry. Attack the target from a different angle. Whoa! Hold on. What are you talking about attacking?! No, no, no, we're not terrorists or anything. We're just We're trying to get to a movie, Thundergun Express. Oh, Thundergun Express, huh? You better get going. You don't want to miss one second of that movie. Is it that good? It's the best goddamn movie I ever seen in my life. (all groan) Dude, hangs dong. I told them that! I told them! I don't want to miss that! All right, maybe we take a cab. What about that? A cab? Dee, don't be a fool! We'll never get a cab out here. Plus, we'll just sit in traffic like everybody else. Yeah, we'll be stuck like Dennis. (trolley bell dings) The trolley! The trolley. We can make it, Frank! Come on! Yes. No surrender, baby! Come on! Come on, Frank. I'm coming. Come on. You can make it. I'm coming. No, no, no, no, no! I'm not gonna make it. No, hop off! Hop Don't leave me here! We'll come back for you! You bastards! (horns honking) "You take too long. You take too long, Dennis." Screw you, Mac. I don't take that long. I'll show you who takes too long. Son of a bitch. Let's see. We got Amanda, we got Brenda. Ah, Alison. Let's find out if Alison thought that I, that I took too long. ALISON: Too bad the museum is closed on Wednesdays. I know. I guess we can hang out here and get to know each other instead. That's a good one. (clicking) What's with all the locks? I want you to feel safe. (tape fast forwarding) So your father took off when you were pretty young, huh? That must have been difficult. Yeah, I could probably speed things up a little bit. I mean Thanks very much. Careful now. There you go. Watch your step, ladies. Very good. Thank you. Hey, guy, can you can you take me up the river? I gotta get a mile up the river. Tour is $15. I left my wallet at home. I only got a, I got a quarter to my name. Look, I can't help you, pal. All right, folks. Everybody, take your seats. I'll be right back. We'll get this tour underway, okay? Hang in there. I swear, I'll take care of you when I get up there. Sorry, dude. Hi, I'm your new captain, Frank. I'm gonna take you up the river, okay? Here we go. What happened to Captain Tom? Uh, Captain Tom turned out to be a goddamn junkie! Hang on. (passengers gasp) You, uh, you're going too fast. Huh? Too fast. It's the, it's the fast tour. It's the quick one. Quick tour. (men speaking native language) Why aren't you telling us what anything is? Like what? What is that building over there? Uh, that's a big building. It's a brick building, red brick building. I don't know that the hell it is. It's a old building. (clamoring in native language) Can you please use microphone? Very difficult for people to hear in back, okay? Oh, oh, the microphone. Okay. All right. (spits) You hear that? Yeah. Yeah, okay. Well, we're on the Schuylkill River, and, uh, it's home to many, uh, weird fish-like creatures. And also the depository of, uh, all of the unsolved crimes and murders in Philadelphia. (group murmuring with interest) Yeah. That trolley kicked ass. We're just like a couple blocks from the theater, I think. Yeah. Thundergun himself would have been proud of that move. Of course, he'd be proud. We didn't hesitate. We didn't surrender. Yeah. We did leave a couple men behind, though. That's true. But we didn't hesitate to leave those men behind. Yeah. Plus, I hung dong on the trolley. You guys missed that. No, I didn't miss it. I saw it. I just chose to ignore it. I saw it. Looked like a button in a fur coat. Either way, it was totally Thundergun. If Thundergun's dong looks like that, we should all get our money back. Yeah, I'm walking out of the movie. It was more of a ding than a dong really, Mac. I got a lot of good ones and thumbs up and (car horn honking) Aw. Goddamn it. Another closure. All right, think, think. What would Thundergun do right now? Oh, shit. Okay, listen, hear me out. Let's fire down that sewer. Frank and I do it all the time. I know my way around. We'll be over there in a jiff. Uh, I don't know. Sewer, huh? All right, let's do it. We've come this far, right? Right? No, no, no, no. Our clothes will get soaking wet. It's going to ruin the whole movie. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. I know what it is. He's scared he's going to be too fat to fit down that gutter. That is what it is. No, it isn't. It has nothing to do with it. Look, sewers are disgusting, that's why. Your big fat body is what's disgusting. And you're embarrassed about it. We are not going in the sewer, and that is final. (car horn honking) Oh, oh, yeah? Ah. Guys, guys, guys, come on. Don't goddamn it. I'm coming through, guys. Here I come. Here I come. Oh, wait. Oh, you know what? It turns out I-I am I am too muscular, and I-I can't fit through. Look like you're stuck, huh? Well, yeah. So my-my-my muscles stop me from gaining access. Sorry, Mac. Why don't you guys come out, and then I'll tell you what? We'll come back for you. Yeah. That's what I told Dennis and Frank, and I was lying. I know. So are we! You sons of bitches! Oh, you sons of bitches! You sons of bitches! Out of the way, you fat dickhead. (car horn honking) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. No surrender. No surrender. Shitty bike. (car horns honking) (rewinds tape) (on tape): You seem cold. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable under the covers. Now, we're talking. Okay, Alison. All right. Hey, hey, guys. What are you do Mac, can we help you? Goddamn, Mac. Oh, oh, I thought I heard you call my name. I did not call your name. Oh, okay. Well, I'll be right outside if you need anything. We're not gonna need anything, okay? If fact, go ahead and leave the keys in here. Now I have to re-demonstrate my values, so that's gonna increase the time. (locks clicking on tape) I think I need to be getting home. My mom is going to start to worry. Wait. Your mom? How old are you? Sixteen. Sixteen?! No get what are you get Whoa, shit. That's not good. Why do I still have this tape? That's ridiculous. (car horns honking) Goddamn it. Shit. Well, now, this is an interesting development. (mouthing) I gotta say, Charlie, this sewer is pretty gross, but it's not nearly as gross as I thought it was gonna be. No, it's no bad now. But like any minute, you know, a wall of water could just come gushing through here. So we should keep moving. Wait, wall of water? Yeah, well, you know, it's not just water. It's like dog shit and street sludge. You know, they divert it to different channels throughout the day. Oh, my God. You know, it's sewage. It's sewage. Yeah. Oh, you know what, Dee? Dee? Can we get naked really quick? No. Oh, right. Do you mind if I do? Mm-hmm. Well, see the thing is, like, if a, if a wall of water comes through, it's actually pretty sweet to be naked 'cause then you can hold your clothes up. You know, and then that piss and shit just kind of flows over you. It's more refreshing than you think. And then you have dry clothes afterwards. And it's a lot better than having the sewage on your clothes. I understand. And I'm a little relieved, but it's still not good enough for, so I'm going to keep my clothes on. Oh, look at Queen Dee, who's too good to get naked with her buddy all of a sudden. Okay, I don't why are you making it about that? I just I didn't want You know what? t? This is a preposterous conversation we're having. This is a functional conversation. This is a preposterous conversation. This is not a sexual thing. You know what? Let's just go. Let's just go. There's no walls of water. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Shit. My shoe's stuck. Well, pull it out. If I could pull it out, would it be stuck? Take your shoe off. I'm not going to take my shoe off and walk around barefoot in this disgusting sewer. Oh, the queen again, everyone. The queen speaks. Shut up. Charlie, we don't have time for this. I have an idea, though. Why don't you take your shoes off and give them to me? No, you'll stretch mine out. No, come on, Charlie, you were fine taking all your clothes off and walking around in this gross place. Dee, you'll stretch them out. All right, Charlie, stop screwing around, okay? We're going to miss the movie. No, we're You're right. Where are you going? What are you doing? I'll come back for you. No. No. I'll come back for you. Don't don't you do that. Don't you Charlie, get back here right now! Goddamn it! Oh, goddamn it! Aw, man! Come on. Come on. (rumbling) What is that? What is that? Charlie? Is that the wall of water? No, Charlie. Charlie, I hear the wall of water! Come back for me! (screams) So they'll send a tow truck and everything? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't worry about that. Tow truck is on its way. I see you were born 1985. Si. Yeah, so everything checks out there. Beautiful. Oh, it's so cool that you own a chain of auto body repair shops. I wish I new how to fix cars. Oh, yeah. Well, auto body repair has always been a bit of a passion of mine. I also invented Facebook with the Winklevoss twins. Really? Yeah, yeah. Zuckerberg didn't do shit. Yeah, he really screwed us on that one. I got some hush money, so it's all good. It's all good. But, uh, I don't want to waste anymore time here, so No man left behind! Goddamn it, Mac. What the hell are you doing here? I came back for you like I said I would, like Thundergun does. Who's the brown girl? Uh, Elena. We got into a little bit of a fender bender. She was on her way to see Thundergun, too. What are the odds of that, huh? I seen it twice already. Oh, it's amazing. What's with the helmet, bro? Pretty cool, huh? Yeah, bonito. Dude, the helmet is sweet as shit. It's very Thundergun. (car horn honking) I'm going to wear it during the movie. (car horn honking) Looks like traffic is clearing up, huh? Yeah, it does. All right. Punch it. And Charlie and I, we go down the sewer. And first thing we do is to preserve our clothes, we take take our clothes off. We get totally naked because you don't want to get wet. We ball our clothes up. We stick them up some place high. There's this waitress who Charlie's in love with. And, uh, I banged her. Charlie got really upset when I banged the waitress. Uh, but it was a lot of fun. She was a nice piece of ass. We don't know who you're talking about. Charlie. He's my buddy. We sleep together. We hang out together. Once I pooped in the bed. I blamed it on him. (laughs) One time the guys got hooked on crack. It was really crazy. Well, they found a baby in a Dumpster. They wanted to make some money with the baby, but nobody would buy the baby because it was white. So they had to turn it brown. We were fighting over the sword. And just about when we were about to hit each other with the sword, Social Services came in, thought we were killing the baby. I-I don't understand this tour. Charlie wrote this musical. Oh, man, it was really funny. I played a troll on the musical. A troll? Yeah. And it's called The Nightman Cometh. I could sing you my song, if you like. (speaking native language) You gotta you gotta pay the troll toll to get into this boy's hole. Yeah, and, uh But you gotta pay to get in. I was saying, "soul." He thought I was saying, "boy's hole." One of the things I like doing most is banging whores. I, uh, I go out and bang a lot of whores. Listen, here's the thing. I'm going to have to jump off here. So you guys enjoy the rest of the tour on your own, okay? How are we supposed to get back to our tour bus? That's your problem. Welcome to Philly. (all yelling) No hesitation. Nah, no surrender. No hesitation. No surrender. No surrender. No surrender. No surren (siren whoops) Oh, shit. I surrender. Coming soon to a theater near you. All right, okay, there's a nice way to do that. There's a nice way to do that. From the director Ooh! Aah! That's tart. This seat taken right here? Charlie, you made it. What's up, Mac?! I got a seat right in the middle, bro. Aw, dude, that's an awesome helmet, man. Thanks, dude. Yo, where's Dee? Uh, she couldn't make it, bro. Wasn't Thundergun enough. How about Dennis? Oh, yeah, he's here. He's Thundergunning some Mexican chick in the back. Nice. He's moving a lot faster than usual, huh? I think he's getting a hand job. Oh, I am. Hand job. Hey, can you guys, uh, maybe be quiet? Well, why don't you switch seats with us if it's bothering you so much. Just switch seats, you know what I mean? Just switch seats. Yeah, okay. All right. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Squeeze in, squeeze in. Hey, Dee, you made it. Yeah, you bet your ass I made it. Charlie, my clothes are dry. You held them over your head? Took them all off. Held them over my head. I told you that water was coming. No problem. Yeah. Excuse me, Miss? Yeah. But your stench is unbearable. It's bad, isn't it? Yes. That's shit in my hair, that's why. What if you switch seats, and then I can be closer to those guys and you can Babe, let's get outta here. We won't smell as much, and then you won't hear all the talking and Congratulations. This is a much better seat. So the water wall came, huh? Yeah, came with a vengeance. Dennis is getting a hand job in the back. Seriously? Yeah. Oh, congratulations. Well, we're all here. Except Frank. I wonder where Frank is? Okay, you got one phone call, make it quick. Thank you, ma'am. 911. What is your emergency? I'd like to report a bomb threat. He's not qualified Would you shut up? The movie's about to start. Can you shut up? Well, switch with us if you're getting so upset. Fine. Yeah, why don't you go up there and then We're having a conversation. Bad attitude. Talk about shutting up. Dennis, you're going to like the seat. At a certain point, it's your fault, you know what I mean, for not moving. That's right. This is Elena, everybody. Oh! Oh! (fanfare playing) This is going to be bad ass! (audience murmuring) What's going on? Folks, please don't panic, but we've received a bomb threat. We ask that you remain calm and exit the theater in an orderly fashion. Bomb threat? No. Bomb threat? Oh, shit. Goddamn it, Frank. He Thundergunned all of us. He Thundergunned the shit out of us. Frank?                        ALL: Reunion! Reunion! Reunion! Reunion! Reunion! Reunion!

No brace, fools! Baby got back!  Oh-oh, baby got back.  Dee, what are you doing? Baby, got back. You know that one. Sir Mix-a-Lot.  Baby got  Sir Mix-a-Lot was not talking about women whose backs have recovered from horrific spinal disorder. He was talking about gorgeous black women and their big beautiful black butts. FRANK: Black butts are good. Whatever. They're good, right? Guess what. Baby got back, and I can't wait to shove it into these fools' faces, so let's get going. Whatever. I don't give a shit. Let's just do what we always did before every school-sponsored event and let'ssmash 'em up? Let's smash 'em up! Oh Smash 'em up! Hey, right? I got these. What, what are you doing there, Charlie? Huh? Oh, I'm packing a couple extra pair of underwear in case I get an atomic wedgie. It's not gonna happen, dude. We're adults now. I'm not taking any risks here, all right? And if it does happen, I'm gonna get high, I'm gonna go to the bathroom, I'm gonna huff stuff. No, Charlie, you don't have to do things like that anymore. You don't need to huff shit or eat weird things to get people to like you. Nah, I think he does. You guys were pretty much nothing in high school. If he wasn't the class clown and you didn't sell drugs, you'd definitely be nothing; nobodies. Well, if shit happens, I'm going directly to Plan B. We're not gonna have to do Plan B, okay? You know, I'm gonna come right out and say that I'm not doing Plan B regardless of what happens with you guys. I'm only here for Plan B. Oh, shit. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Faculty or alumni? Neither one. Well, you can't go in. No, but we're friends. We're buddies. We hang out together. We do everything together. I don't care. Okay, look, I'm gonna go inside because, Frank, I can't have you ruining this for me. But what am I gonna do? I don't know! Hang out in the parking lot and drink beer till we're done. We smashed all the beers. Oh, no, actually, I have a few more. You guys want one? You can't bring those inside. Well, then guess what. All right. Smash 'em up! (all laugh) All right, turkey. See ya, Frank. See ya, jerk jerky. Oh, yeah, baby, this is great. This brings me back. I'm anxious, I'm excited, I can't wait to see the waitress. Charlie, give it a rest. I know, but we've been clicking lately. This is gonna be a good night for us. Like, remember how she was the coolest girl in school? What are you talking about? No. Well, she was definitely the prettiest girl in school. She was not. She was not, no. Maybe the most forgettable girl in school. Yeah, which, by the way, is the worst thing you could be in high school. Totally insignificant. Either way, good feelings are gonna get sparked up. I'm gonna see her, she's gonna see me. You guys, you guys, you guys. What? Brad Fisher. Brad Fisher. He is not gonna be happy to see me after that present I gave him. Uh, what present? Oh, the box of hornets. Ooh, that acne really came back, didn't it? Yeah, it sure did. The guy looks like shit. Mm-hmm. All right, I tell you what. Why don't you guys sneak past him, and Mac and I will pick up the name tags. Really? How does that sound? Yeah. Okay. We'll meet you inside. Okay. All right, go, go, go. All right, come on. Hey, hey, hey, it's Brad Fisher, all right! How you doing, buddy? BRAD: Not great. Oh, yeah, well, the acne definitely came back in full force. Yeah. That's a shame, but I have products that will clear that acne up, man. It's not acne, actually. No, no, it's hornet scars. Ooh! Ouch. Yikes. I don't think I have any products that'll, that'll take care of hornet scars. That's more of a Plastic surgery situation. Yeah, plastic surgery would do it, though. Yeah. But lasers Lasers would do it. They'd blast those monsters Yeah, yeah, yeah. You guys seen Charlie around? Charlie Kelly? Yeah. No. No, we don't, we don't associate with him anymore. All right, I'm gonna take off. Okay. Messy. Ooh-hoo-hoo. Let's stay out of that. Yeah, let's stay out of that. Let's just grab our name tags, huh? I don't see 'em over here. Oh, here we go. Okay, we got Charlie, we got Dee, I got myself right there. Yeah. And, uh, I'm not seeing yours. Yeah, I grabbed mine already. It's in my pocket. Oh, did you grab it? Yeah. Oh, okay, well, pop it on. Uh, I'm probably not gonna wear mine. I mean, who wears a name tag, right? That's not cool. I'm gonna wear mine. I'm seeing everybody else wearing their name tags, so just pop that on, buddy. Nobody calls me this anymore. And I feel like it's gonna confuse people. It's not, because everybody called you that in high school, so pop it on because it's definitely a rule and they're not gonna let you inside without it. It's been so long. It's probably not even my name legally anymore. You're gonna have to pop it on. (sighs) Okay. (heart pounding) Good. Well, okay, Ronald McDonald. Don't call me that. Well, it's your name. So, Ronald, I'm gonna take a little lap around, get people abuzz about my presence at the reunion. And I'll meet up with you guys later, okay? (chuckles) No one, no one calls me   Is he looking? Who? That guy? Yes, is he looking at my back rig now? Do you see the waitress anywhere? Come on. Shut up. He's not looking at your back, Dee. Are you sure? Why are you so obsessed with this guy? It's Adriano Calvaniste, Charlie. It's the guy who coined the name "Aluminum monster." Really? That's him?! Yes. That's cool. I want to meet him. You have met him, Charlie. He called you Dirtgrub and he made you eat spiders. Oh, that guy! Yeah. Oh, he was, like, so cool. He was, like, way above me. Yeah, him and his cronies all thought that they were way above you and everybody else, but I've got a plan to get revenge. I'm gonna sew myself into their inner circle. Cool. How you gonna do that? Well, I'm gonna lure 'em in with my good looks, and then as far as I remember, all you really got to do to get in with that crowd is be really cruel to people. Right. So I'm gonna gain their trust and when the moment's right, I'm gonna strike. Oh, cool, all right. I'm doing it for us, Charlie. Oh, okay. Thanks. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Is it, is it him? He's coming over. All right, do you see a spider I can eat? I can eat a spider. No, stop. Charlie, keep your mouth shut, keep your ADRIANO: Hey, um, excuse me, but aren't you the aluminum monster? Yes. I mean, no. People don't call me that anymore, but yeah. Nor should they. I mean, wow, you've, uh, you've really transformed. You look great. Really? Mm-hmm. Thanks. Hey, Dirtgrub. How are you? That's so cool. You're so cool, Adriano. Yeah. Hey, um, why don't you smell this? Well, it's probably poisonous, right? Probably, but, you know, smell it anyway. Should-should I smell it? Smell it. Come on. Whoa, whoa, whoa, Charlie! What are you doing, dude? Oh, he wanted me to smell a pen, and I was going to smell the pen, because it's Adriano You don't have to do that anymore. Hey, Ronald McDonald, right? No, no. For your information, nobody calls me that. Right, right. What did we call you? Ronnie the Rat. Ronnie the Rat, yeah, I remember, yeah, yeah. Why did we call him that anyway? 'Cause he was a nark and a tattletale, and he became the main drug dealer when he told on the other main drug dealer. Right, yeah, yeah, I remember. Well, looks like the rat got a little too much cheese, huh? Fat. That's not funny. I put on mass. We eat a lot of cheese. We eat a lot of cheese. To put on mass. Didn't you also give everybody ringworm? No, no. That was a rumor. I only gave ringworm to Charlie. I got it from my dog Poppins, and then Charlie and I were wrestling every day because we were trying out for the wrestling team, and then, you know, we just sort of passed it back and forth. We passed it back and forth Although then we did try out for the wrestling team, and then I do think a couple of the guys got it on the team, so yeah, you're right, you're right. Wow, yeah, yeah, no, that is really gross. I mean, that is Yeah, that's about as low as it gets. They probably still have it, 'cause they're so gay together. Totally. Hey, Dee, why don't you come back to our table-- you know, have a drink? Oh, yeah, okay. Yeah? That sounds cool. See you later, Dirtgrub and Ronnie the Rat. Hope you suck each other's rotten peckers until you get mouth cancer. Mouth cancer. Can I come to the table? No! For some reason, homophobia, it's just, it's awesome to these guys. I'm sewing myself in. I'm doing this for us, okay? What the hell is she talking about? She's going to strike when the moment's right. She's doing it for us, dude. Really? Yeah. Did you thank her? Of course I thanked her, absolutely. Oh, what's up, boys? Hey. All right, I got your name tags. Oh. Hey, did you get on Mac about his? Yeah, he's got It's not that It's not funny. That's so funny. Adriano came over, blasted him about it. Oh he did? Oh, good, oh good. So Adriano's probably going to tell everybody about it. That's going to get around the whole reunion. It'll get going round and round and round. Probably not. Probably getting old already. So listen, guys, this is where we part ways, all right? So do do not talk to me for the rest of the night, and know that I won't be talking to you, because you lower my stock. You guys get it. I'm going to go post up one of these tables around here, let my loyal subjects come and kiss my ring. Listen, don't laugh when people make fun of me. Yo, Stash. Stash. What's up, brother? Dennis. Sit down, man. Let's catch up a little bit. Okay, all right, I'll catch you later, man. Hey, if you see any of the old crew, let them know I'm posted up over here. I don't think they know I'm-- I'm here. Dennis. What are you? I snuck right by that security prick. Look, I got myself a name tag. I'm Nicki Potnick. Remember the time he crashed my car into the tree? He went crazy and the tire went down We had such a good time. Okay, Frank, first off, Nicki Potnick is a girl, okay? And secondly, she's not 65 years old. I don't want to talk to you. I don't want to be around you. Go find Mac and Charlie. Go, go, go. Why-- why are you sitting at a table with no people? I thought you were cool. I am cool. I'm the coolest kid here. I'm just, you know, posting up, and they're going to come to me. I don't know what's going on. MAUREEN: Hello, Dennis. Whoa. Oh, goddamn. You're late on your alimony. Can we not talk about alimony payments right now? We're at our reunion. Didn't think you'd run into your ex-wife, huh? No, I didn't think about it, Maureen, because I don't think about you. Really? No. What do you think about this? Oh, it wafted over here. The dead tooth-- it spurted in my nose, it stinks. What is that supposed to be? That's where your monthly payments are going. That's a diamond tooth, Dennis. A dead tooth, Maureen. With a diamond in it. Put a diamond on anything that's dead, and it's still dead, Maureen. It's rotting. Get it out of your face. Look, I don't want to talk about these things, all right? I don't want to talk to old men who are pretending to be women, and-and ex-wives, all right? I can't be seen like this. Hello, bitches. Oh, for! That's right, I'm off the wagon. Yeah. You know what, Dennis? I went to go find my name tag-- they didn't have one for me. Oh, really? All right, see you later. Yeah, I went to go find my name tag-- they didn't even have one. It's like-- it's like what, I never existed? I mean, who cares though, right? 'Cause it's high school. Who cares? (laughing) Me, too. Here we go, grab it. Oh, yes! Shots for everybody. Shots for the cool Oh, Rickety Cricket, everybody. Look at this. Rickety, rickety, rickety. (blubbering) (all laughing) Rickety Cricket! Cricks, how are you?

Or Two tickets per person, guy. I didn't ask you, pretty boy. It's a conversation between me and the longhair. Okay. None for him, or the fat bitch. (laughing) You making this about weight? He's gained a lot of weight. I'm not going to take some shit from some bartender. You're a bartender. He doesn't know that! Hey, did you guys see Ronald McDonald's his name? (laughing) Hey!

If those are fake, you can't get any of these beers. Come on. (Mac laughs) You got in trouble. You got in trouble! Wow. Ronnie the Rat strikes again, huh? Thanks a lot, douchebag. You're the worst, Dirtgrub. Yeah. I didn't have anything to do Don't sell me out. See what you did, man? We're supposed to be on the same team, Charlie. Aw see, high school sucks! You know what? I'm going to go to the bathroom, I'm going to find stuff to huff, I'm going to get high. If I'm the Dirtgrub, I'm going to be the Dirtgrub. (Mac sighs in exasperation) We're going to go into Plan B. Because I brought Dee's old back brace, and I got it in the car. So, we can implement Not now, Frank! A little rehearsal or something. No, Charlie, dude, you don't have to do this. We can find another way. Yes, I do! I'm just the Dirtgrub, okay? Everyone wants the Dirtgrub, I'll give 'em the Dirtgrub. I'll get high, I'll get sad. People can laugh at me. I hate high school, man.

Looks like you had a rough couple of years, there, Nicki. Uh, yeah. I'm a guy now. Mm. Right. Yeah. What are you guys doing, perving out on Dirtgrub over there? Yeah, probably. That's what these gay guys do, they just knock each other out with poppers, and then find some kinda rabies-infested rodent to tickle each other's taints with. (laughing) No. No, that's not what we're doing, all right? We are grown adults. We are respected businessmen now. You did kind of rat me out there, Ronnie, so Yeah, so, I guess it's time to pay the piper, Rat. And, uh old man I don't know. Whoa! No, no! What the hell are?! (yelling) Ah! Ow!

Can you believe I came to this thing? Yeah, I was posted up over there, I guess you guys probably didn't see me. No, we saw you. Oh, did you? Oh, okay, well no reason to be intimidated. You know? I'm a human being, after all. You know, just a just a man. Actually, we're good. Uh, no, Tim. We're not good. And you're definitely not good, because you haven't had the chance to hang out with me yet. Um my wallet's missing. Oh my God, my necklace is missing. Come on! My gold chain's gone. Have you seen my necklace? Oh, my. And with all the security. The fact you even need it Wait a second, Mara. What is that around your neck? Hmm? Oh, that's, uh probably just a ar that What the hell? Ah. (people exclaiming) Ah! I've sinned! My God, you are covered in ringworm. It's her fault. She told me she loved me. We were supposed to be together forever. Calm down, Cricks. What's he talking about? Dee, were you two together? No! Me, with him? I what are you, crazy? No! Yeah, I told him I loved him once, but that was like four years ago. You two probably have ringworm together, don't you? No! No, of course I don't have ringworm! No no no, stay away from me! To think I was going to let you jack me off Wait wait you were? Unbelievable.

I'm, like, anxious, I'm excited. SWEET DEE: It's Adriano Calvanese, Charlie. It's the guy who coined the name Aluminum Monster, but I've got a plan to get revenge. TIM MURPHY: Yo, Dennis! Shit! That's Tim Murphy, the asshole that slept with my prom date. Uh, this is my wife, Christie. Dennis and I used to be really good friends. MAC: Adriano made fake tickets! Those tickets are fake! Ronnie Rat strikes again, huh? FRANK: Wait. Ah! Goddamn I don't have ringworm. No, no, we're cool. Yeah, we're like, the Yeah. Oh! Oh! Oh, really? Aah! Son of a bitch. Well, this is great, Dee. This is just great. Used to be king of the mountaintop. Now I'm sitting alone at a table at my high school reunion with my sister, the Aluminum Monster. Yeah, I know, I was on the mountaintop, too, okay, Dennis? (scoffs) I got to find a way back there. Got to get a plan. Hold on! Hold on a second. Ingrid! Ingrid Nelson. Hey! INGRID: Hi, Dennis and Dee. Oh, carrying around a clipboard, huh? Dork. Yeah, well, I'm on the alumni association, so (speaking gibberish mockingly) (laughs) Fatty Magoo! Right? Everybody, Fatty Magoo. Honk! What? Don't What are you doing? She's not fat anymore. That doesn't really play. It's not Oh, really? 'Cause I'll see it on the sides, and I'll see it in the thighs. Still fat to me, still fat to you, Fatty Magoo, Fatty Magoo, Magoo, Magoo, Magoo, Magoo So, is this why you called me over here? Magoo, Magoo, Magoo, Magoo, Magoo, Magoo, Fatty Magoo, Fatty Magoo, Fatty Magoo! All right, it was super fun to see you guys. Right? Everybody, Magoo! Did anybody? Did you guys? Did you see her? Drop it. Oh, God, she just wasn't that fat anymore, was she? Yeah. No, she looks That felt very forced. Yeah, 'cause she's so pretty these days. Doesn't? She looked fantastic. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, she looked really good. Only kind of works when you're sitting at a table with the cool kids. That seemed pathetic and mean. Yeah, it was. It did. It did. Wasn't it? It was. Yeah. Yeah. I got to find a way back into that group. Dee, I think you need to stop focusing on how to get back in with them, and start focusing on how to get revenge on them. Yeah, you're exactly right. I need revenge on them. And that's what I want, too. Okay, well, what's our plan? What's our plan? Ooh, I want revenge. All right, so here's-here's how we're gonna do it. Yeah. I'm gonna bang Tim Murphy's black wife. Oh, shit. Yeah. Oh, shit! That'll do it. That's gonna humiliate him. That will humiliate him, yes! Totally. You know what I'll do? Hmm? I will bang Tim Murphy to get back at Adriano. Oh, that's a good plan. What?! Yes! The problem is, I don't think Tim Murphy would ever sleep with you. Wait a sec. Hold up. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you do? What's my part of the plan, then? Hmm Oh, grab this. We only get two drink tickets. Uh Whoa. What happened? Why am I hanging here? The cool kids got us. It was a massacre. Ah, shit! All right, you guys. I'm ready to be your friend again. No, Dee, get out of here. Get away from us. Get away from us. What are you doing? Look, you guys, I'm on your team, okay? I always was on your team. I had a strike plan, but then Cricket went and blew up my spot. You goddamn bitch! Okay, look, that's not the important thing, all right? Bitch! The important part is that I'm here now, and I'm on your team, and I want revenge, and I need you guys to help me come up with a plan. She's right. We need revenge, and I know how we're gonna get it. Yeah. Charlie, we got to get the freight train back together. Freight train? That's a great idea. That's like a plan. Nope. No, that's not a great idea. That's a terrible idea. What the hell is a freight train? It's a stupid group of imbeciles who called themselves a gang. It was basically just Charlie, Mac, and Dooley. May he rest in peace. God rest his soul. And they were basically just lackeys of this guy named Psycho Pete, who genuinely was mentally ill. Our conductor's insane. Our cargo is pain. Freight train! Freight train! Freight train! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Let's get a hold of this Psycho Pete and kick some ass. Yeah! Let's do it! Freight train! Yeah, get us down. No. No? No, I don't like that plan, so Huh? Come on, get us down, Dee. No. We're gonna kick some ass. Deandra, come back here. Come on! Goddamn (grunting) All right, let's just see if they have Psycho Pete's name tag and if they were expecting him. 'Cause, if we get our psycho back, we get the freight train back. Yes. What's his last name? Uh, I don't know. No, me, neither. Guess we weren't really that close. It would have been cool to be closer to him. Yeah. He was such a dark, mysterious guy, you know? Yeah. What about this Peter Schmidt-- is that the guy? No. Oh, no, that's Schmitty. Yeah, ah, shit, is he coming? No way. Schmitty would never come to something like this. Not his scene. If anything, he'll swoop in at the very end, grab the drunkest girl he can, take her home, bang her. Ha, Schmitty's so cool. Oh, yeah. Not that cool, though. Not as cool Way cooler than you, Dirtgrub. Not as cool as Adriano. Stop defending Adriano, okay? Will you stop with the Schmitty stuff? You know, snipping with each other-- it's, like Oh! Oh! Magoo! Hi. Hey! I saw you trying to get by us. I know. You can't get away from us, Fatty, Fatty Magoo, Fatty Magoo. No, I'm not fat anymore. That's not even accurate. Ha. That's true. Well, you used to be fat. I don't know. Yeah, well, I'm not now. I had a thyroid problem. What's your excuse? I've tacked on mass. Really? I've tacked on lots of mass, yes. All right, all right, now, do you remember Psycho Pete? Unfortunately, yes. Any word on if he's coming tonight, or? Well, I hope not. He's the reason we have extra security. He threatened to burn down the building. Ha. That's He was probably just joking. That's his sense of humor. He has a very dark sense of humor. You know, you got to lighten up around Pete. Was he joking when he cut his family into little pieces and ate them for Christmas dinner? That doesn't sound like a joke. Did that really happen? Yeah, that sounds much more serious. That's-That's grizzly. Grizzly? Psycho. Psycho is how it sounds. Psycho-- that's what it is. Psycho. That's how he got out of prison. Oh, the insanity plea. Yes. Okay, well, that makes sense. I would have gone with that if I was his attorney. Uh, although, really I specialize in bird law, so I don't want to mess around That's awesome. So, it was really nice to, uh Okay. (Frank laughs) So I guess the freight train is gone, is that it? Yeah. Yes, let's get out of here. Yes, I guess we're of to It's over. Hey, you guys, you guys, you guys, okay, hi! Oh, good to see you guys again. Change of plans, okay? I can't think of my own thing to do, so I want to join the freight train or whatever it is. Get lost, bitch. No, no, no, no! Hang on a second. Hang on a second. Now, guys, the freight train never let a loser down in need. If Dee wants in on the freight train, we have to let her in on the freight train. Dee just has to do one thing. She's got to go through the freight train initiation. We got to know that Dee's one of us. So, Dee? Yeah? Are you willing to go through the freight train initiation? Yes, I am. Oh, no, no! Oh, goddamn! Oh, no, no! I am a grown woman! I am a grown woman! Aah! (pop ballad playing) (groans): I mean, cuff links? Tim, at a high school reunion? It's not the Oscars. I mean Oh. (laughs) Geez! Yeah, and he can be a little too nice sometimes. Oh. Can get a bit boring. Oh, trust me, Christie, he's boring as shit. I know that, all right? I'd rather get blasted in the balls by a battering ram than have to have a conversation with the guy. You're crazy! (laughing): Am I crazy? Am I? Yes. He deceives people, Christie. No. That's what he d Oh, yeah. He steps on his friends to climb to the top of the mountaintop, where his good friend used to reign supreme, that's what he does. I mean, quite frankly, Christie, (laughs) I think you can do a lot better than him. No, he's good to me. Mm-hmm. Yeah, but does he appreciate you? I mean, Christie, does he appreciate all of that? Dennis! Baby's got back, Christie. Baby's got back. You know what I'm saying? Am I right, though? Am I right? Listen, listen, listen. I want to be inside you. I want to do shit to you that is gonna make you realize what a worthless, boring piece of shit your husband really is. Wait a second, I'm confused. Why would you want to have sex with me? Why the hell wouldn't I want to have sex with you? I mean, bam, boom, boom. Because you're gay. What?! I'm not gay. Dude, you're wearing makeup. Yeah, I'm wearing a little bit of makeup. Who-who doesn't And a girdle. Yeah, I wanted to seem thin for the occasion. That's not weird. You've also been gossiping with me for the last 20 minutes. I was speeding through the steps. I have a system that I was demonstrating value on the dance floor, and then I engaged you physically when I put my hands on your hips. Now, I'm nurturing your dependence by letting you talk shit about your boring, worthless, piece-of-shit husband. Then I was gonna take you to an empty broom closet and I was gonna bang the shit out of you. And then I was gonna neglect you emotionally. That's what I do, Christie. And it was working. I was manipulating your feeble little brain into doing what I want-- what I want! And then now it's what you want. Ew! Oh, ew! Yeah, aw, oh, yeah, okay, well, your husband is a liar, how about that, Christie? Yeah, stay with a liar! And a deceiver. You Tim does not deserve to be the king of the mountaintop. I am the king of the mountaintop! (music stops) I reign supreme over everyone in this school. I am the golden god of this place. I reign supreme. I! I! (chatter, music resume) Dee, I'm sorry we threw your back out, but you're lucky that's the worst thing that happened. And it's a lucky thing I brought the back brace. Oh, yes, lucky! So lucky! I'm feeling very, very lucky to have my asshole ripped in half like tissue paper by my father and his very good friends. A-A-And also, I'm feeling incredibly lucky to be making another appearance as the Aluminum Monster after so many years. Thank you, thank you. And I don't think you're gonna get to bang Adriano now, either. Oh, you don't think so, Charlie? You don't think so? Guys, this whole thing has been a wash, all right? Let's just get out of here, because there's no way that we're gonna get revenge on those guys without Psycho Pete. Yeah, I've been humiliated enough. You son of a bitch! You bastard! You bastard! Whoa! Jesus Christ! (Dennis yells) Dennis, you're coming out hot. (panting): I am the king of the minions, not Tim Murphy! Not that jerk-off idiot! He jerk-off! What the hell are you doing, man? She rejected me. Me, Frank, me! The coolest guy in the history of this goddamn school! Oh, they're all gonna pay. They're all gonna pay the ultimate price! Whoa! (Sweet Dee gasps) Dude, what's all that stuff you're grabbing? Tools! Tools! Uh, duct tape, zip ties and gloves! I have to have my tools! (panting) Well, why do you have a bunch of, like, weird tools in a hidden compartment in your car? It's fetish, it's fetish shit! I-I-I-I like to bind I like to be bound. Uh, that's not important! There has to be questions! I'm not taking questions! The golden god is not taking questions! I am the golden god! And I'm taking action. I got to go. I Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a second, Dennis, wait a second. (Dennis groans) I think we can help you, dude. Yeah? Yeah, we can help each other. We both want the same thing. Revenge. (Dennis panting) You're gonna be our new Psycho Pete, pal. And guess what? The freight train's back in service! Let's get nuts in that school. Let's get crazy, all right? Come on, let's get some revenge here. Train's coming. Watch out for that train. Watch out for that train. The train's coming! Make way! Freight train coming through! All aboard! Choo-choo! No, we don't do the toot-toots We're a train. Why wouldn't we toot-toot? It's just not what we do, okay? Okay, bitches! Get ready for the steam engine! And get it! I'm gonna destroy you all. But I want Murphy first. So let's go, Murphy, you and me, once and for all. Come on! What you gonna do now, pussies? We got our psycho back. Yeah! What the hell are you guys talking about? Talking about the freight train, cowboy! Look, everybody, the Aluminum Monster's back. It's a good look. Ha-ha, yeah, yeah, it's really good, it's really Just send Murphy out, so our psycho can bash him. Okay, you guys, let's get out of here-- this is weird. See you. Where you going? You afraid? (all mock crying) No. We're not afraid; we're in our 30s. We don't fight people anymore. It's kind of pathetic. Yeah? Well, too bad, 'cause the fury's already coming, bitch. So too late. Oh-ho-ho, you just couldn't stand it, could you? You couldn't stand Dennis Reynolds reigning on high! King of all the school! Master of everybody! You couldn't stand it, so you had to turn everybody against me. Dude, listen to yourself. Nobody turned anybody against you. You were never that cool to begin with. Seriously, man, you would just come around saying weird shit about being a golden god or some other insane crap. And referring to all of us as your minions. You always acted like you were better than everybody else, but then you'd just go and you'd hang out with Ronnie the Rat or Dirtgrub under the bleachers or behind a Dumpster or something. It was it was really weird. Weird. Yeah, sure, okay. Yeah, well, if I wasn't the coolest guy in school, then why did you have to try and tear me down by sleeping with my prom date? (chuckles): I didn't sleep with your prom date. Yes, you did! No, I didn't. Ronnie the Rat did. Wait, what? Ronald McDonald slept with your prom date. Did he tell you that I slept with her? I never would have slept with that chick. She was gross. She was gross. (quietly): She was gross. She was gross, I remember that, yeah. She was really gross. You slept with my prom date? No. Yes. How could you do that to me? It was very easy. Uh, she was a whore. I'm gonna kill you. No, don't. I'm gonna kill you! I'm gonna kill you, you fat piece of shit! This is mass! This is mass! Don't make it about my weight! You guys are good. So Take care! I know she was a whore, but she was my whore! All right! Calm down! This is pathetic. This is awful. We've all been humiliated. Our asses are destroyed. Yeah. Mm-hmm. And Dennis turned out to be a loser. You know what? Let's just go back to the bar, right? The bar's where we belong. The bar's where we fit in. We can hide from the world at the bar. Yes, yes, I agree with Charlie. I never want to step foot in this high school ever again. Right? Yes. No! We can't go out like that. Look, if life pushes you down, you got to push back. If you're dealt a bunch of lemons, you got to take those lemons and stuff them down somebody's throat until they see yellow. And if some punk-ass kid humiliates you, you got to do the only thing that's left to do. Yeah! Whoa, whoa. Yes, Frank. Oh, wow, that was a great speech, man. That's the most coherent thing that's ever come out of your mouth. That was awesome, dude. You usually just ramble on and on and on. That was like a basketball coach. All right, so what is it? Yeah. Yeah. Huh? What's the one thing left to do? What is it? Well, the thing of it is, is that, uh, there's the lemon stuff. Right. And then you got Mac, who's a rat. And Dee's body brace. And, uh, and that's the thing of it, and It's good. What are you saying? No, you were gonna tell us what to do. That doesn't we didn't ask if something was good or if it wasn't good. I lost my train of thought. Let's go back to the bar. Yep. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Were you gonna suggest that we should do plan B? No. Plan B! That's what I was going to say! That's we're not doing plan B. Listen, man, hey, listen. We worked so hard on it. Come on, we're not doing plan B, it's ridiculous. Dennis, Dennis, plan B might be the only option we have left. Ah, come on. Come on, Dennis. Jesus, come on, plan B is (chanting): Plan B, plan B Shh, not too loud. No, it's All right, all right. Will you stop whispering plan B like it's some super covert CIA operation? Plan B is a dance routine. It's a goddamned dance routine. And it's gonna rock. Beep beep. Get out of here. Beep beep bop. We're gonna need this dance floor Clear the dance floor. Clear the dance floor. Let's go, let's go. Bring it on, bitches! Go on! All right, listen up, jerks! Listen to us, listen to us. There's been a lot of negative energy going on at this school, okay? So I want to talk to you guys a little bit about dancing. Now, back in the '50s and the '60s and the '70s, people used to dance all the time. That's the way we solved our problems back then. That's how they solved their problems-- through dance. Then, all of a sudden, we stopped dancing. You know? Grunge came in, we dressed in plaid and oversized jeans. Then, later on, kids wore trench coats and shot each other in school, and that's not cool. But guess what. Guess what's going on in the high school now. Kids are dancing again. Organized choreographed dance. They're doing organized choreographed dances to solve their problems. They also give each other blow jobs. They got these things called rainbow parties. No, Charlie. All right, wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up. Let's go. No, but they have these rain Yeah, but that's not the point of the The point is, we're gonna show you a dance! Let's get started. Let's go! Lights. (music playing) (crowd cheering) (whistling)   (cheering and applause) (cheering) (beeping)   (cheering) Ah! (groaning): Ah! Ah! Five, six, seven, eight. (music stops) (Frank vomiting) It's fine, it's fine. Well, that was weird. Hey, everyone! After party back at my house, all right? Everyone's invited. Except them. Let's go! (cheering) What (Frank coughing) That sucked. Yeah, man. It was a perfect dance. They just didn't respond to it. I don't understand how that didn't blow people's minds, though. Guys, guys, we did a great job, okay? Listen, don't, don't get down on yourselves, all right? Those people are stupid. They're idiots, they're savages. They just didn't get it. Oh, come on. (slurring): Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Wow, great dance, assholes. You know what? Just like you low-life shits, I didn't get invited to the after party either, but whatever. I'm just gonna have sex with somebody to feel better about myself. I'm gonna bang the next person who talks to me. So who's it gonna be? Hi-yah! How you doing, fellas? Hey, Schmitty, excuse me. How you doing, having fun? Hey, did I miss the festivities? Excuse What are we doing here? What's going on? Schmidt, no, no! Hey, how are you? Oh, do you want to have sex with me? Yes, I do. Well, there you go. See you, guys. Monster. Oh! You all right? Where do you want to go? You got a car? I don't know. We'll use mine, come on. Schmitty. Let's go back to the bar, huh? Yeah. Let's go, Charlie. Yeah. Schmitty just Schmitty. Swooped in and grabbed the most disgusting girl here.                    
 Okay, but now you make a right-hand turn
 Make a right turn. Okay, making a right. You should pass three fuzzy poles with blinking lights. Those are traffic signals. Okay. All right, wait a minute, I haven't gotten there yet! And, great. You should be making a left turn here. There's no left! You don't know where I am, tape. This ain't working, Charlie. This ain't working. You should pass three fuzzy poles with blinking lights. Those are traffic signals. I passed the traffic signals! You should pass three It's stuck! Charlie, I need you here! This tape isn't working. This is KPFN Public Radio. Today, on Do It Yourself Gardening: composting. I'm sure many of you are wondering what composting involves. You should pass three fuzzy poles with blinking lights. Hate those poles and the blinking lights! Make sure your compost pile gets plenty of air.
 Now
 Oh Sandra you dumb bitch. Wha? Charlie, what is so hard to understand? I believe that if I inseminated the right woman, our seed could potentially-- through an X-Men-type genetic mutation-- create a son capable of bending steel. Uh-uh. That's completely insane. Do you understand genetic mutations at all? Do you hear what you're saying? I didn't cause any damages, Dennis. Yeah, not to the exterior of my car, but to the interior of my car. My interior is ruined. Guys, so, I'm sitting at a red light, at a dead stop, and Frank rams into me. Out of nowhere! And now he's saying he's not gonna pay for the damages. I mean, did you know that the man cannot see? I can see! I got glasses. I just need new lenses. The lenses are what make the glasses work, Frank! If you were driving around without the use of sight, then that is completely irresponsible, and you need to pay for the damages. Yeah. None of the damages were my fault. Well, it sounds like all of the damages were your fault. I mean, Frank, how are we even talking about this? Yeah, if you rammed into He ran directly into somebody else. Dennis was eating a bowl of cereal. What? He was eating a bowl of cereal when I hit him, and it spilled all over the interior, and those are the only damages to the car. You were eating a bowl of cereal? Yes. While you were driving? Yes. It's not that crazy. That's not what this is about. Well, it's a little bit about that. Yeah, there's a high spill factor if you're driving Actually, it's a lot about that. Come on, I don't have to justify myself to you! You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna take you to court. Fine. Fine. Nobody needs to go to court here. There's no reason we can't settle this ourselves, like civilized adults. No, we can't, Dee, so I'm gonna take him to court, I'm gonna sue him, and I'm gonna win. Dennis, you don't want to go anywhere near a court. How many bench warrants for sexual misconduct do you have? I-I probably have yeah. Yeah. And, Frank, how many unregistered guns are in your car right now? A lot. Ooh, I like where you're headed with this, Dee, and, uh, if I may, I think what you're proposing is that we handle this little matter internally. Okay, uh, okay okay okay. I'd like to begin with my opening statement, uh, if I could. First off, uh, who is the defendant in this matter? That's not a statement. All right, well, irregardless, uh, I would like to know, as Frank's lawyer, who I am persecuting or who I'm defending. Yeah. Prosecuting. Okay, let me just nip this whole thing in the bud right now. Stop treating this like it's a trial, and like this is a courtroom. Yeah, but the tables. Yeah, but I was against that, too, okay? Let's just present the facts to each other, and then let's decide as a majority who's in the right. That being said, Frank would be the defendant. I'm not the defendant. No, that implies that I am guilty. He's right. If anyone's ever accused of anything, I automatically assume they're guilty. You do, right? I'm gonna make you the defendant. Okay, and I'll make Frank the defendant, and then we'll split it up after. You're the defendant. You aren't prosecuting him! I'm finished! I'm finished. Where have you been for the last three hours? I have been making this. What the hell is that? It's the Trial Meter. It shows how we each feel throughout the trial. Yeah, I made little gavels with our names on it, and we can move them accordingly. And at the end, whoever has the most gavels on their side wins. It took you three hours to make that? Yeah. Mac, let me tell you something. Nobody is gonna want to use that because it's so stupid. We are dealing with a serious issue here. You imbecile! Don't be an imbecile. Okay, my property is at stake. What are you doing? W-Well, don't do that. Look, okay, not that we're using this stupid thing, but don't start doing that because you're gonna I like what he did there. I'm gonna go ahead and move my guy. Why? Why? We haven't presented any facts yet. Yeah, okay. Well, don't everybody start moving their gavels over to the side, we haven't even well, good, at least you have the common sense to be on my side. Well, as your representative in this matter, I didn't have much of a choice. My hands were tied. N-N-No. No, no. You're not you're not my representative. I will be talking for myself. This is an open and shut case, and anybody who can't see that is a savage and an idiot! Okay, uh, I would like a five with my client, please. Oh, you want a five, counselor? I'd like to take a five, yes. All right, I'll allow it. Stop talking like this is a goddamn courtroom, please. Oh, I'm the judge! No, you're not. Can I be the bailiff? You are not anything! I'll allow it. No one is anything! I will scratch everybody's eyes out of their sockets! Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished collies, uh, my client Frank here isn't really on trial today, you know. Common sense is on trial. And, well, common sense would tell you that eating a bowl of cereal while operating a car is, well, it's-it's reckless. It's moronic. One might even call it donkey-brained. Donkey-brained? Uh, it means to have the brains of a donkey or a donkey-type creature. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think I know what it means, guy. But if anything, it's not donkey-brained to drive around with a bowl of cereal, it's donkey-brained to drive around without the use of your vision. Oh. That's interesting. So you do admit that someone who makes foolish decisions could be considered donkey-brained? Uh sure. Yeah, okay, fine. I'll take it. All right. Uh, now, Frank, if I'm correct, when you were a boy you were admitted into a mental institution. Is this correct? That's correct. But soon after, it was discovered that I wasn't mentally disabled, so they let me go. And, they let me go with the proper paperwork, clearing me of everything. I would like to add into evidence Article 1. Uh, Mac, will you please read this document? Mm-hmm. "By the power of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Reed Mental Institution hereby decrees Frank Reynolds to not have donkey brains." What? What? That is an official document that says "donkey brain" on it? Well, it's written right here in plain English. Frank, would you like to clear this up for everybody? Well all the kids in the neighborhood knew I got sent upstate, so they started calling me "Frankie Donkey Brains," and it was very traumatic. So I got my mommy to drive me back up to the loony bin, where they signed this official certificate exonerating me of all donkey brains. Yeah, great. What does this have to do with anything? Uh, well, Dennis, if by your own admission someone who has donkey brains could be considered reckless or moronic or idiotic, and my client Frank here has a state-issued certificate clearing him of having said donkey brains, then I ask you this: do you  have any such certificate? What? Well, we don't want a donkey on the road eating cereal. We know Frank's not a donkey. How do we know you're not a donkey-brained man? Why would I have a certificate? You don't have a certificate? N-N-No, the burden of proof is not on me. The defendant will answer the question. The defendant? I'm not the defendant! Just answer the question. No. No further questions. Oh! You got to be kidding be. Because of that?! You don't have a certificate. I mean, you know, what else are we supposed to What in the?! You may have donkey brains. I don't know. No one can prove that they're not donkey-brained except for him. I just I wish you had a certificate. Oh, bullshit! Frank would you like a glass of wine? Yeah, all right. Huh? Why not have a glass of wine? I mean, after all Oh! Hey! Hey! Hey! You can't do that! Oh, I'm so sorry. Oh, whoopsie, whoopsie. See, I bashed into Frank while he was at a dead stop. That's completely my fault, Frank. I will pay for all the damages to your shirt. Case closed. Oh, well, when you put it like that, you got me. You know, I'm on Dennis's side now-- he just convinced me. Uh, hold-hold on one second though, Charlie. It occurs to me that Frank assumed responsibility for a potential spill the second he took the wine. Yeah, he's right. I knew the risk. So in this circumstance, it would appear that Frank is at fault. And therefore in the car, Dennis is at fault. I am on Frank's side. Case closed. I pushed I mean, I pushed him! Boom! You nailed it. You know what? Mac just made the most credible argument of all. Hold on a second! Hold on, Charlie. Credibility? You're interested in credibility? I would like to call my next witness: Mac. So, Mac, you seem to be pretty locked into Frank's side at this point, right? And your opinion, it carries a lot of weight around here, doesn't it? Oh, absolutely. I'm a tastemaker around here. Pretty much what I say goes. And I've decided that Frank is the winner. Yeah. And, Charlie, you find Mac's arguments to be fairly credible and convincing? I do. Yeah, he makes a lot of good points. He's a good judge, and he's an even better bailiff. So if you find Mac's arguments to be so credible, why is it that you disagree on the subject of superhumans? But we don't What? What does this have to do with the case? Well, Mac, if your character isn't credible, then are your arguments? Strike this line of questioning from the record, please. Uh, overruled. Let her continue. Mac, do you or do you not believe that you could create a superhuman race of strongmen through genetic mutation and evolution? What difference does that make? If you believe something that insane, then how could you be our tastemaker? How could we believe anything that you have to say? I'm gonna ask you one more time: do you or do you not believe that you can create a superhuman race of strongmen through genetic mutation and evolution? Uh, no. That's ridiculous, Dee. What are you talking about? What are you talking about? You were just you were just telling Charlie this morning all about the "Oh, have you seen X-Men?" and "My seed," and Well, I was joking with Charlie. That could never happen in the real world, Dee. That's, like, a comic book thing. He's credible! He's credible. I win this case. It's an open and shut case. Shit, Dennis, that was Wait-wait-wait a minute. Mac, why don't you believe that? Huh? Well, I'm just wondering. Why don't you believe that you could pass down a gene that would eventually evolve into a race of supermen? Why? Well, that's a silly question. Because evolution doesn't exist, of course. I'm sorry? Oh, could you repeat that again for the room? Because evolution is bullshit-- it's not real. Goddamn it! Recess! What? What? What? What? You got to sway Charlie. You got to make yourself credible again. What did I do? We got to stop with this-- your insane, crazy beliefs. You got to tell them that you believe in evolution. Oh, come on, Frank. That's ridiculous. We got to get Charlie to stop thinking you're a lunatic. Look, Deandra's gonna side with Dennis-- that's a given. You want me to win? Okay, Frank, for you, I will make myself credible in Charlie's eyes again, so you can win. Just give me 15 minutes. I'm finished, guys! Jesus Christ. I'm finished. Now, this is all about making myself credible in your eyes again, and I'm gonna do that by admitting that evolution is a lie! God damn you, Mac! Yes, please do, Mac. Now, as you can see, this is the Evolution Meter. And I've put God, the creator of everything, on the right side. And evolution on the left. I went ahead and put you guys all on the fence, 'cause of course you're gonna Actually, no. Let's start where I would start. No matter. I'm righteous. I'm not gonna stand here, present some egghead scientific argument based on fact. I'm just a regular dude. I like to drink beer. You know, I love my family. Rock, flag, and eagle, right, Charlie? He's got a point. No, he doesn't. What? See, Charlie? These liberals are trying to assassinate my character. And I can't change their mind. I won't change my mind, 'cause I don't have to. 'Cause I'm an American. I won't change my mind on anything, regardless of the facts that are set out before me. I'm dug in, and I'll never change. Mac, look. You're wasting our time. You're not gonna get us to not believe in evolution. And why is that? Because the smartest scientists in the entire world all agree that it's real. I'm glad you brought that up, because, Mr. Reynolds, science is a liar sometimes. Oh, boy. This is Aristotle. Thought to be the smartest man on the planet. He believed that the Earth was the center of the universe, and everybody believed him, because he was so smart. Until another smartest guy came around, Galileo, and he disproved that theory, making Aristotle and everybody else on Earth look like a bitch. 'Course, Galileo then thought comets were an optical illusion, and there was no way that the moon could cause the ocean's tides. Everybody believed that because he was so smart. He was also wrong, making him and everyone else on Earth look like a bitch again. And then, best of all Sir Isaac Newton gets born, and blows everybody's nips off with his big brains. 'Course, he also thought he could turn metal into gold, and died eating mercury, making him yet another stupid bitch! Are you seeing a pattern? No. Mr. Reynolds, these were all the smartest scientists on the planet. Only problem is, they kept being wrong. Sometimes. This is insane, you fool. I'm a fool because I have more faith in the saints that wrote the Bible? Yeah, because you just read the words of a bunch of guys that you never met, and you just take it on faith that everything they wrote was true. Hm. And what makes you think what your scientists are writing is any more truer than my saints? Because there are volumes of proven data. Numbers. You know, figures. Th-There are fossil records. Oh, fossil records. Ah! I didn't even think about the fossil records. I guess I'll concede. Oh, wait, uh, one more thing before I do, Mr. Reynolds. Have you seen these fossil records? Have I huh? Have you pored through the data yourself? The numbers? The figures? Well, no. I'm-- no. Oh. Interesting. So let me get this straight, Mr. Reynolds. You get your information from a book written by men you've never met. And you take their words as truth, based on a willingness to believe, a desire to accept, a leap of of, dare I say it? Faith? Come on, come on. Look, I mean-- I don't even know how I'm supposed to respond to that. Like oh, come on. That is a that's a false equivalency. Just answer the question, Mr. Reynolds. Sure. Yeah, okay. I rest my case. Well, that got me. Frank, do you want to, uh Put me over. Yeah, all right. What? Well, we're going on the fence. I mean, that's a shadow of a doubt. You actually don't believe in evolution anymore? I don't know. He created a reasonable doubt. He makes you sound like a stupid, uh, science bitch. Yeah, he got you good. Eh oh, my God. Wait, wait, wait, wait. What-What are we even talking about? How did we get on evolution? This is not about evolution. Well, it became about that when you attacked Mac's character. Yeah, like they did in the O.J. trial to that hero cop, Mark Fuhrman. Right! Okay, let's just get back on track here. I would like to make my closing arguments. N-No, no, no, no, no. This has gone on long enough. And by the way, Dee, why the hell do you give a shit about any of this, anyway? You don't know? You can't think of why I might like to set a precedent of responsibility for when someone's car gets destroyed? No. Anybody else? Anybody? I I can't really think of anything. Can you think of anything? I'm blank. Not ringing a bell for me. You guys have destroyed every single car that I have ever owned! And we've never had so much as a conversation about it, much less a trial. A whole trial! Are you making that up? Isn't this What is she talking about? Are you sure that happened? Oh, you sons of bitches. Oh, you goddamn sons of bitches! I am going to destroy everything you own! Ooh. 'Kay, you know what? I'm gonna end this. I'm gonna end this! Oh! I still vote for Dennis. All right, well, I'm still for Frank. Yeah. And I am actually gonna go to the fence. What? God. Oh, goddamn it! We're nowhere with this. All right, okay, guys, settle down. I think if we've learned anything today, it's that, you know, we can't just take things based on faith. Only seeing is believing, right? Let's take this to the streets. Thanks, guys. Yeah, man. No worries. Have a good one. See you later. Have a nice day. Bye bye. Okay, here's the deal. Dennis, if you can drive to your apartment and back without spilling a single drop, Dee, your precedent is set, and Frank, you pay for everything. Fine. Good. Okay, and Frank, if you can drive to our place and back without getting in an accident with me giving you directions, you can continue to drive as long as I'm in the car with you. Deal! All right. On your mark. Get set. Go! Did he say it was a race? No. Why are they running? I have no idea. All right, steady. Steady as she goes. I'm going straight. Beautiful. No, beautiful stuff. This is the best. Yeah. Dee, uh, please prepare me a bowl of cereal. Yup. What are you doing? We got to see for ourselves how reckless this is. And you hold it in one hand and drive with the other. Interesting. Yeah, I know. Pretty mind-blowing stuff, isn't it? Then I stop at a stoplight, and, once I'm stopped, and everything is safe take a bite. All right, here we go. Hold on. Make a make a left right there. Make a what? Uh-huh. Go left. Make a left. Right. Right? No! Make up your mind! Deandra, shut up! Well, dude, now that we're alone, you can admit it. I mean, I swayed you on evolution a little bit, right? Well, I Ah! That's crazy! That is insane! How do you hit me again? It was Deandra's fault. What? She gave me the wrong directions. This way, that way! Guys, it was actually pretty cut and dried. It was Dee's fault. I was trying to give directions and she interrupted me. *** *** This is your fault? This is perfect. Guys, we were all here to witness it. It was Dee's fault, she'll pay for the damages. Absolutely. She should, yeah. That's it. Don't you dare. No, it was-- oh, you know, I have an idea. Should we have a trial? Me and Charlie?
 Kind of just had a trial.
 Too many trials. Can't have a trial for every person. Let's just have her pay for it and be done with this. All right, that's it. N-no, no, no! What are you-- no, because Charlie was giving the-- I was only-- Goddammit!                        Oh, there it is, Mac. There it is. I can't believe it's finally arrived. My God, Thundergun Express: The Unrated Director's Cut. 13 extra minutes of movie in this one. And it's unrated. They were not able to rate it. This is gonna be the best Thanksgiving ever. Oh, yeah, absolutely, man. Thundergun, hoagies and four extra seconds dedicated solely to the dong shot. Buddy, that's what I'm thankful for. So much better than a traditional Thanksgiving. Oh, yeah, dude, I hate Thanksgiving. What is that? What am I supposed to be thankful for exactly? Who am I meant to be thanking, right? I've had to scratch and claw for everything I've got. If anything, I should be thanking myself.
 Yeah.
 Hey, man. Welcome to Mahndo Video. How may we help you? What are you guys doing here? We own the store. We bought this bitch. We wanted to invest in an emerging market. An emerging market? Video stores are a dying market. This is, like, one of the only ones left. Then we're gonna corner that market. Okay. Whatever. Liam, what is on your eye? Someone ate my eye at my wedding. Don't you remember, man? The eyepatch is flesh-colored to make people less uncomfortable. I'm way more uncomfortable. Yeah, absolutely. You look like a man who was born without an eye, which is way creepier than a man who lost one. Just get a black eyepatch, you know? Embrace it. Losing an eye is badass. It's not badass. I have no depth perception! It's all your fault. What are you How is it our fault? What are you talking about? Let's not get into a whole thing about missing eyes and whose fault they are. You know, we'll just rent the video, and we'll be out of here. You are not renting shit. You are not welcome in this store. Your video-renting days are over! No, come on, don't do that, dude. Oh I-It's not even it's not even close. I mean, I Let me get that for you. Thanks, man. Don't cut don't Goddamn it. All right, look, just pay the man already. We'll be done with it. It's freezing in there. No can do, Charlie. It's the principle of the thing. You guys having a principle fight? No, we're not having a principle fight. We're having a heat fight, okay? 'Cause our heat's broken, and Hwang won't fix it until this guy pays the rent. This guy's not gonna pay the rent till Hwang fixes the heat. So you got one of those snafus, where you got old assholes It's a deadlock. It's a deadlock of butting heads. We got a disaster on our hands, a disaster. The McPoyles bought Mahndo Video. They revoked our membership. You didn't get Thundergun? We didn't get shit! Aw Hang on. Dee, why do our hoagies reek of gasoline? Maybe 'cause I got 'em at the gas station, I guess. Why? Why didn't you get the ones we like from the Wawa? Because Gail the Snail works at the Wawa, okay? And we got mad beef. She won't serve me. This is a mess. This is a mess. We can't get the sandwiches we want, we can't get the videos we want, my apartment's an icebox. Thanksgiving's gonna be ruined, you know. It's not just Thanksgiving, pal. You know what the real problem is? We have too many beefs all over town. It's jamming us up. We made a lot of enemies over the years. We have made enemies. We got to do something about this, guys, okay? So I say we use Thanksgiving as an opportunity to squash some of those beefs. All right, guys, this is really coming together. It's looking good. You know you know, this was the original meaning of Thanksgiving anyway. The Pilgrims and Indians had beef. So what did they do? They got together, they sat at a table, they ate some delicious food and they squashed that beef. And that's exactly what we're gonna do. Mac and I are gonna squash the McPoyle beef, you guys are gonna squash Hwang And you guys are gonna squash with Bruce. What? Say what? Bruce Mathis, I invited him. What?! What? What? Why would you do that? Because he is your dad, and Thanksgiving is a holiday for families. I also invited Charlie's mom, my mom and my dad, but they didn't want to come. So just Bruce? You know what, it's okay. We'll-we'll manage very carefully, and it'll be fine. Hey, maybe we can squeeze some money out of the guy. I'm-I'm confused though. In this whole scenario with the Pilgrim and the Indians, which one are we? The Pilgrims. They came out on top. I don't know about that, Frank. The Indians, they've got sports teams, they've got casinos. They're a very celebrated people. Yeah, that's true, actually. You don't see people walking around with the tall hat with a buckle on the front. Makes no difference though in our scenario with what we're trying to accomplish here, okay? They buried the hatchet. That's what they did, and that's what we're gonna do. Okay, so, to that end, here's the plan: once the guests arrive, we will ply them with liquor and then I will present to them this peace treaty that I will have them sign. Why do you always want people to sign creepy documents? Well, Frank, once something's in writing, that means it's set in stone. Then no one can do anything to stop me. When do you want me to serve the squash and the beef? S-So we're literally serving squash and beef? You said we're squashing beef. I thought it would be part of the ceremony to have squash and beef. Yeah, it's all about the ceremony. That's why I got this bucket of dirt and a hatchet, so we can have a ceremonial burying of the hatchet. Right. And after we do that, we're going to wipe the slate clean. Wait, no, guys, look, this is all very on the nose and totally
 unnecessary.
 Where's food? Walk right in, why don't you, Hwang? Thanksgiving, food. Yeah, Thanksgiving Thanksgiving, yeah, go sit down. Have a seat, have a seat, man! What do you live in, a barn? Have a seat, Hwang. Guys, listen, regroup, regroup. Let's put on some music, lighten the mood and get this party started. (Tom Tom Club's "Genius of Love" playing) Dee. Hmm? Go break the ice. What? Yeah. Why me? Yeah, yeah, someone's got to do it. Just go to go over there Go, go, go. S-Some good crackers. Huh? Mm. Mm. They are delicious. Yeah. What's wrong? Is it the eye? Why would I don't even know why you would say that-that. They made me feel self-conscious. Did they? Yeah. Is it off-putting? Or does it look real? The skin tone is a is a a good match. Oh, well, when you move the other one, I guess I can tell a little bit, if I'm being honest. Hey, turkeys, gobble, gobble. Cricket, what the hell are you doing here? Word around town is you guys are squashing beef. We don't have beef with you. You don't have beef with me? I was a priest before I got involved with you guys. Unbelievable. Look, we have enough on our plate right now, Crick. Come on, guys, let me stay. I-I'll eat the gristle. You can eat it off the floor like a dog, how 'bout that? Now you're just creating more beef. I don't mind. Woof, woof, baby. Great. Look at that. Beef squashed, huh? Okay, wait, wait, hold on a second. Here, sign this treaty. Mmm, yeah. It'll be official. Good. Boom, all right, get out of here. Go, go, go. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, let's get started. I really like your room, Mac. Thank you. Yeah, great. Have a seat, guys. Um, now, I Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, a little to the to your right. Okay, good. Now, I know we've had our differences in the past. Things have been a little tense between us. What is this? What is what? Standing. What's with the standing? You're lording. We're not lording, we're just having a conversation. Yeah, we're just Some kind of a status thing? A power move? Some kind of power play? Come on, guys. No. It's not a power move! We're having a conversation. There's one chair. Bring it down. Just bring it down on the haunches. You want us to squat? Haunch it. Arch down. Oh, Christ, fine. Just do it, just do it. All right, look Just do it. Give him the Guys, look, I know we've had our differences in the past. Things have been very, very awkward, but it's time for us to move forward with our relationship, all right? It's time to hit the reset button, wouldn't you say? Here's this. Open it up. Mm-hmm. It's your gift. What the hell is this? It's a peace treaty. We need you to sign that. I thought I was getting an
 eye.
 An eye? Why would you think that? You kept making comments. You were hinting about eyes. We're not giving you an eye! Where the Christ would we get an eye? And if we did get an eye, how would we attach it to you? I'm not signing shit until I get an eye. You owe me. Give him your eye. You want me to give him my eye? Mm-hmm. You realize how preposterous that is? Okay, then apologize. Apologize for what? For everything! For all of it! This isn't It's not about apology. We're not apologizing. We're not apologizing, okay? Nobody's apologizing. No one's admitting guilt or anything. We've all done something wrong. Okay, it's just about it's just about, like, you know, moving forward, moving on. Look, all you have to do is apologize, and I'll sign it. Give us a second. All right. How are we gonna get this eye? I don't know. Come on, come on, give me some. Eat the eat the you know, the skins if you got to eat something. I'll eat the skins. I'll always eat the skins. I love the skins. It's where all the vitamins are. What kind of meat is that, Charlie? Doesn't smell right. It's not grade A meat. You know, I'm not gonna get grade A meat. Just Why are you guys hovering? Don't hover. Answer the door! Get the door! All right. Yeah, all right! I'm gonna fight with you. What?! Snail, what the hell are you doing here? Who invited you? Dee, we invited her, okay? Enough is enough. You got to squash it with Snail, all right? We want to go to the Wawa again, all right? Goddamn it. Hey, you want some beef? You want some squash? You want to pack some beef? Listen, could you just swallow your spit and then breathe, and then we can talk? Then breathe, and close your mouth. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh, my God, it was sad for a second, and now it's right back to rah, making me do the See a doctor! Go see a doctor. All right, oh, let's just All right, hold on. Um Let's compromise. Is there something that we can do to just, you know, patch this up between you and Dee? I want her to be my best friend, yo. Oh, well, you know what? That's not gonna happen, so Yeah, that's too much. Okay Hang on, hang on, hang on. Is there a compromise? Is there anything? How about just for today? Just for today? Together. Okay, and then I get my convenience store to be convenient to me again, that's the deal? Word is bond, yo. Okay. Okay, yeah, that sounds good, let's do it. Yes, okay. All right, good. Frank, Hwang, you're up. Let's go. Okay. All right, well, somebody say something. These crackers need more salt. I agree. Okay, well they're extremely salty, but-but good. That's a start. I mean, you know, you guys agree about something. Hey! All right. My doctor say, no salt. Mine, too. Doctors are shit! Goddamn medicine men, trying to tell me how to eat my food. They're all shit. Well, look at that. You guys agree about something! Look at you two-- two extremely hardheaded, unhealthy old men who refuse to listen to doctors. Come on, you guys are, like Can we work this out? All right, Hwang, what if Frank gives you, like, half the rent now, then you fix the heat?! And then, he gives you the other half when the job's done? It's okay. Yeah? All right, that's a deal. That's a squashed beef. Frank, you. Oh, as a matter of fact I could give the whole month's rent right here. Well, that'd be good. I'll take it. Yeah, but I'm not gonna do it, because I'm not gonna let you beat me, because you're a lousy son of a bitch. You're a dog! I'm a dog, you're a dog, huh? Wt, wait, wait, wait. How's that? Huh? You're a fire dog! Plenty more where this came from. I could heat that apartment all winter, huh? You want it? Aah Yeah, yeah, yeah, fire dog. Aw! You're trying to burn me! Just give us an eye. You don't need both of them. I only have one good working eye. Yeah, but I think it might be better if you're blind anyway. You know, it's gonna heighten all your other senses. Let me think about it. I'll think about it. Okay, give it some thought. Give it some thought. I'll think about it. All right, well, we'll work that angle. All right, just Ooh, maybe that's Bruce. Oh, yeah. Hey, how'd you get him down here anyway? I told him that his kids wanted to see him for Thanksgiving, and that you guys wanted to be one big happy family again. Oh, nice. Hey. Who's this jabroni? I have no idea. Slam the door on his face. See you, bozo. Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait. Actually, I know who this guy is. Holy shit! Dude, this is the guy that Frank and Dee mistook for Bruce, and Frank got that bad intel, so they went to his apartment, instead of Bruce's apartment. And then we blew up his car. Blew the shit out of his car. Oh, my God. Wait a minute. That was you guys? Huh? No. I don't even know what you're talking about. Uh Happy Thanksgiving. Yeah, yeah. Wait, wait. Please. Are my kids in there? Somebody wrote me a note and said that my kids wanted to see me? I haven't seen 'em since my wife left me. Are they in here? Sabrina? Oh, this is bad. Yeah. Oh. Marco? Daddy's here. Oh, my God. We really opened up a can of worms. It's a bit messy. The good news is, seems that the kids thing took his mind off the car thing, so, maybe it'll work itself out. Okay, good. All right. Mac. Hey. Hey, thanks for calling, man. So, where are the kids? I can't wait to see those little rug rats. It's been forever. I'm sure they're around somewhere. Go ahead and mingle, and maybe you'll find 'em. My kids aren't really here, are they? Uh no. No. No, I lied about that. Thank God. Let's get shit-housed, right, guys? What a piece of shit that guy is. Yeah, he's a real piece of shit, yeah. Oh, my God. What the hell is Ponderosa doing here? Well, he's the one that's responsible for Liam's eye, so we figured, you know, he shows up, it shifts the blame from us to him, and, worst case scenario, they'll take his eye. Oh, my God, this is getting way too confusing. We got too many beefs. I can't keep up. God, Dee, we got it. Honk, honk, honk, honk, honk. Too many beefs, we got it. I'm not honking. I'm just I'm expressing something I'll admit it, it's getting confusing, there's a lot of people here. See? I'll take some of the blame for that. I did invite Let us take the lead. We got it, we got it. Okay. Can't get it to stay. There you go. Hi, uh, everybody, I'd like to say something, please. Uh, could I have your attention, please? I'd like to say something, yeah. Um, so, the Pilgrims hated the Indians and the Indians, they despised the Pilgrims. Yeah. But nonetheless, on Thanksgiving, they got together, right, and it wasn't about apologizing to each other. "Aw" It wasn't about admitting guilt. Won't do that. Okay? It was just about making the peace-- that was all that it was about. And if the Indians knew how to sign shit, they probably would've signed a peace treaty. Right? So that's what we're gonna do. We're gonna make peace with each other, and we're gonna get it in writing. All right? Is everybody amenable to that? Sound good? Great, uh, so we'd like to begin with Bill Ponderosa. Yes. It's not There's no need to clap. It's not a clapping event. No. Right. So Okay, so, um, Bill, do you have something you'd like to admit to someone here? Yes, actually, I do. Uh, I once broke into Dee's apartment and sniffed on her panties. What? Goddamn it! Beef! No, I got beef with that. Uh, can we, um Just stay on track. Um Bill, is there something you want to say to the McPoyles? Oh, um Hey, hey. I love that painted-on eye, man. That is fun. No. No, wait. No, no. Okay. No, no, no. All right, hey, hey, hey! Everybody stop clapping. All right, Liam, Bill's the one who put bath salts in the punch at your wedding, all right? He's the one who is responsible for your empty eyehole. Is this true, man? Maybe. I The only thing I remember from that night is my sponsor Frank giving me the green light to get shit-housed. That's true. That happened. I'll back that up. Then it's your fault. You owe my brother an eye! All right, settle down! Settle Take it easy, all right? Don't drag him into your beef 'cause I need him to focus on ours here. Hey, Frank, I'm giving this guy a handy under the table. Are you jealous? She's mashing it. She does that. I'm very aroused. Very good. Look, I'm-I'm sorry. Which one of you knows my ex-wife and when are my kids getting here? They'll get here. Just Who's this jabroni? Uh, this is the gentleman who we mistook for Bruce Mathis. Right, yep, and then we blew up his car. Don't say that! A-All of this, and it was you guys. You owe me a car. Whoa, easy, man! That's a big leap right there. Buddy, buddy, um, what's the deal with your kids? Y-You haven't see 'em in a while. Did you do something? Is it Was it your fault? Oh. I have a horrible drug problem. Ooh, I hear you. I know that game, huh? You want to do a bump here? Yeah, of course I want a bump. I'll have a few of those delicious nose clams. Frank, no, come on. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't clap for that! What? I can't have squash? I can't have blow? We need you to focus! Sign the damn treaty! All right, you know what, Hwang, you sign the treaty. I'll sign it. Oh, gross! Don't touch me with that hand! Put your hand over here. I'll take sloppy seconds. Absolutely not. Mash me, baby. Mash me. No mashing at the table! Stop mashing, all right? Come on. Goddamn it, Frank, I'm starting to think I have beef with you! Yeah, us, too! Okay, I have an idea. It's time now to wipe the slate clean. No, you said we were gonna do the hatchet thing first! Don't worry about the hatchet thing, okay? That was an unsanctioned move. Well, none of these moves are working! We got to do something else! Food fight! Food fight! I guess! What?! No! Sign the treaty! You owe me an eye, Frank! Oh, shit. No, no, no, no. Uh, this was a bad idea. We stirred up too much conflict. Yeah. It smells like smoke. Is something burning? I think it's coming from your room, dude. What?! My room's on fire. Why is my room on fire? I may have started a money fire. Why would you start a fire in my room, Frank? I don't know, I don't know. We got to think, we got to think. Think, think. I've got an idea. So we're just gonna lock them in there? They're definitely gonna burn to death. Okay, guys, nobody's gonna burn, all right? There's a fire escape. We'll call 911. We just need to buy a little time so we can get the hell out of here. I feel like we're just creating more beef. Which we will not resolve. Beefs are best left simmering under the surface-- I've learned that now. The best thing to do with a beef is jam it deep down inside and then press forward. What are we gonna do now? You know, we could just buy Thundergun and go to a different Wawa. Yeah, it's a little inconvenient, but it's better than facing our problems. Yeah, or saying we're sorry, which I'm not doing. Hell, no, I don't do that. All right, you want to go back to my place, get some blankets, bundle up? Just us? No one else? That's what I'm thankful for. We don't need to get along with anybody else-- we got each other. Yeah, screw everybody else. I hate people who are different than me, you know? Why pretend? (inside There's a fire escape right here. Fire escape. Out the window. Who's got me? Man down. I right back here, guys. Who's got me? Guys? Hello? Hello?                        Happy New Year 2016
 New Year, New Color ;-) Oh, yeah. These are going down real smooth now. Dee, slow down. You're on pace to drink 130 beers. Don't ruin this for me, Deandra. This could be the last chance I got to do something great in my life. You jerks are just all mad 'cause I'm gonna be the one to shatter Boss Hogg's drinking record. Dee, Boss Hogg was a big, fat redneck from The Dukes of Hazzard. Wade Boggs is a Hall of Fame third baseman. Yeah, it's Wade Boggs's drinking record, okay? The man's a legend. He drank 50 beers on a cross-country flight and then absolutely destroyed the Seattle Mariners the next day, okay?
 Ugh.
 That's why we're doing this, to honor his memory, okay? May he rest in peace. First off, Wade Boggs is very much alive. Secondly, the number of beers is actually highly disputed. Some say 50, some teammates said 60 some said as many as 70 beers. Which, to be honest, is an absolutely insane amount of beer.
 Nobody can drink that much.
 Not with an attitude like that. Perhaps we're taking this a little bit too seriously? Absolute We're not, okay? The man is a legend. That's why we're doing this, all right? To honor his memory.
 Rest in peace, Wade.
 Again, he is still alive. Always sticking me with the nerds.
 Yes, ma'am?
 Uh, actually, I can, uh, handle this one. We'll be sharing the in-flight call system today.
 Excuse me?
 Oh, sorry. Let me explain. We're doing a Wade Boggs-type thing and that makes me sort of the Commissioner Bud Selig of the group. Oh, you're the commissioner now? Well, somebody's gotta keep the game fair And everybody invested, okay, Dee? He didn't win the chugging contest. Two more beers, please. Actually, ma'am, we're about to take off
 so I'm gonna need you to stow your tray table.
 Ooh.
 Okay.
 I can take that and throw it out for you. Yeah, but just give me a second. Okay? Just give me a second?
 There you go.
 Great. Hold on. Hold on. Ugh! Ouch! It's really cold. Damn, Dee. Oh, God. You really have to slow down a little bit. Can I get you something to drink? Hey, I'll just get a beer, please.
 Thanks.
 Mm-hmm. I'm a little concerned about this frat boy here.
 There's only so many beers on the flight.
 I'll take care of him.
 For you, sir?
 Excuse me, miss? Um, actually, yeah. How many beers are we allowed to order at once? I'm not sure. No one has ever asked that before. Great, so there's no rule on that. Uh, why don't you give me six then, please? How about you make it an even dozen? How about I start you with two apiece, and we just take it from there? Sure, if you want to be lugging beers back and forth the entire flight. I guess that's, uh, up to you. I'll be taking care of everybody on the Boggs account. Oh, and by the way, do you sell condoms? No, I'm afraid we don't.
 Ooh.
 Yeah. I'll have to figure something else out.
 Got it.
 Thank you so much.
 Hey. Frank.
 Hmm? What's with the condom thing? You think the Boggs record is the only one I'm going for? I'm gonna become the first-ever member of the Air Sex Society. Okay. What is that? That means I'm gonna be plowing somebody in the bathroom before this plane lands. Do you think you made that up? Because that's already a thing. It's called the Mile High Club. People have been doing it since planes have been around. That name sucks. I'll tell you what though. I will make you a bet that I plow somebody on this fight somewhere other than the bathroom, before we hit the Great Lakes.
 I'll take that bet.
 Yeah? Whoa, whoa. Did I hear you guys talking about a bet? There's no betting, okay? That compromises the integrity of the game. It's got nothing to do with the Wade Boggs thing. It doesn't matter, okay, guys? That's a rule. And as commissioner, you have to obey me. Right, Commissioner. Go get me another beer. Okay, I will, but not because you told me to but because I'm commissioner and that's my job. Yeah. You're on. Pathetic. Twenty nine beers.
 How can I help you?
 Hmm? Oh. Hey-oh!
 This is my guy.
 Yeah.
 I got a couple more for you. Grab that.
 Great. Actually, while you're here could I have a rum and Coke, please? Uh, oh, uh, hold on one second. It's a beer-drinking contest, Charlie. I'm still doing the Boggs thing, but you know what? A stiff cocktail would go good with my chicken, so Why are you filling up with chicken? Do you know anything about Wade Boggs? The man ate a chicken before every game. That's why they called him "the Chicken Man." Man batted.328 lifetime. I'm sure he ate some rum and Cokes too, all right? You just said "ate rum and Cokes." You're getting buzzed.
 You shouldn't be drinking hard alcohol.
 I said one rum and Coke. One, please. Make it a double though. Hey-oh! Mama needs another pop, pop.
 Pop-de-pop, soda pop, soda pop, soda pop, soda pop
 What are you doing?
 Why are you dancing around like a jackass?
 Soda pop, nah. Wade Boggs would roll in his grave if he could see your behavior.
 Wade Boggs is alive.
 Huh? He lives in Tampa, Florida. He's in his early 50s. You, where did you come from? You were passed out two minutes ago. I know it, I was, and then I popped a couple of these babies. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
 What the hell are those, Dee?
 Greenies. Uppers. Feel like I got a rocket up my ass. If these guys find out that you're taking performance-enhancing drugs the integrity of the game is completely compromised, all right? Oh, shit. As the Bud Selig of the group it's my job to quietly sweep this under the rug before anybody finds out.
 You know, Commissioner, you just
 Go.
 Lost the chugging contest.
 Go. Hey! You know, I actually went to school at the same college, your alma mater, in 1966.
 Yeah?
 Yeah, here, have a beer, huh?
 It's like
 Oh, that's nice of you. Yeah, yeah, good, yeah. Drink up. Frank? Did you just buy frat boy a beer? Don't worry about it. I laced it with sleeping pills. He's gonna be out like a light in two minutes. That is some diabolical shit, dude. Down. What's going on with the sex moves? I've been laying chum up and down this plane. Yeah, I-I know. I've noticed. Yeah, I've got my prey picked out. I'm just waiting for the right moment to pounce. What are you talking about? You haven't moved an inch. You're just drinking.
 Oh, is that what you think?
 Mm-hmm. Frank, of the 206 passengers on this flight is a suitable candidate Notice how she glances forlornly at the empty seat next to her. It was meant for someone special. And the tan line on her ring finger suggests the wound is still fresh, leaving her vulnerable. Furthermore, when we hit turbulence earlier, she giggled telling me she's a bit of a thrill seeker. You think she offed the guy and went on the run? Pretty tough to lay low in a dress like that. Granted, it's not a particularly remarkable garment. It's from the J. Crew Spring 2012 collection. Although, it is a bit much for an airplane. Furthermore, if she were standing, you'd notice she's got no panty line giving me about five extra seconds to enter her swiftly before she realizes I am not the answer to her problems. I'll tell you my tastes lie a little bit more in 39F. No. No, thank you, Frank. No, her blouse is covered in cigarette burns. And I imagine underneath that blouse, you'll find copious amounts of road rash probably sustained in some sort of off-roading accident which would also explain her limp. Although something tells me the two are unrelated. Either way, she's North Dakota trash through and through and far beneath a gentleman such as myself. Uh, miss? Six more beers. Oh. Hey-oh! Ah, there we go.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Hey, listen, Charlie?
 Yeah. I need you to start a McGwire/Sosa-like rivalry with Dee. Look, I think you're getting, like, too worked up about this thing. Can we just drink the beer and hang out? Here's the thing. The game seems to be getting off the rails. Frank and Dennis are super distracted and Dee is kind of running away with it. Boggsy didn't drink six gallons of beer because he was obsessed with, like, breaking some record. You know what I mean? He did it 'cause he was just, like, thirsty, you know and looking to pass the time. Yeah, but I can sell a rivalry, all right? What I can't sell is 27 beers. What am I gonna do with 27 beers? Who-Who cares about 27 beers? We're not selling anything. Like, I think you're taking the commissioner thing way
 You lost the chugging contest.
 Why did you make me Bud Selig if you didn't Nobody did. You just started saying that. Look, I got empties for you.
 Take those and don't put pressure on yourself
 I got the empties. Listen. Attention, passengers. This is your captain, Boss Hogg, speaking. And this cold slice of heaven is my 40th beer of the afternoon. So any of you dick-nips think you can slug it down faster than me you're welcome to get your fat asses up here to try.
 Mm-mmm.
 Yeah. No.
 Mm-mmm! Mm-mmm!
 Put your
 Oh, I'm gonna need that.
 Ah.
 You ruining everything.
 Okay. The Boggs group is cut off.
 Oh.
 What? Aw, dude. That's not good. I can't stop drinking now.
 I'll probably die, dude.
 Damn it! I'm running low too. Shit. Okay. Luckily, I came prepared.
 Oh, yeah?
 Yeah. Charlie, we're not on a wide-body DC-10 for nothing. Right. We bought tickets. Well, yes, but we chose a wide-body DC-10 on purpose.
 That's what I'm
 To get up in the sky. Let me walk you through it. I got 100 extra beers in a checked bag, okay? Now according to movies like Executive Decision and Passenger 57 there is a secret hatch on every plane
 that allows me to travel freely throughout the aircraft.
 Everybody knows that. Yeah, so I just gotta find my right time to get down there.
 I think you can probably go anytime.
 Go right now, right?
 This stewardess is not on the ball.
 Okay, yeah.
 Oh!
 Hey-oh!
 Why isn't the door locked, Frank?
 I'm posting up. Half the battle is getting them to follow you to the bathroom. This way, I'm sitting here. It's like lambs to the slaughter. Aaah! What's happening to me? Some-Something is wrong.

 Ladies and gentlemen, if there's a doctor on board please press your call button. Something is wrong with me. Dude, how many sleeping pills did you give that kid?
 I don't know? Seven, 12?
 Twelve?
 Yeah! You told me to take care of him.
 I didn't tell you to kill him. You better do something. Otherwise they're gonna have to make an emergency landing and this thing's gonna be screwed! Ah, shit! Uh, what seems to be the problem here? Are you a doctor? Mantis Toboggan, MD. You want this young man to live, you're gonna have to give me some aspirin a roll of duct tape, a bag of peanuts and four beers. Jackpot. All right, this way. Shh. Nice. All right, here we go.
 Speed it up a little bit, hon?
 Okay.
 Ooh. Wow!
 Ooh-hoo-hoo. Yeah! Ugh. Oh, you really know your way around. If I've learned anything from films like Executive Decision or Passenger 57 there's always a way into the cargo hold.
 You're weird.
 You have no idea.
 Oh.
 Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Nothing with my lips, all right?
 Okay.
 I don't want to do that with you.
 Mind if I take a pill?
 Yeah, sure, take a pill. All right, well, that's happening. Now just do that. That's a boy! Is it really necessary to restrain him like this? You can never be too careful with altitude sickness. One time, this broad chewed through the fuselage of a 747. Luckily, I'm a pilot too. I inverted the bird and landed her safely in an open field.
 Ah.
 Okay, I'm sorry. I'm gonna need to see some identification. You don't think I'm a pilot? I don't think you're a doctor. That is a serious accusation. You've had 14 beers.
 You don't know that.
 It's written on your shirt. How'd you like to go to the bathroom with me?
 I gotta go.
 You and me? Well, Frank I have single-handedly pushed the limits of high-altitude eroticism.
 You banged her?
 Yeah.
 What happened to the classy broad?
 Oh, happily married. Yeah. Turns out she takes her ring off when she flies 'cause her fingers swell. Yeah. But it-it's all good, Frank. You know, hey, turns out Boggs he didn't hit it out of the park every time at bat.
 Mm-hmm.
 He tried to get the ball in play and hope that he could squeak it through the hole. I just squeaked it through multiple holes, if you know what I'm saying. Don't, you! Ladies and gentlemen, please fasten your seat belts as we begin our initial descent into North Dakota. Oh, shit. Well, you know, you heard the captain.
 On your bike.
 I wish I could just sit with you. Yeah. Hmm.
 But, you know, there's already a guy in the seat, so
 Oh. Excuse me, Mr. Person would you mind switching seats so I could sit with my boyfriend? Thank you. Hello, Charlie. Oh, shit! You're the ghost of Wade Boggs! I'm not a ghost, Charlie. You're just hallucinating. You've had over 30 beers, dude! Uh, you did? Nice, man.
 You know, your friend Mac is right.
 Oh, yeah?
 I didn't win five batting titles because it was fun.
 Right. I won it because I wanted to be the best.
 Do you see what I'm saying?
 Nah, not really, man. There's nothing more fun than winning. So, come on, drink up.
 All right.
 I'll have one with you.
 Nice! Let's do it, Boggs.
 Yeah. All right.
 Let's drink!
 Cheers! Howdy, Dee. Well, what do you say, Boss? Now, I know you're not quitting on me. I need you to keep drinking those beers so you can help me stop them Duke boys from spoiling all my crooked Hazzard County schemes! You got it, Boss Hoss. All right! Well, here we are, beautiful North Dakota. Hope you brought a coat 'cause it looks cold as shit out there. I don't live in North Dakota. You're going to LA? About 200 miles inland, the Salton Sea. My family has a tilapia farm there. Goddamn. Good. Good for them.
 Will you excuse me for a minute?
 Sure. Dennis. Dennis!
 Huh?
 Where you going? Oh, I mistook that girl for Great Plains trash. She's actually desert trash. I should've picked up on the multiple gecko tattoos so this is kind of on me. Either way, I'd rather stay in this barren wasteland of a state than spend one more minute with that filth.
 I'll see you back in Philly.
 Wait, wait, Dennis. Don't go. Now you can go. Come on! Drink! You can do it! You guys are gonna make it! I can't believe what we are witnessing here. We are making history here, people! We're making history!
 Beer me, baby.
 You're 40 beers back, bitch! Just sit back and enjoy the show. Well, I'm tired of people telling me what I can't do. They say I can't drink on a plane. They say I can't bang on a plane. They say I can't be a pilot. I can't be a doctor. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it right in front of your face. I'm gonna chug 15 beers right now. Oh, that's so cold. Beer's so cold. There's a There's a Instant rebuff. Just leave me here. Okay, guys, here we go. Almost there! Almost there! Wake up! Perk up! Perk up! Guys, we're at 70 beers. That means one more to break the record.
 Come on.
 Come on. You can do it! Go! Chug it! Chug it! Come on, come on, you can do it. You can do it! I believe in you!
 Yeah!
 Yeah, Dee, go!
 I did it!
 Seventy-one beers!
 Holy shit!
 I'm the king, Boss Hoss.
 But you're not done yet.
 Ah. Yeah, no. Uh, Boggs didn't just drink enough beer to kill a horse. He also suited up the next day and went three for five so you're gonna have to do that. Yeah, totally. All right, uh Where's Dee? What? Okay, here we go, Charlie. You gotta go at least three for 10, all right? You ready? I'm gonna put a little mustard on this one, all right? All right. Holy shit, dude! You roped that!
 Wow!
 All right, give me another one. That's the only ball I have, and I didn't expect you to hit it that far. I don't feel like going to get it. So, I'm the commissioner. I say you did it! Yeah! One for one. That's batting a thousand, dude. Yeah!
 Whoo!
 Nice work! Yeah!
 Hey, man?
 Yeah?
 It's kind of gloomy, huh?
 Yeah. If we hurry up, we get back to the airport, get a red-eye back to Philly. They got chicken, yeah!
 Let's go grab a beer.
 Ah, yeah. Happy New Year 2016
 New Year, New Color ;-)                        Happy New Year 2016
 New Year, New Color ;-) You have a boyfriend? I have a boyfriend. Is it that hard to believe? I got a boyfriend. His name's Ryan.
 How the hell did you get a boyfriend?
 I met him on Bunchers. Right, so you went on a group date with ugly chicks to make yourself look good and tricked a guy. Yes, of course. That's exactly what I did. And it worked well. And-And now we're going steady.
 That's a good trick.
 Bunchers sounds like the '70s. Bunch of people would get together. Next thing you know, it was all asses and hands and tits and I could slip right in and out without anybody noticing. It was great. I can definitely brush up on my game. I don't know if you guys have noticed this, but, like I'm kind of having a hard time closing the deal with the waitress.
 I-I-Is he
 Yeah, we've noticed. Maybe I can go on some group dates with you, and you can show me some skills and I can figure out the final move that I need to Oh, let's do them at Paddy's. We could make a bunch of money.
 That's a good idea.
 We can make a bunch of money. I'll tell you what, as an erotic man I have been keeping my eye on this Bunchers situation and I gotta say I'm into it. I'll tell you what. I will take you two under my wing and show you the DENNIS system in action. Sounds great. I, myself, am all tied down, so I can't participate. But, uh, I think it'd be great to jump in on this trend.
 Mm-hmm.
 All right. Here's to orgies.
 I'm, like, sweating through my pants.
 Yeah.
 Do you want some cheese?
 You brought cheese?
 Yeah, need some?
 Yeah. Let me see that. Right? Focus up, guys. Come on. The girls are gonna be here soon. Cheese. Right. Why do you have a dog leash? Oh. Good question. Yeah. It's for the first "D" in the DENNIS system. See, the girls will see the leash, and I'll say, "I've got a rescue dog outside" thereby, "D," demonstrating my value as a compassionate man.
 Right.
 Later, when we go outside, the dog will be missing. I'll become hysterical and suggest that maybe the dog ran back to the apartment. We'll go back to the apartment. The dog won't be there either, and the girl will console me.
 With sex.
 Oh!
 What happened to the dog?
 He let it go. It probably got obliterated by a taxi or something.
 Bet that's what happened. Shit. Poor thing.
 No, no, no. There never was a dog.
 Oh, my God!
 Wait, wait, wait.
 There was no dog?
 Wait, I am totally lost here.
 It's a made-up scenario Follow my lead.
 I thought you got a dog. Hey. Mac, Charlie and Dennis?
 Yes! Hi.
 Good evening, ladies.
 Hi, baby.
 What the hell?
 Thanks.
 All right. Oh, I am gonna make a shitload of cash tonight, which is good because I just dropped a whole bunch of money on a new promise ring for my man. Oh, you're proposing? Good. Smart. Corral him, because God knows he'll never ask you. No, I'm not proposing. I'm promising my fidelity in our new relationship. I deactivated my Bunchers account and I changed my Facebook status to "in a relationship." Why would you do that? I told you. 'Cause we're going steady. He's my main squeeze. You sound like a 12-year-old. It's a total turnoff. My cock ring is sliding off. Why my father is talking to me with a cinch around his penis is beyond my grasp. You gotta be ready for when the orgy breaks out. Oh, shit. It fell off.
 Oh!
 Help me find it. What, this guy? Oh, well, he His name's Henry.
 He's a dog.
 He's a dog. Uh, yeah. Named him after my grandfather, who I'm very, very close to. No, Henry's a great little guy. I tell ya, when I snuggle up next to him on the couch, I'd swear that He was the one who rescued me.
 Oh, that's so sweet.
 Oh, God. The waitress got bit by a chow once, and I kicked the shit out of the thing.
 You kicked a dog?
 Yeah.
 Well, you know, for the waitress.
 Who's the waitress?
 Nobody, nobody.
 Oh, I'm sorry. No. Nobody? She's the woman I'm in love with, you know? I follow her around a lot. She doesn't really give me the time of day. That's cool though, 'cause I'm not gonna give up on her. You don't give up on something that beautiful.
 All right.
 She's not beautiful. Everybody's banged her, except for me. She was like, "I want to do hand stuff," and I was like, "You're gross."
 Keep this up. See what happens.
 Yeah, what are you gonna do?
 I will strike you down.
 Okay.
 I will strike you down!
 You're gonna strike me down? Hang on. See? That's a
 That's our thing.
 They're doing a bit. Sorry, that was a joke.
 You wanna do something fun?
 Yeah.
 I do, I do.
 Yeah.
 Let's mix up the seating arrangement.
 We'll mix up the seating. Kim, I'm detecting a little bit of a vibe from you
 so why don't you come sit where he's sitting?
 I'll move!
 You sit where she's sitting.
 I'll stay here. No, you're gonna switch places with Becky. Right? Because while I don't particularly find you conventionally attractive I do find you oddly sexy. Excuse me? That was a compliment. Um, sorry, that came out weird. Excuse me. You guys work here, right?
 Yeah.
 Can I get a drink? Y Go ask one of the other ones.
 What other ones?
 The other ones the bird lady, the-the troll man.
 Ask them for a drink. We're on a date.
 Are you touching my leg? Ah, he's engaging you physically.
 Don't label it.
 You were supposed to want that because he was supposed to tell the dog story to demonstrate his value, and I botched it.
 He has a system for women.
 W-Well, don't talk about the system. The system happens without them knowing it.
 There is no system.
 Yeah, yeah.
 And there is no dog.
 The system is not a thing. The dog is a thing. Uh, guys. Let's, um Let's talk about something fun, that's fun for me. Don't move away from me. What You're moving closer to men who eat trash or bang transsexuals? Move close to me! Ryan? Hi!
 How are you?
 Dee! Oh, hey, what's up? Are you surprising me at work, you stinker? I love that! You're so cute. Guess what. I got you a little surprise too. Yeah. I didn't know you worked here. It's so strange. Um, yeah, I'm actually on a Buncher.
 Wait. What?
 Yeah, they should be here any minute. It was good seeing you.
 Oh.
 What do you got? What's in the box? No, that That's just a It's a cock ring.
 It's a cock ring, just from all my lovers.
 Oh.
 It's kind of small, huh?
 Well, it's my dad's. So Huh. Weird.
 I'm breaking up with you.
 Right. Well, I didn't know that we were together. Look, can I get a beer? We killed it, boys. We killed it. This was a great idea. Yeah, but the date sucked. No, I think the date went pretty well for me. It did suck for you guys though. Those girls are probably at their apartments right now trying to figure out how to get in touch with me. Unbelievable. Goddamn son of a bitch. Buy you a promise ring, you're out flitting around, dating other people? I shouldn't have given this guy a five-star rating. He didn't deserve it, and then he used it against me! What's this now? You're rating people? Yeah, it's that site, Raters. Girls can rate guys they go on dates with. They rate them? Like
 What do you mean? A star rating or something?
 Yeah. I'm gonna take that guy's five-star rating, I'm gonna give him a zero.
 Hey, wait a second.
 Hang on a second. Are we rated on there? Yep.
 Ah!
 We are?
 What?
 Holy shit. Let me see. Oh! Wait. One star? Out of five?
 Yep, yep.
 No, no. Oh, shit! Me and Charlie got two stars! Oh! Nice! We're better than you, dude! That's bullshit. No, no. The only reason I was rated one star is 'cause I was brought down by you two morons, all right? I was a five-star man before the Internet and I'm damn sure a five-star man now. I just gotta drop the dead weight so I can shine. Goddamn it. Goddamn it! He's out, I'm in. Let's swing. Oh, this poor jerk has no idea. He's about to get played like a goddamn guitar.
 Only one guy?
 Yeah. I'm doing Sparkers now. Isn't that what you're doing? You got rid of Mac and Charlie. Yeah, no, I did, but I still want three girls, you know?
 I like having the options.
 Yeah. I'll make some shit up about where the other guys are.
 Can I get a drink, please?
 Not now. Ask one of the other ones.
 Yeah.
 The dirty one or the gay one. Frank, why do we have to be in here? We should be out there, gettin' our swings in, dude. Because we're not ready. We need a game plan. We can't risk losing our two-star rating.
 That's a good point.
 Right.
 Don't want to lose any stars.
 Okay. A good date is all about conversation. If we could master some pleasant banter and then punctuate it with a joke, we'd be in good shape.
 Sounds easy enough.
 Yeah, all right. We can do that. Okay, all right. What are some of the things we could talk about?
 Ah. Creatine shits.
 Creatine shits? Yeah. Oh, creatine is a workout supplement. It shows that I care about my body. What's shitting it out got to do with anything? Oh, well, that demonstrates an inside knowledge of the product. It shows that I'm not just mentioning it, I actually use it. No. I think we should avoid talking about muscles and men's bodies and shits. I mean, it sends the wrong message. We should also avoid talking about the waitress, Charlie. Why? It's, like, a super romantic thing to talk about. It's a love story for the ages. Yeah, I think you should actually bring it up. Also, who's gonna say grace? We should figure that out now. Wait, wait, okay. Listen. Maybe we should concentrate on stuff not to talk about. So, what, you're, like, a chiropractor or some shit?
 A spinal surgeon actually.
 Cool. Yeah, cool. Oh, what, this? Henry. Henry the dog. He's lost. Probably dead. Look, let's cut to the chase. I like you. I like you very much. This is gonna happen. Cheers.
 Whoa! That's strong.
 Mmm. I'm not much of a drinker. No? I'll get two more. Hey. Hi.
 Hi.
 Hi. So, um, where are the other guys? Oh, yeah, it's Fair enough. The other guys got tied up. They couldn't make it. But, uh, fortunately, I possess all of their good qualities. All right.
 Ladies, these things can be a little bit awkward, right?
 Yes.
 What do you say we do some shots?
 Yes, please.
 Please.
 Yeah, let's do it. Oh! What is that? What are you doing? Are you rating me? No. No, I'm just checking my phone. Oh. That's cool. Cool. If you were to rate me, what would you put?
 I don't know. I
 Oh. You can't not know, right? That's stupid. It's simple. It's one out of five. If it were a one-out-of-five thing, and it is, what would you give me? The obvious five-star rating, or would you be a liar? Can we stop talking about ratings? Yeah. Of course we can. That's stupid. Why would we even Yeah. Oh! I have a rescue dog outside.
 Okay.
 That was jarring. There was no context for that. Sorry, sorry. I'm just Sorry. My rhythm's a little bit is a little bit off. I'm thrown because I-I kind of want to just Can we just get the rating thing out of the way? I feel like it's a thing now. What's going on here, dude? Were there really other guys? Of course there were. I don't like the way you asked that.
 Switch with her.
 Oh, my God. You know what? I think we're gonna go. Okay, fine. Then I don't want you to rate me.
 That's not what I want anymore.
 I was never going to rate you.
 But now I definitely am.
 Oh.
 How many stars?
 Oh, my God! God. Looks like the spider caught herself a fly. Uh, we can't talk about snakes or smells? What else is there?
 Uh, can you put Jews in the "yes" column?
 What? We gotta get it out in the open.
 Leave the Jews out of it.
 No, because they have their "J" sites. They don't wanna be with us as much as we don't wanna be with them.
 I don't support any of that.
 No, no, that-that-that I'm concerned the person I'm gonna be dating killed the savior of the world.
 That's all! That's all I'm concerned about!
 Put religion in the "no."
 Let's switch gears and go to the joke.
 Yeah. Oh, oh! I got a great one about a dago fisherman. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Ethnic jokes are really dicey. You can't do that. You gotta keep it light. Like, uh, a cowboy and a teacher walk into a bar. Yeah, but that doesn't make sense, 'cause cowboys hate teachers. Cowboys are independent thinkers who like to learn for themselves. All right, look. I think we're gettin' bogged down here. Why don't we just go out and do a dry run with some broads and see how we do on our feet? Okay, but what about our stars? I mean If things go wrong, I'll blow this whistle and call the date before they have a chance to get to know us. Mmm. Let's just keep it simple. Let's just start with our names. Hi, ladies. I'm Frack. Shit. Now I'm a half a star? Half a star? How does a five-star man get a You know what? It's these group dates. That's what's doing it. There's just too many variables. The girls feel too safe. I gotta get 'em in a one-on-one scenario.
 Sorry. I've gotta get to work at the hospital.
 The hospital. Do you? Yeah. I've never had a one-night stand before.
 Mmm, mmm.
 I hope this isn't that. Oh, no! I'm gonna call you. Okay. Call you one star, bitch. Ha!
 Pass me that computer.
 What are you doing? One star?
 That guy was awesome.
 Hmm.
 Is he a doctor?
 Yeah, he was a doctor and super hot. This feels good. Okay, you know what? You're a heartless pig. That's what's happening. You lead a man on, have sex with him and throw him in the trash? You've been doing that to women for years. Yes, but I don't rate them online for everyone to see.
 Don't all your sex tapes have star ratings?
 Yeah, but that's different. That doesn't go on the Internet. That's just for me. And Mac. And Charlie. Okay. You know what? It doesn't matter. It's my turn. This is my time. It's Dee's time. I even have my own system. The DEE system. Do them. Establish low rating. Increase power. Increase is spelled with an "I." Okay, well, then, uh, infuriate them when they find out
 Another "I."
 Empower! It doesn't The word doesn't matter. It's-It's the system Ah, I don't care about you. You know what? This is the problem, Dee. You can't even spell, much less come up with a decent system. And now your slapdash opinions are gonna be thrown across the Internet for everyone to see. You know, these ratings, they follow a man around. They're gonna ruin this man's reputation. Well, sucks to be him. But the thing about a rating is you don't know the quality of the person who's giving the rating, right? I mean, for instance, some dum-dum goes into a Morton's Steakhouse. She orders a steak well-done and then complains when the damn thing comes out too dry. Well, it's like, "Hey, dum-dum, you ordered the damn thing well-done. That's why it's dry, you stupid idiot." Not bad, a little stiff. Got tripped up on the conversation portion
 but we're improving.
 Mm-hmm.
 Hey.
 Oh, hey. How'd your date go? Uh, not great. She ditched me. Yeah, this rating thing It's messing with my head. It's throwing my game off. I think I need to target some more undesirable women. You know? Pick up some easy stars. I think that'll get me out of this funk.
 We made it past introductions.
 Oh, yeah? Yeah, and Wow, check out Dee, man. She's killing it!
 She's got it down!
 Forget her!
 Let's get back on the horse.
 All right. Come on.
 So you guys own this bar?
 Officially, yes. Unofficially, we're so much more.
 I like to think of us as mercenaries, a strike force
 Frank's management. I'm security. Charlie bashes rats. I don't really bash 'em so much as drown them these days so I don't have to listen to their screams. He's a five-star dog 'cause I wouldn't rescue a four-star or a three-star dog certainly not a half-star dog. Oh, I like cats too. I actually have 80 of them that live in my alleyway. Too many cats. Sounds strange. I have eight cats that sleep in my sink. Still too many. I don't have any cats, but I sure do enjoy them. I mean, half a star? It doesn't change the five-star man, who he is. I'm a five-star man! I'm a five-star man! One. One. One. One. One. One. I'm a five-star man!
 Hello, Dennis.
 Hi. Hi. Thank you so much for coming. Uh, please, sit. So, what do you want? Frankly, I've I've hit a bit of a rough patch. And it's made me realize that I have not been the best to women. You included. I've manipulated. I've judged. I've ignored your feelings for pursuits of the flesh. But now I know what it feels like to be completely unwanted like you. And it doesn't feel good. Oh, that's really big of you to say. This is for you.
 My God, are you proposing?
 No. No, no. No. I'm not proposing. I would never, uh No, this is, um It's a promise ring.
 Oh.
 So, from now on, Waitress I promise to be nice and true.
 I have a name.
 Do you want the ring or not? I do, yes. Thank you. Wow! Thank you. And in return, of course, I would ask that you promise something to me.
 To be your girlfriend.
 No! No. Stop, okay? D-Don't do that. Just need you to give me a good rating on an Internet Web site.
 Oh, okay. Yeah, sure. I can
 Yeah?
 Yeah.
 That would mean so much to me.
 It really would.
 Okay. I, um I don't have online though.
 What does that You don't have online?
 No. What the hell does that You can just do it on your phone. My phone is It's so old. Oh, my God! That phone is preposterous!
 How long have you had that?
 Nine Ninety Ninety! How do you get on the Internet? I don't. I don't do, like, the e-mails. "The e-mails"? It's e-mail. It's just e-mail. Who doesn't have the Internet in this day and age? What am I doing? Why am I lowering myself to this? I don't need your approval. Goddamn. I don't need anyone's approval. This is stupid. What are you doing, huh? You rating me right now? Well, guess what. Go ahead, rate me! 'Cause I'll rate you, huh? Go ahead, rate me! I don't give a shit! Rate I'll rate you! Zero! Zero! Zero! Rate!
 Okay, sir
 Rate!
 Sir, you need to leave, okay?
 Rate! Rate! Zero! Zero! I will rate every single woman in this restaurant!
 So, he had the mule
 But he forgot the water. Then the guy looks up and he says, "Wait a second. Where am I? In Ohio?" You guys are so funny. Oh, thanks, thanks. Can you give us a second?
 Holy shit!
 What the fuck are we gonna do?
 We've never gotten this far!
 These girls are ready to bang.
 What do we say? What do we do?
 We're gonna have to go off script. No, no, Frank, blow the whistle. Call it, call it.
 We gotta bail.
 What, are you kidding me? Are you crazy? We've come too far to call it!
 My stomach's killing me. Should we talk about that?
 No.
 I got the shits. I do have the shits.
 No, no! Not good. Try another joke, quick! Another joke. I got it. Ladies, got another one for you.
 There's this dago fisherman
 Oh, shit! No, no, Charlie! Charlie, we got it. Oh, shit!
 There goes my cock ring!
 His cock ring fell! I got the power, girls. You think you can rate me? Bullshit! Rate Zero! Zero! Zero rating! Zero rating! Ha-ha! Yeah, I got the power! How does it feel, ladies? I don't give a shit. Yeah! Get the hell outta You know what? I want every single lady in here out of here! Where Where are all are all the ladies? Oh, uh, you know, the crowd's kind of been thinning out. I think it's because we haven't really been tending bar. Well, there's still a bunch of dudes here. Yeah, there's a bunch of dudes here, 'cause I'm crushing it. They're all here to get Dee'd the most empowered woman in Philly. They all do seem to be into her.
 Hey, Dee.
 You again? Listen. I'm not gonna change your rating. Be grateful for the time we had together and beat it.
 Actually I was hoping to hang out again.
 Yeah? I bet you do. It's 'cause I gave you one star. I played you. I don't need stars. I was just hoping to get laid again.
 What?
 Hey, Dee. Any chance I could get Dee'd again? No, you're upset. Aren't you upset? You're upset about the zero rating I gave you. No. You could rate me lower if you like. Hey, are you the whore who bangs everybody? No, I'm not the whore! I'm the empowered woman who gives poor ratings to men. Yeah, sure. Can I get a rating? No! Why would you want that from me? What's going on? Get out of here! All three of you! Get out of here! Okay, yeah, guys, go ahead. Go, go, go. Go. I understand. Okay, I think I know what's happening here. Guys? We've lost sight of what's truly important. You can't derive your self-worth from the opinions of others. No! No, you get your self-worth from when you convince yourself that you're tough and that you're straight.
 I am tough.
 Sure, yes, absolutely. Or that you have got a shot with a woman who we've all banged, but who hates you. Right. You're saying that I'm getting closer. Nice. I got a shot. Yeah, you're getting close, buddy. You'll get there. Or you That your penis could ever possibly remain erect for more than a couple of seconds
 even with a cock ring on.
 Mmm. Or that you are a powerful woman instead of a dirty, dirty whore who bangs toad people. Yeah, guys, guys, guys. Your true power comes not from outside sources but from the delusional stories that you all convince yourselves of. And no one no one can take that away from you. Wow. And what about you? Me? What about me? I'm good, man. I've been doing great. Yeah, this whole thing's been great for me. That's good. Because you're down to zero stars.
 Oh, is he?
 Yeah, down. Zero. I don't give a shit about that. The star rating thing is not
 Can I see that for a second?
 Okay. Let me see that, yeah. Yeah, you know
 Whoa!
 Goddamn it! Goddamn it! You son of a bitch! Happy New Year 2016
 New Year, New Color ;-)                        Happy New Year 2016
 New Year, New Color ;-) You painted your butt blue and nobody noticed the hole in your pants?
 Yeah, it worked. It worked.
 Good trick. As long as it works.
 Yeah!
 That's the way to start a day. And we got news. We got news too. Ooh. Great song and great news? Yeah, and it's all tied in with the song, so it makes sense.
 What's the news?
 Psycho Pete! Psycho Pete's back in town.
 Wait, what?
 Whoa.
 We're gonna get our psycho back, bitches.
 Wait a minute. The guy you went to high school with who killed and ate his family?
 Yeah.
 Yeah, yeah. Yeah, but don't get all hung up on that. He's out of the loony bin, all right? So We're getting the freight train back together, right?
 Freight train!
 Freight train! This is not good. There's no way we can have a maniac hanging out in our bar. He's fine though. Okay? Look, they unscrambled his brain and he's, like, good now.
 Yeah, they sorted him out. They sorted him out.
 No. You cannot sort out a man who kills and eats other human beings. The hospital said he's fine, so he's fine.
 The man did the time.
 Yeah. No, no, no, no. I lived with these maniacs in the loony bin. There is no curing those psycho bastards. It's actually really sad but once your brain's a piece of shit, it's always a piece of shit. There is no way we're having that psychotic mutant anywhere near our bar.
 That's all there is to it.
 Excuse me. Hey, I'm talking to my friends here, so Charlie, seriously, keep that psycho killer away from us, man. Charlie. It's me. It's Peter. I don't know any Peters, so I don't know how you know my name but if you want a beer, just go have a beer, freak. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Peter?
 Pete, is that you?
 Wait, Psycho Pete?
 Hey, Ronald.
 Oh! Dude, you look gnarly. I did not recognize you, man. Psycho Pete! What happened to your hair? You used to have all that hair. Did you, like, yank it out in a fit of rage? That's pretty psycho.
 No, it's just genetics.
 Aw, genetics. So psycho! What are they feeding you, bro?
 I mean, you look huge. Look at that mass.
 You were like 85 pounds before. Yeah, struggling with my weight for a while now. Yeah. Meds don't help.
 Oh. Oh, yeah.
 A psycho struggle!
 Hey, we got something cued up for you here, man. Oh!
 Yeah, we brought something. Come on, come on. Be the caboose. Be the caboose. Actually, you know, j-just turn the music down. Just a bit. Oh, yeah, sorry. We were gonna do the freight train song for you. So, what-what do you want to do? You want to get nuts? You want to get into some shit? Oh, oh, oh, yeah! You used to go right up to babies in carriages and just scream in their faces, you know, they'd cry? Uh, dude, that was psycho. I-I don't feel good about that stuff. I actually regret a lot of the stuff we used to do.
 Do you?
 So, um Do you think I could, like, grab a glass of water or something?
 Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
 Yeah.
 Charlie, can I talk to you for a sec?
 Yeah.
 This guy sucks now.
 Oh, my God.
 Like, I don't like him at all.
 No. He's, like, not psycho at all.
 No, it's like Mild-mannered Pete.
 More like Boring Pete.
 I thought something like this might happen.
 Did you?
 I got a plan.
 'Cause they mess with their brains up there.
 Hey, uh, Pete?
 Yeah. We're gonna go. Okay.
 That's a good plan.
 Yeah. Pete. Sorry about the stuff I was saying
 about the mentally insane earlier.
 Did that anger you? I didn't mean to call psychotic people mutants. It's cool.
 You know, oh
 Oh. We had the, uh Oh, geez, and that's right now.
 Shoot, I wish I could stay.
 Yeah, me too.
 Adios.
 Okay.
 Water.
 See you, man. Good luck. Hey. Charlie, you know, the main problem with people going to these state-run loony bins is the separation between church and state. Explain. You spend most of your time talking to a therapist instead of a priest. A priest is gonna let you off the hook for all the things that you've done.
 You heard Pete. He feels guilty.
 Yeah.
 He needs to be absolved, so that he can go psycho again.
 Okay.
 Yeah.
 I gue I guess I see that. Look, dude, I feel guilty all the time for my thoughts and urges but I'm not gonna talk to a therapist who's gonna make me, you know, deal with it and confront those issues. I talk to a priest, he lets me off the hook. I move on.
 Here's our guy. Hey!
 Hey!
 Cricket!
 Aw, man.
 Crick, Crick, Crick, Crick, Crick
 Cricket, Cricket, Cricket.
 What do you guys want, huh?
 Can we ever get a warm reception from you? Yeah, it's never a nice "hello." What's the cloak thing too? What are you doing here? A Phantom of the Opera thing, or what? I don't like it. Take it off.
 Pop it off. We're trying to have a conversation.
 Holy shit!
 Put it back on!
 Put it on!
 Put it back on!
 What the hell happened to your face?
 You want to know what happened?
 Yeah. This happened to me when I was locked in your burning apartment at Thanksgiving.
 Nah, you weren't there.
 I don't think you were there, man. I was there, Mac, and my whole face burned off. I remember I was there. Why would we want you at Thanksgiving dinner? Especially looking like that. You would've freaked everyone out. This happened at your apartment!
 I can't follow a thing this guy's saying.
 Guys, can we just focus?
 How do you not follow?
 Cricket, we need something from you. Yeah, we need something. And we brought you beer. Beer? Yeah, okay, fine, I'll help you. Just give me the beers. Oh, whoa, whoa! There's five more there. What about the others?
 They're not all for you.
 I'm gonna give you all the beer in the world? What do you guys want? What do you want? Okay, we need you to hear our friend's confession and then absolve him of his sins. Ah. And?
 That's the whole thing. That's what priests do.
 Yeah, that's it. That's it? I don't need to suck him or anything or let him inside me? Why would I want you to No.
 Dude, that's it.
 Just hear the confession. All right. But if he winds up inside me, it will cost you a whole sixer. I mean, that I got my dignity.
 Well, let's go, bud.
 Yeah. Yeah. Let me get one of those other beers too.
 You gotta earn it.
 You have to earn it. So, we'll talk to the hospital administrators. We'll let 'em know that they've made a mistake. Mistake? No, I can't imagine they let him go.
 I'm sure he must've escaped, right?
 I don't like loony bins.
 This is giving me a really bad feeling.
 Yeah. That's understandable, Frank, but these places, they're a necessary evil. We gotta trust the system. Let's just get Pete back into the system. That's right. There's a system in place for everything.
 We don't have to panic. Everything's gonna be fine.
 Yeah. Is it locked?
 Let's go.
 Hello? Hang on. What is going on here? Looks like this place has been shut down for months. Oh, my God, Dennis, listen to this. "Reed Mental Institution was shut down because of statewide cutbacks." Oh, so they just cut all the loonies loose? What? How could they do that? That's-That's insane! I guess it was either that or raise our taxes. What? Raise my taxes? Come on. How much do these vultures need? I already pay a ton in taxes. Then I guess they're gonna have to shut down more of these places. What? Shut down more of these We gotta have somewhere to send our lunatics. Then we're going to have to pay more taxes. What? I'm not paying more in taxes. I won't do it. Don't speak of it again! This is strange. I swear, this is all too familiar. Whoa. It's okay, Froggy. I'll keep you moist. Oh. This is it! This is it! What? What are you babbling about? This is the nitwit school I was shanghaied to when I was a kid. That one that you had your mommy tell them to tell you that you didn't have donkey brains. I knew I didn't have donkey brains. But everybody else did. Especially my roommate, the frog kid. Oh, you had a frog kid roommate? Sure. Froggy and I used to take care of each other. He was a good kid. We watched each other's back. One time, we escaped and they chased us down with those big nets they use to catch dogs. Did you grow up in a cartoon? I can't believe they set them loose. Froggy can't be in the world out there. Froggy never did anything wrong. I gotta find Froggy. Froggy! Froggy!
 He's unzipped.
 Yeah, all right, look. What are we gonna do, Dee? We can't have Pete wandering the streets. I don't want him near me. We gotta get him sent somewhere. Or Ooh! What about that nut, uh nuthouse in West Chester?
 Ah, it says that one's been shut down too.
 Oh, come on! I pay so much money in taxes already. Where's that going? Well, they used that money to open up the Eagles' new practice facility. That makes sense. That's kind of a no-brainer.
 We can't have our guys out there twisting ankles.
 Yeah. A man of Shady McCoy's abilities, he needs a proper landing strip. Gotta get our maniacs in green set up in a nice facility.
 Sophie's choice, huh?
 Mm-hmm. Oof. Go Birds. Go Birds. Go Birds. Is there something weighing on your mind, my son? Wh-What? Who Who is that? It's time to confess your sins. Unburden yourself and be absolved. Is that a glory hole? Yes. It is, my son. But it'll cost you a whole sixer if you want to unburden yourself in that way. Uh, that being said, I'm open to it.
 Stay on topic here, man.
 Just absolve the man and let's go. I don't even know what I'm absolving him of. All right? He has to confess something first. What's going on in here? We'll just do the confession for him and God'll get what we're going for.
 Cricket, we're gonna confess.
 Okay, fine. All right, um, he used to scream in babies' faces. Well, that's just funny.
 They'd be all freaked out.
 Okay, no, you know what he used to do?
 He used to gather, like, cats and dogs
 Oh, yeah. And then put them into a little room and have 'em battle it out. That's just cats' and dogs' nature, to fight so I don't see a problem with that.
 Oh, also, he murdered and ate his family.
 Right. What? See, there was like a Christmas dinner thing with the eating of his family and a burning of the house down.
 Is this Psycho Pete?
 Yeah, yeah. Jesus Christ! That guy's a goddamn maniac. I'm not absolving him. He should be in jail. Hey, guys? Pete, is that you?
 Hey, man.
 I'm gonna get out of here, okay?
 Oh.
 I'm gonna use use the women's restroom. Oh, sure! Yeah, a lot of people in here.
 Kind of a full house.
 Yeah. Yeah, the women's room, I'm sure, is
 Goddamn it, Cricket.
 Uh, is it safe?
 Is it safe to be here?
 Relax, Cricket. It's safe. The guy's all docile and shit now. He's on these meds No, look, he-he might look calm on the outside but there's a storm brewing on the inside. I think I know what the problem is. He's psycho. He's straight-up possessed by the devil.
 Okay, you lost me.
 Okay, think about it. He used to be fun crazy. You know? And the devil was like, "I like this dude. I'm gonna get involved." He jumps in there, makes him evil crazy. Then the meds get thrown on top. They shut everybody down. Okay. All right, so where you going with that? We gotta get him off the meds and get the devil out.
 You want to do an exorcism?
 Of course I want to do an exorcism.
 That's what the whole thing
 That's where I come in. Why didn't you come out like, "Let's do an exorcism"? I can't lead with the exorcism. We'll get the demon and the goblin out and we'll have our fun Pete back.
 I want to get the demon out but not a goblin.
 We should get 'em all out. Get the demon, the goblin, the ghoul, and then you got Pete. Well, no, no, no, no. There's no goblins. There's no ghouls. It's just demons, okay?
 Well, they're all made up.
 That's why he burned your face, you son of a bitch!
 Yeah, that's true, man.
 Okay, look, I'm getting hot.
 I'm getting too hot.
 Yeah, we're getting hot. Let's just go get the exorcism going. And let's get you, like, a hat or a hood or All right, now listen. Let me talk to this doctor, okay? I'll explain to him that we have a dangerous psychopath in our bar and he could snap at any minute. And because there are no facilities to lock him in we need to get him his medication as soon as possible
 in order to avoid a massacre.
 No. No, no, no, no, no. Just let me handle this. I'll act crazy and then he'll prescribe them to me. You will sit here and you will be quiet. Your bad acting will only confuse him and it will infuriate me. I'm gonna ask him about the frog kid.
 Don't do that. Don't do that.
 Oh, my God. No, Froggy and I need each other. He's out there all alone.
 You
 I'm gonna find Froggy. You are never gonna be able to find a goddamn frog person, okay?
 I'm gonna find him.
 Guys, please. Just let me handle it. I got it. Hello. Thank you for waiting. I'm Dr. Coleman. How can I help you today? Yes. Do you have some sort of donkey-brain database?
 No.
 I'm looking for a kid the frog kid. Just search for any half-man, half-amphibious creature. Yeah, okay, no. That's not why we're here. Doctor, I've always relied upon the kindness of strangers. What are you do What is that, A Streetcar Named Desire? I'm in desperate need of medical intervention. You see, years ago I tried to burn my college roommate down to the box springs whilst she was sleeping. And now I have a hankering to do it again.
 Dr. Zimmerman!
 Excuse me? Dr. Albert Zimmerman the old bastard who ran the nitwit farm. He'll know where Froggy is. I'll find him. Yeah.
 I'll find the frog kid.
 Yeah, go find him.
 I'm gonna find him.
 Uh, I'm not sure I understand what's happening.
 I'm schizophrenic.
 Dee? I swear you would be of more use to me if I skinned you and turned your skin into a lampshade. Or fashioned you into a piece of high-end luggage. I can even add you to my collection. Are you saying that you have a collection of skin luggage? Of course I'm not, Dee. Don't be ridiculous. Think of the smell. You haven't thought of the smell, you bitch! Now you say another word and I swear to God I will dice you into a million little pieces. And put those pieces in a box a glass box that I will display on my mantel. All right. Now that that's settled, we can have a normal conversation. Now, Doctor, I'm here to talk to you about a man a very dangerous and a very unstable man. Dr. Zimmerman?
 Yeah?
 It's me. Don't you recognize me? Yes. Yes. Of course I recognize you. Good, 'cause I got questions. What did you do with him? Where is he?
 Where is whom?
 The frog kid. Froggy! Oh, God, Doc. I got to find him. But I don't understand. I got to know where he is, Doc, because I got to help him. I-I owe him that much! But, Franklin Yes? You are Froggy. Huh? I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America It was you, Frank. You are the frog kid. You were an outcast as a child so you created an imaginary friend. It's okay, Froggy. I'll keep you moist. But the lines of reality became blurred. Soon you didn't know where Frank began and Froggy ended. Oh, yeah. I see that. I remember that now. What are you doing? You're having an episode again, Frank, aren't you? We've got to catch the little froggy. Put that down. Get out of here.
 Here we go. Come on.
 I'm not sick anymore. I'm not a frog.
 I know I'm not a frog!
 Catch the froggy! We have to catch the froggy. Let's go through the through the through the the checklist.
 Um, crucifix.
 I got it. Got that. Holy water. We got that. We got all the stuff. We got the straps. We got everything, man.
 Okay.
 So, what's the plan? We're gonna, like, bum-rush this guy from behind? Whoa, whoa. Guys, come on. No one is taking me from behind, all right? Unless you have crack. If you have crack, let's boogie. No one is going into your asshole. I wouldn't let them without the crack. Can we just Let's go through the basic beats, all right?
 Uh, talk a bunch of Latin.
 Yeah, that's me. I'll fake it. Wait. What do you mean, you'll fake it? You don't know your Latin anymore? Don't worry about it. I can sell anything, you know? You know how many times I fake on the streets? You know? You have to fake. The guys that don't fake, they're the ones that get it the worst. Cricket, just, like, anything we can do to have you not talk about like, sucking penises or getting raped in the butt? It just keeps popping up. Oh! Oh! Hey, I got it. Problem solved. I got Pete's drugs. Oh, we got drugs? All right, crank me up, baby! We going up? Down? How we doing this, huh? Cricket! Ugh!
 Oh, the face? Yeah, sorry.
 Jesus Christ! That is gross, man.
 What the hell?
 God's wrath. He had some sort of Thanksgiving incident. He went to some party Yeah, at your house! Everyone was there. How do you not remember this? No, you were not at our place 'cause we would not have invited you to our Thanksgiving thing.
 Never mind. Doesn't matter.
 How the hell did you get drugs for Pete? Well, I had a simple conversation with a reasonable man and that man wrote me a prescription. Mmm, yeah. He got the drugs by being a real-life, actual psychopath. She keeps Uh, no. Ridiculous, okay? No, the man asked me a few questions.
 Mm-hmm.
 I answered those questions as honestly as I could.
 Right.
 Next thing I know, I'm walking out the door
 with meds for borderline personality disorder.
 Yup.
 That's how you get shit done.
 No, no. That's how you get diagnosed. Where is he? Where's Pete? I'm gonna put him out of his misery! No, Frank! We're gonna help this guy, all right? But there's no helping him, Dennis. Don't you understand? I know. I'm the frog kid, right? It was all in my mind, but I got cured. But I could have another episode. If I had another episode, what do I do? I eat a couple of flies. If he has another episode, he kills us.
 He's a murderer.
 Dude, dude. No, I'm not. Huh? I'm-I'm not a murderer. That's just what a murderer would say. No, no, no, really. All that stuff with my family it's just it's just a rumor people started about me. You know, kind of like all the rumors you guys started about me?
 What rumors? What are you talking about?
 Huh? You know, that I'm crazy and stuff.
 Well, yeah, uh, crazy awesome, you know.
 Like crazy bad-ass! Yeah, except-except none of it was true and then the more people spread it around the more afraid people were of me. Well, wait a second. Then why did you get sent to a mental institution? Social anxiety disorder mixed with depression. I was really more of a danger to myself. I was always talking about committing suicide.
 Ooh.
 Oh. That's why I wanted to reconnect with you guys 'cause a lot of people, they can't deal with that kind of stuff but you always liked me, so I figured you guys could help me cope with it. That we would help
 Yeah!
 Oh, yeah, yeah. Well, we could help you cope with it. Um
 Or
 Hmm? This thing's going all the way to Los Angeles, buddy, all right?
 City of Angels!
 Yeah, a place where no one is depressed. You can surf the sadness away. This is exactly what you need, Pete. I want to thank you guys for trying to help me.
 Suppose it could be good to get a fresh start.
 Yeah, all that. Save the chitchat for the hoboes.
 You got a long trip.
 Get on the train! Bon voyage. All right. That takes care of that. Problem solved. All right. Well, uh, you guys want to go pop by the new Eagles facility?
 Ooh.
 Heard they're having an open practice.
 Yeah!
 Let's go, Eagles!
 Let's go, Birds!
 Ride that train! Go Birds! Go Birds! Oh! Well, George, good luck. Enjoy Philadelphia, City of Brotherly Love.
 Yeah.
 They're gonna take great care of you here. Rain, rain, buzzing. All right, get on out of here. Take care, pal.
 Bye.
 Okay. Well, that takes care of that. Problem solved. Let's get out of here. Happy New Year 2016
 New Year, New Color ;-)                        Happy New Year 2016
 New Year, New Color ;-) Frank, pick up! Pick up, buddy. Pick up, pick up, pick up!
 Hellol
 I got a Code Red here, pal. I got a Code Red. I got tipped off that the health inspector's coming today. The guy's gonna be here in 15 minutes. They're pulling a fast one on us! Okay, I got the place looking pretty good already 'cause I was anticipating something like this, but do me a favor. Make sure no one is in the bar today, okay? I cannot have those guys in here making a mess. You got it? Oh, shit. What the hell is this? Why are there chickens everywhere? No time to explain it to you. You wouldn't get it anyway.
 What are you painting?
 It's a new sign, okay? A Place for Steaks. What? No, I can't have you put that sign up. The health inspector's coming, like, any minute!
 So what?
 So what? We're not Carmine's. I can't have them see the sign. Who gives a shit? We always get a passing grade. Yeah, we get a passing grade because I bust my ass to make sure that happens, okay? And we don't pretend that we're a restaurant!
 Look, this is
 crazy! No sign! No, we're using the sign, because the sign's a big part of the plan. What is the plan? What is happening? Charlie, we found a loophole in the system. Yeah, it's a closing loophole. It involves airline miles and points. You're doing a chicken-and-airline-miles scam today? It is a great plan. We do not have a ton of time to explain it to you.
 We're busy
 Okay, fine, whatever.
 I get it.
 No, you don't.
 It's a good plan, Charlie.
 Frank, Jesus Christ, man.
 Where are your shoes?
 I lost 'em in the bathroom. All right, goddamn it. I gotta think here. Here's what we're gonna do. We gotta get all these chickens and coops and feathers and everything in the back office.
 Now! Go!
 Why the hell would we do that? I assume you don't want a health inspector seeing anything about a chicken "scam" you're trying to pull off.
 That's a good point.
 All right, yeah, fine. But don't pretend like you understand the plan, 'cause that's gonna piss me off. Okay. Dee, get the joke stool in the basement, all right? Can't have it out. What? No way. It's hilarious. It's not hilarious. It's just a stool with a nail sticking out of it. Yeah, when it pokes their butts, they scream 'cause they got a nail right in the butt. You You don't understand comedy. You don't understand comedy. That's not a joke, it's a lawsuit.
 Just put it in the basement.
 Fine, all right, fine.
 Can't have the guy sitting on that
 Okay! Relax! All right, Frank, let's go. Bathroom!
 Come on! I gotta find your shoes!
 All right. Let's go, let's go. Then help with the chickens if you can, please. Move, move, move, move. How could you have possibly lost your shoes in Oh, my God. No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
 What's wrong with the toilet?
 Looks clogged. What the hell? I just had these all in, like, perfect working condition.
 Must be my shoes.
 Your shoes? What are you talking about? Well, when I said I lost my shoes, I didn't mean I didn't know where they were. It's just that they were gone. You flushed your shoes down the toilet? Why would you do that? It's an anxiety thing, Charlie. Everybody's moving so fast all of a sudden, it freaks me out. Flushing things gives me control.
 It's a thing.
 That's not a thing.
 It's a thing.
 That's not a thing. I've never heard of that thing. All right, I gotta dig 'em out. Want me to get a snake tool? No, I'm just gonna Look, go help with the chickens, okay? Help with the chickens, please? Get 'em in the back office. Do whatever you can. Charlie, I need you for something. Goddamn, this thing's broken. Look, give me that fix bag right there. Uh, yeah, yeah, sure. Hey, listen, um We've got a huge problem out there, dude. Earlier, when Dennis said "We've got a really good idea with this plan" that wasn't entirely accurate 'cause it was actually my idea and I think the usage of the word "we" in there is really confusing because how can a whole group of people have the same idea at the same time? What, do they just say it all at once? It's ludicrous. I don't understand why you're angling for credit right now. We'll go through the normal arbitration process at the end of this. Right. Well, I've just been screwed at the last three arbitration processes and I just want you to be on my side, you know?
 'Cause I really need you.
 Whatever, dude. I don't care. Wait. What happened to the glory hole cover? I took it off. I I thought you you put it on there by accident. No, I put it up there because I don't want the health inspector seeing that we have a place for a person to get their dick sucked by a stranger. Dude, you are taking this whole inspection thing way too seriously, okay? Back to the credit issue you just don't know what it's like to be overlooked. Oh, my God, that's exactly what's happening to me right now. You know what? Maybe I'll casually bring it up to him and then he won't know what we're talking about. Ha! I got a fix! I got a fix right here All right, we'll just put this up and boom that's pretty good. What was that?
 Why did the lights go out?
 Uh, that could be the vacuum sealer. That thing probably pulls a lot of power.
 Vacuum sealer? What the hell?
 Yeah.
 All right, where's this packaging machine thing?
 Keg room. Keg room? Okay, good, they're back on. Frank, Frank, don't go away! Keep moving chickens, yes, but I need you to take the "Talk American" sign down. Are you sure? Maybe he's a racist too. The health inspector's not a racist, Frank. Take it down, please, okay? And shoes shoes, please? Find some shoes.
 All right, guys. This
 Oh, shit! This thing's tits! No, no, no, you can't use this machine, okay? It blew the surge protector. We can't do the plan without the packaging machine. How else are we supposed to vacuum-seal the steaks? Steaks? This is a chicken-and-air-mile-and-steak scam now?
 Yeah.
 All right, fine. I can work with it. I can work with it. Just do me a favor. Start packaging lemons and limes and things.
 Make it seem like we package shit at the bar.
 Fun. I need you down in the basement. I need your reach. Real quick. Come on.
 Okay.
 Hey, Dennis. Could I talk to you for a second? Do me a favor. I got a battery here. Reach up in the carbon monoxide detector
 Pop it in real quick.
 Yeah, you got it. Hey, Charlie, while we're down here I wanted to talk to you about ideas and how funny it is that they can come from all kinds of different places.

 Somebody could say something funny and might spark an idea
 Shh, shh. Dee, zip up the mouth.
 No, I know.
 But before the arbitration, I need you to understand
 Dee, shut up! That's G-sharp. I got it. I got it, yeah. Is it broken? It won't shut the hell up. No, it's doing exactly what it's supposed to do and that's the problem. There's a ton of carbon monoxide down here, so I don't want it doing that. What? Why? Actually, what I do is I block the vents to the furnace and that fills the basement with dangerous gases. Drives the rodents away. I always do it leading up to an inspection.
 Is that safe?
 No, no. It's incredibly unsafe. We can't be down here too long. So get the battery, and we gotta roll.
 Oh, my God.
 Yeah, get it out.
 Then just make it look like
 Goddamn you, Charlie. Goddamn it, go.
 All right, go, go, go. You getting light-headed?
 Yes! Why'd I hear a squeal? Oh, no, dude.
 Why are you bleeding?
 Dennis scratched me. Mac was doing that thing where he tries to casually bring something up to me, like I don't notice. Come to me like a man. Talk about being tough all the time.
 Can't even look me in the eyes.
 Okay.
 How's this for shoes, Charlie?
 Aw, no, Frank. Come on, man! You're gonna get black paint everywhere! I've changed my mind about the stool. No, no stool. Stool's out. No way! It's just that it was my idea, Dennis. It's sort of like the jean shorts, where you Look at me when you're talking to me! Oh, shit. I think the steaks are here.
 Oh.
 Nice. Whoa. That's a big truck. Oh, shit. No, no, no. I can't have this truck out here! Hey, uh, is this Carmine's Steak House? You're looking at the sign, pal. Oh. Hey, you guys mind if I get a quick bite here before we begin?
 You want to eat here?
 Uh, yeah. It's a long drive back to Ohio and I figured I was gonna be here a while, unloading all these steaks. Well, you won't be here that long, right? I mean, it's only 400 steaks. Excuse me, I gotta use the toilet.
 Oh, gosh, you know what?
 Oh, shit.
 The thing is, our kitchen's not open
 Okay, you know what? Yeah. Go ahead, uh, leave the keys in it, maybe pop the back, we'll help you get started. I'm gonna fire up the grill and all set. Okay. We got you covered.
 Oh, son of a bitch. Did you flush your shirt?
 Yep. Okay, I don't want to interrupt here, Charlie, but we got a major problem on our hands. We are not a restaurant that serves food. How are we gonna package 4,000 steaks?
 We can handle it, okay?
 Dee, we should've never done your stupid plan! My plan? No way. This was Frank's idea. Wasn't my idea. Dennis was all over it. Me? No, this was Mac's stupid plan.
 Then why'd you scratch me?
 'Cause I was irritated with you. Look, we can handle all of this, all right? Excuse me, with all due respect, Charlie, you don't even know what the goddamn plan is. Okay, with all due respect to you I think I understand it fully, okay? You guys used Frank's credit card. You bought a bunch of airline miles. You used those airline miles to purchase 400 steaks. Knowing that this delivery company delivered all variety of animal products your plan was to contaminate the steaks with chicken feathers by rubbing live chickens all over them. Then you were gonna repackage the steaks at which point, you were gonna return the contaminated steaks for actual cash taking advantage of a loophole in the current airline miles system, correct?
 Very good, Charlie.
 That is it. That is it. That was the plan, but I mean
 We basically had already explained it to you, so
 Right. But what you didn't plan for was a hungry delivery guy who'd driven all the way from Ohio. Or that Dee's oversized fingers could've accidentally pressed "zero" again when she ordered the steaks online I'm assuming you did the typing, Dee, yes?
 Goddamn it.
 Dee, you bitch. But none of this matters to me, okay? Because today is inspection day. A day that I pride myself on. A day that I've never failed on. And I don't plan to begin failing now. Listen to me and listen close, like you've never done before. We are going to pull this thing off, so help me God. Oh, son of a bitch.
 Okay, here we go.
 Dee, Frank, come with me. I want you guys to set up a table and chair in the alleyway, all right? This guy's gonna be dining in our "patio area." Dee, take his order, make him think it's a real restaurant. Frank, as soon as you're done, haul ass down the alleyway, move the guy's truck, all right? All right, I need you guys to take down that Carmine sign. I can't have it up when the inspector gets here. Get me a steak off the truck, okay? All right, I'm gonna show this guy to his table. Here we go. Oh, hey, right on time! Here's my guy. You know what? Don't even bother unloading, 'cause I'm gonna have my guys handle it, okay?
 You sure?
 Oh, absolutely.
 Keys are in the truck, right?
 Yeah
 Come in. Let's have a bite to eat.
 Okay. I know you're a hungry guy.
 Oh, it's a nice spot.
 Yeah, it's a nice spot. We can't complain. We can't complain. See all these booths over here? They're nice. And we got a patio area. I think you're gonna enjoy sitting there. You know what? A booth is fine. No, see, look, we got these old stools and old booths but the patio area is really something special.
 You know, you're a top-shelf customer, right?
 Well, I You want to be having a top-shelf experience. And here we go. Welcome! Please, make yourself comfortable. Yeah, have a seat and, uh, enjoy the patio. Uh, this is an alley. I think I'd rather just sit inside. Spends all day in a truck and he wants to eat indoors! Hey, the man needs fresh air!
 Dee, take his order, okay?
 Yes, yes. Uh, what can I get you? Okay, here we go. Here we go. Okay. Here we go. Mac! Steak! Steak! All right, back on this! Dennis, I need you to be the face in the bar, okay? I accept that responsibility. Frank, go, go, go! Okay, here's my guy. Right on time. Come on now, buddy. Here we go. Wait. Wait, wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Who's this? No, no, no, ma'am. Ma'am, I'm sorry. You can't park here.
 Are you the owner?
 Uh, yeah, Charlie Kelly.
 Who's asking?
 I'm, uh, Sandy Lawler. I'm with the City Board of Health. I'll be conducting an impromptu inspection of your bar. Okay, yeah, uh, what happened to Alan? Alan was let go on account of his leniency.
 Shall we begin?
 Okay. Uh, sure. All right, let's get going. Right in here. This is our, uh, bartender over here.
 All right, all right, all right.
 Okay. He's a bit of a character. Where would you like to begin? Let's, uh, begin with the bathrooms. Okay, that's fine. Come on in this way. I assume all the toilets are in working order. Oh, absolutely. Yeah, I wouldn't bother checking if I were you. I think I will. You're standing awfully close to me. Sorry about that. Yeah. Do I smell cheese? I'm gonna leave you to it. You do your thing, okay? Dennis, heads up.
 What are these?
 They're car keys, okay? Just picked her pocket.
 Go move her car, so Frank can pull the truck up.
 Okay. Hey, Dee, hold up. Okay, put this on the furnace, all right?
 Cook it up good.
 Oh, no, he wants a turkey burger.
 What? Why?
 I don't know. I offered it to him.
 Why would you do that?
 You said pretend we're a restaurant. He looked like a turkey burger kind of guy. He looked like a turkey burger kind of guy? Just put it on the furnace. Cook it up. Tell him you got the order wrong. Just tell him you got the thing wrong. Oh, my God, what a stupid bitch. What a stupid bitch she is. Okay. Dude, what's the plan with the chickens? Okay, everything's going in the vent, all right? Chickens, cages, they're all going in the vent. But first, count to 30, and then start moaning into it.
 Why?
 Dude, just do it, okay? Don't ask questions. Just moan in the vent. After a couple of moans say, "I'm sorry."
 You got it?
 Okay, sure, yeah.
 Twenty-eight, 27 Okay?
 Twenty-six, 25, 24 Twenty-three, 22, 21, 20 Nineteen, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14 Thirteen, 12, 11, 10, nine And how are we looking in here?
 It's acceptable so far.
 Okay. Oh, you hear that? Oh, I guess there's somebody in there. It sounds like there's somebody in there, yeah. Let's take a little peek. Hey, buddy, how about a courtesy cough or something next time?
 I'm sorry.
 Don't be sorry, you know? Just, uh, give us all a heads-up you're in here, save us all the embarrassment, you know? Some people, they got, like, no sort of social boundaries or anything like that. It's really kind of an awkward thing.
 Did you meet our bartender?
 Hey! All right, all right, all right. That's right. I think I introduced you to him.
 You want to check out the women's bathroom?
 Yeah. Women's bathroom, I assure you, is spotless. Well, we'll see. No, we actually hardly ever have women in here, so But we're not being graded on that. All right, in you go. Go ahead and tinkle. Move your bowels if you have to. All right, back office, okay? Chickens, vents
 Everything's going in the vents. Go, go, go!
 Okay, okay. The furnace cooked it way too fast. It's charred to shit.
 It doesn't matter.
 It doesn't matter? I'm gonna give him the wrong order and just hand him a burned-up steak?
 He's gonna be pissed.
 This guy's not grading our bar. I don't care if he has the worst dining experience of his life. Give him the burned steak.
 How's this?
 How am I gonna get all these steaks off the truck? You don't have to get 'em all. We're just gonna contaminate a couple. Then we're gonna put the chickens onto the truck.
 Why?
 Frank, we're gonna contaminate the truck. We're gonna contaminate the whole truck, all right? That goes to the keg room. And for the love of God, find a shirt! Find a shirt, Frank! All right. Okay, okay. Ah, okay. Come on, come on, come on. Okay. Nice.
 Done.
 Well done! Okay! Up top! All right, here's the plan: Got to go to the third stall vents in the bathroom. Chickens are coming out there. Everything goes to the keg room, right? Start rubbing chickens on steaks. Seal them up good. Then put everything on the truck chickens, steaks, everything on the truck!
 Got it, got it.
 We're contaminating the truck, guys. That's the plan!
 What is this? What are you doing?
 I'm painting a shirt! No! All right, look. Just, uh, get out of sight! Or go to the keg room, hide out. I'm gonna send Dee to you in a minute, all right? In fact, keep painting. That's fine. But go to the keg room. Oh, my God, what an idiot. Hi. Oh, hi, hello. I'm sorry, is there a-a problem out here? He's making a big stink about the steak. The steak is burnt to shit. It's not what I ordered. Would you look at that? Man, I'll tell you what. I'm gonna give you a beer on the house. Come inside.
 How nice!
 No, I'll just take it here. Actually we don't have our outdoor liquor license. I gotta have you drink it inside. In you go! This is the worst restaurant I've ever been to. So sorry. Terribly sorry, sir. Terribly sorry. Aw, Charlie, that's not good! What are you talking about? It's great! Thinks we're a real restaurant. Okay, Dee, table, chairs everything's going in the Dumpster. Then please push it, like, you know, another couple inches from the door
 It doesn't look like six feet to me.
 What? Of course it does. No, no, Dee. It looks like five and a half. You think she's gonna notice six inches? You move the goddamn Dumpster, you bitch, okay? Then haul ass down the alleyway. Okay. Hi!
 Hi! How'd it go in there?
 Uh, fine, I suppose. Everything checks out.
 Hello.
 Hello. Yeah, lots of customers. We're a bustling business, so why don't you head to the alleyway and see if there's anything there that needs, uh, inspecting. Ooh, sir whoa, whoa! Sorry.
 No, no!
 I'm gonna need you to drink that in our VIP lounge area.
 I just want to drink it here.
 Come on! A very important customer like yourself sitting on a bar with the regulars? I think you're gonna enjoy the exclusivity of the lounge area.
 So enjoy that.
 It's not a lounge Hey, all right, all right, all right!
 Why are you doing that to me?
 I don't know. I don't need you to do that to me.
 I gotta finish
 Yeah, you gotta finish the job!
 How'd it go with the Dumpster? You move it?
 Huh? Yes. Okay, here's the plan. Give this to Frank. Tell him G-sharp. Then you gotta paint him head to toe in black.
 Why would I do any of that?
 Dee, just do it, okay? Just do it, you goddamn bitch. Oh, you bitch! Stop questioning everything! Oh, that goddamn bitch. Oh, that goddamn bitch! Oh, my God, she's gonna ruin it all. And how are we out here?
 Everything will be in the report.
 Yeah, sure.
 Mind if I head behind the bar?
 No! Sure! That's not an issue. Yeah, come check out the bar. You know, the bar is sort of the lifeblood of a bar. I said bar and bar, twice! And, oh, you know what? There's drainage pipes down there that I don't want you to check. "Drainage pipes"? I'm sorry, Mr. Kelly.
 I have to check it out.
 If you gotta do it, you gotta do it. Now! You know, but I mean, I know that they're a little wet, they get damp and, uh Actually, they look pretty good. Oh, all right. Well, that's great. Uh, so one last thing. I suppose I want to show the blender here, for our mixing up frozen drinks. I don't really need to see that.
 Turn it up higher?
 I don't really need to No, that's not a good idea, but here we go See? Yeah, we blew the power. It's not really environmentally safe to turn it up that high. That's why we never really do it. I should dock you for that one. I'm not gonna. That's a joke. I'd love to show you our packaging machine I keep in the keg room. Here, come take a peek here. Look at all this. Look at all of this! Oh, my!
 This is
 A bit excessive? Yes, I know. But I'm a little anal when it comes to securing the perishables. I just don't want anything to get rotten, and that's about as good as it gets. You're not the only one with standards around here. So come on down to the basement. You can check this out. Okay, so, uh, watch your step on the stairs here. Wouldn't want you to trip on any old paint cans or anything like that but hopefully everything down here, you know has been properly painted and put where it's supposed to be.
 So you know what I'm saying?
 No, I don't.
 Where's the carbon monoxide detector?
 Carbon monoxide detector! All right, so you reach up there and you give that a poke and everything should
 Excellent.
 All right, that was excellent.
 Uh, I'm feeling a little light-headed.
 Yeah, it could be the stairs. Or, you know, maybe you're just dizzy by the cleanliness.
 Let's get you out of here. No sense in lingering around.
 What? You checked the carbon monoxide and that's all you gotta do there. Okay, let's see. Uh, I think we covered everything.
 I mean, uh, doorknob? That works.
 Yeah. Showed you all the packaged produce.
 Hey, did you meet our bartender?
 All right, all right. We're not paying for contaminated steaks. Your entire truck is filled with chickens. You want me to return 4,000 steaks? This restaurant is insane.
 "Restaurant"?
 Yeah, if you count a bowl of peanuts, you know? We get the drunks in here, they get all ornery and confused. What are you gonna do? It comes with the territory.
 I'd love to spend a little bit more time in here
 Ah, that's about it, Mr. Kelly.
 That's it?
 Yeah.
 Oh
 Hey! Yes? Are you talking to me? Yeah. What is it? All right, all right, all right. Yes. Okay. You know, all right, all right, all right kind of says it all. So, here we go. Uh, last thing, Sandy. Is this concrete regulation?
 You know, I know there's some cracks and
 It looks fine. But I'll tell you what's not fine, Mr. Kelly, and that's the Dumpster. The regulation is exactly six feet and you were at five and a half. Oh, that goddamn bitch. I know Alan would let this slide, but I'm not Alan. I'll have to dock you for that. Okay, well, I understand. I assure you that those responsible, they'll be dealt with. However, you do have an amazingly clean bar and therefore I'm giving Paddy's Pub the highest possible grade.
 You are?
 Congratulations. Oh, my You got me with the whole Dumpster thing!
 Oh, man, that's really, really exciting stuff!
 Oh, well
 It's just really fantastic.
 That was nice.
 Have a wonderful day.
 Okay. Okay. Guys, we got the highest grade! I didn't think we were gonna do it 'cause of the Dumpster, but she got us the highest grade!
 The highest grade of
 The health inspection! We passed the health inspection! Boo! Oh, yeah, we don't we don't give a shit about that. Yeah, we were excited about the airline miles thing. Yeah, that's cool too, but the health inspection was the whole thing! I pulled it off! It was like, "It goes here, goes there!" I did the whole thing. Charlie, come on. We always pass, okay? We never have a hard time passing. It's not a big deal. Nobody gives a shit. You didn't do anything that special. That's how you make a joke stool right there! Ow, Charlie!
 Did you do that?
 Yeah, you know what? I think I did. You did it? Oh, that's so funny!
 Are you kidding me?
 I thought I saw you! Are you kidding? Unbelievable. Happy New Year 2016
 New Year, New Color ;-)                        Happy New Year 2016
 New Year, New Color ;-) That's what's good about a beer.
 It's good.
 It just keeps cycling through you. Guys, guys, guys. We've got terrible news.
 What do you got?
 You know that Chinese fish factory across the street? The one with the horrible smell?
 Ew.
 Of course. Disgusting. They've installed security cameras pointed directly at Paddy's.
 What?
 They're pointing at us?
 They can't do that.
 Bullshit! Are they spying on us? Yes, I think they're spying on us, and you know what else? They bought the building next door. They are expanding like crazy. I'm telling you, it is only a matter of time before the Chinese take us over. Oh, they've always been very secretive for a fish factory. And do you ever feel like maybe they're using that fish smell to cover up, like, maybe some other mysterious smell? It is an incredibly strong smell. It's turned me off of fish.
 Me too.
 Oh, I'm off of fish.
 And I used to eat so much fish, guys.
 I love fish.
 Because of all the good fatty acids.
 A good fish, a solid fish? Protein, omega numbers So many omegas threes, fours and fives.
 Melts in your mouth.
 You get to eat all your scales.
 Don't eat the scales.
 You won't get scales unless it's a fish or a reptile.
 Don't eat reptiles.
 I'm not eating all reptiles, just the good ones. Okay, guys, we got a plan. Dee, come with us.
 Yeah.
 You're gonna help us gather intel.
 Okay. There she goes.
 Let's do it. Come on. And then, what do Frank and I do? Well, you guys just hang back, uh, do your thing. Don't eat reptiles and just hang out.
 You're going with Dee over us?
 Right. Is this 'cause you guys have been living at her place ever since your fire? I feel like, you burn your place down, you move into Dee's
 and now you're getting all buddy-buddy
 Yeah, chummy-chummy. Yeah, I guess so, if you need. That's crazy! Dee over us? I mean, you can't count on her. You're completely unreliable, Dee, really. You're, like, all gangly and uncoordinated. And she's constantly gonna back-sass you.
 Oh, she'll argue with everything you say.
 It's bullshit. No, you know what's bullshit? Me getting boxed out all the time. And these guys have finally realized by living with me that old Dee is pretty cool after all, and pretty funny too. So maybe I shouldn't be the butt of everybody's jokes anymore. Let's Let's not get crazy, Dee.
 You're always gonna be the butt of our jokes.
 Whatever. Let's roll. We're still gonna make jokes at your expense. All right. Uh, just hang. Uh, we're good.
 Huh?
 What the hell was that? Something stinks here, Charlie, and it ain't just the fish. The other day, I was trying to get in the back office
 Yeah?
 Dennis had the door locked. Mac locked the door too.
 What is that?
 Who locks the office door? I feel like they're always sneaking around now, and they're all nervous. Something big is definitely going down. I got a plan. How about you and I spy on that Chinese factory? But, Charlie, I trust the Chinese as far as I could throw their factory.
 Mm-hmm.
 But the real threat isn't abroad, Charlie. It's right here at home. We gotta spy on Mac and Dennis. Oh, God, that smell. The air quality in here is terrible! How do these people survive in this? Ooh. Well, you know the Chinese. It's business first, breathing second. Goddamn it! At least we know it's a real fish factory and not some sort of a front for something.
 Well
 Dee, we don't know that for sure. That's why you gotta get a job here.
 I gotta get a job here? What am I looking for?
 Shady practices, you know? Sketchy dealings. Schematics. Ah, human rights violations, anything, Dee. Just-Just, you know, gather intel. Okay. What are you guys gonna do? Dee, you're on a need-to-know basis here. There's a chain of command here. You're at the very bottom.
 You're way down.
 At least tell me what the whole plan is. Dee, the one time we bring you in on a thing instead of Charlie and all we get is back-sass and questions?
 Do you want to be on the team or not?
 Yeah. Yeah, I want to be part of the team, okay? Yes, sorry. So how do I gather the intel? Oh, Jesus Chri Talk to people. I don't know. Flirt with the manager. He'll love how "pretty" and "blonde" you are. Don't do that. I'm blonde. Look, my mind goes to that office up there. What kind of shady shit's going on in there? Now I'm doing your job for you. Let's get Charlie. I don't want to hold her hand. No, no, no, no, no. No Charlie. No Charlie, okay? I got this, you guys. I got this.
 Don't worry about me. I got this.
 Okay, we need you, Dee.
 Go. Go.
 Go. All right. Good. It sucks not having our own apartment.
 We got to get back in there.
 I know. I hate Dee. Dennis, I hate her. I know, but at least we got her out of our hair for a little while and we can finally do our plan. Yes, okay.
 Oh, goddamn it.
 What is that? Goddamn it! All right, look. Let's just deal with it, and then get back to business. Yeah, okay. All right, all right. I'm coming! I'm coming. Jesus Christ. Ugh.
 Hey, guys.
 What do you want, Charlie? We're busy. I wanted to apologize about, um, snapping earlier today with words at you guys, and then I came here to make an apology apology words.
 What's he talking about?
 I don't know. I don't remember. Okay, thank you. Hang on! Hang on a second. I got you guys a flower arrangement for you.
 Great. Thanks.
 You can't just have it. There's a plan. I have to come in and give it to you. And put it down. Fine. Come in, put 'em down and then go.
 Okay, I'm in.
 He's in. Okay. Uh Put the vase close to them, so we can see them. Right. Okay. And good. Where are you guys spending most of your time? It's a very small apartment. We're all over the place. Just put 'em anywhere. And I'll put 'em down right here then. No. No good. Move 'em. Can't put 'em here though.
 Where can I put 'em?
 Dude, any Put 'em in the trash for all we care. Putting 'em a little further back, so
 Yeah, that's good.
 And right about here. Uh, great. We don't care. It's fine. No, to the left.
 To the left, you say?
 Didn't say that.
 Don't talk out loud to me.
 Roger that.
 Who's Roger?
 Who's Roger? Just Thinking about legally changing my name to Roger. What's wrong with your ear, dude? Just A spider crawled up in my ear. It's living there. Right. Sends its thoughts to me. Is it telling you to leave? Spider, can I leave? Charlie, just a little to the left.
 Right there. That's good. Now get out of there.
 Okay. Oh, Jesus Chr
 Let's get back to business, please.
 Yeah, come on. I was doing a little research earlier, and I stumbled upon something huge. Hey, man. Can you hear and see everything?
 They're talking about research.
 Research, huh? It is everything that we've been looking for. Dude, it's gonna save us so much time. It is a game changer. Check this out.
 Oh, my God.
 Yeah. There's so much potential here.
 What is it?
 This is great!
 I can't see.
 Yeah, shit. So, listen, do me a favor. Give me a little time with this, okay? Let me dig into this, see what the potential really is. Yeah, I'll give you some space.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 Oh, and Mac.
 Yeah?
 One more thing.
 Mm-hmm? Throw those goddamn flowers in the trash. Yeah. Right. Pieces of shit.
 Goddamn it!
 Son of a bitch.
 We got to get our hands on that laptop.
 Right. Name's Dee. I'm new around here. So what's the deal with these masks, huh? Are they gonna protect you from the fish or protect the fish from you? Am I right? No. I didn't get that. You chop fish, pull gut! "Pull gut." Totally, yeah. Listen, I'm gonna pop this off 'cause it's not protecting me from the smell so I'm not really sure what its point is. Hey. Give me the skinny. Are you guys up to anything non-fish related around here or Seriously? All right, goddamn it. You are of no use to me. Oh, here we go. Uh, excuse me. Hello. Hi. Um Uh, my name's Dee, and I'm new around here and I just would love to chat with you sometime in private, you know? Maybe up in your secret private office up there? I need you to chop fish and pull the gut. Yeah. No, I get it. I get that you're a chop-fish, pull-gut factory. Wait, wait, wait! Don't go anywhere. Hi. Um Uh, how about this, huh? Uh-oh. What do you see, huh? American girl, blue eyes, blonde hair Aaah! It's got me! It's got me good! Aaah! It's in my mouth. It's getting in
 Hi. Hey, guys.
 What are you doing, dude?
 You texted us 911. What's the emergency?
 Yeah. Oh, yeah. Uh, well our friendship's in danger, so I stole Frank's credit card. You guys want to have lunch?
 You got Frank's card?
 I got the card. All right, I'm annoyed, but I could eat. All right, let's go. To be honest with you, my taste for fish is returning. I've been thinking about it all day. My taste for fish is slowly returning too. And Guigino's does have the best fish. Very well. You know, maybe just order a couple apps though. I think Frank would prefer that, you know Who cares what Frank prefers? We're buying this food with his stolen credit card. And I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that.
 Uh, welcome back, gentlemen.
 I'm sorry. Do I know you, pal?
 I've never seen this man before in my life.
 I waited on you before. You tied my shoelaces together. I fell down. I'm getting nothing. I'm drawing a blank on this guy. That means nothing to me. What are you saying? A scalding hot plate of spaghetti fell into my face? I'm to remember every man I've seen fall into a plate of spaghetti? Never mind. Uh, can I get your order?
 Get me the snapper, bozo.
 Snapper fish for the man. Actually, our fish supplier had an incident at their facility so we are limited on fish. Market price is quite high today. Do you have the snapper or not? Yeah, uh, we do. But it's $44. Ooh. Oh, my God. All right. Then let's do something cheaper. Chicken or, uh No, I'm in a fish mood now. Fish has been established.
 It was established, wasn't it?
 Yeah, it was. So three snappers. Why are we talking about it so much? Get the goddamn snappers.
 Okay.
 Get the snapper!
 Jesus Christ.
 Who is that guy? Guigino's is slipping. Slipping. It is. They are slipping. They do have great fish though.
 So, what's going on with our friendship?
 Yeah. Okay. Ha. Charlie, I'm in. How you doing? You having lunch? Keeping them busy? Uh, yeah. But slight hitch though. The snapper is, uh, $44. What? No, no, no, no $44. Get 'em appetizers. I know, but, like, they want fish, and I kind of want fish too and the waiter said it's the market price, so All right. Wait, I got the laptop. Let me go to the search history. Holy shit. Damn it. Sweeping up fish guts with a broom? Got to be some kind of workers' rights violation. What are you Aaah, you idiot! Are you picking it up with your hands? Uh, hell no, lady. No. Look, I realize this might all be moon talk to you but I'm not touching fish guts with my hands, okay? You know what we could do? Yeah, like just disperse it. You know what I mean? Just send it all over the place. Nobody will know. Just kind of There we go. Whoa, uh-oh. Lay off. I know. Yeah, it's so crazy. I saw that. Hi, Frank. Sweet hat and jacket.
 Don't Charlie, don't sit there.
 Huh?
 Sit back there. We gotta be smart about this.
 Yeah, all right. Why didn't we just meet back at the apartment? That would've been better. Because you got me thinking about fish. Oh, right, nice. Yeah, get the snapper. It's delicious.
 Mmm.
 Hi. How can I help you? Oh, perfect. You're here now too. You're talking to me like you know me. Have we ever met? Let's just move past this part. What can I get you? I'm gonna have the snapper. And I'm gonna buy one for the strange man behind me who I've never met. Gentlemen, I hate to inform you two strangers here that we are out of snapper. We had some issues with our local supplier so we are completely out of fish today. How do you not have fish? It says "Fresh fish daily" on the menu. Well, I just explained it. I went step by step. But how come you don't have it? It's on the menu.
 For the reasons I said.
 You have no snapper?
 The sequence of events
 It says here, "snapper."
 Do you have fish or not?
 Can I get you a non-fish entrÃ©e?
 You can get lost.
 With pleasure. All right, so, what did you find out?
 I think I know what those guys are up to.
 Can I just sit over there?
 I feel like the cover's blown now, and now I have to
 All right, sit over here.
 I think I know what they're up to.
 Okay, what? I think Mac and Dennis are going into business with the Chinese guys across the street.
 What?
 They're gonna open up some kind of pastry factory. What? What makes you think that? I saw it on their search history. Only two words came up "Asians" and "cream pies." Oh, shit. They're gonna turn Paddy's into some kind of Asian cream pie factory!
 Those bastards!
 Yeah!
 Oh, my God!
 Sons of bitches!
 What are we gonna do?
 Beat them at their own game. Okay, the Chinese want cream pies, they'll get cream pies. But only, they're not gonna get them from those bozos. They're gonna be getting their cream pies from us. Can I go now? I feel like you had a really long session last time. I did, yeah. I went on for a long time, but that's how much it takes. I'm trying to build up to something, to a major finish. And I didn't get to because Charlie interrupted us with his goddamn emergency lunch. What are you doing? I really don't want to stumble across whatever it is that you're stumbling across.
 Let me finish.
 Wait, no We got a problem here.
 What?
 The Internet's not working. What? No. No! Come on! Oh, son of a bitch. What is it, Charlie? We're in the middle of a crisis. Trouble getting online? Yeah, how did you know that? We need to talk. Hi, how can I help Oh, you're back. Why do you look familiar to me? I'm the waiter you didn't tip earlier. Yeah, well, you're not gonna get tipped again with that attitude. We'll take the snapper. Uh, this guy too. He's with us. Well, as I told this gentleman only moments ago, we are out of fish today. We came to Guigino's for the fish. It says "Fresh fish daily." Uh, you know what, Dennis? I'll have a plate of piping-hot spaghetti instead. Extra sauce. All right. You know what? That sounds good. I'll take spaghetti too. Nice and sloppy.
 So you do remember me.
 We're busy.
 He wants spaghetti. I want spaghetti too.
 He's gonna get spaghetti.
 Get us the spaghetti.
 And some snapper, if you have it. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
 What's that guy's attitude?
 I don't know what that guy's deal is. Hey, you know what we should do? We should tie his shoelaces together. Classic. When he falls, it'll spill all over. Yeah, the spaghetti will get on him. I've always wanted to see that. Can I come sit with you guys? I feel my cover's blown. You don't have a goddamn cover. You're dressed like it's Halloween.
 Come over here.
 I'm coming over.
 What's going on, man?
 What's going on? Listen, Frank's onto you. That's why I had Dee's Internet shut down. He knows what you're doing.
 Come on.
 Frank knows what we're doing? Yes. And honestly, guys, you should be ashamed of yourselves, really. What? I'm not ashamed. I'm a little bit ashamed, but I think that's natural. Look, here's the thing. Now Frank wants to start doing it too.
 So what?
 So what? Let him do it. Well, he wants me to do it with him.
 I assumed you two did that already.
 Me too. No! He wants us to do it with the Chinese guy across the street. I knew you wouldn't be into that. Well, no, I'm not into that. That's bizarre. Exactly. I feel like I should be doing it with you guys. Oh.
 Come on, man.
 This is getting weird and messy. I don't want to get you involved. There's too many people.
 Just go do it with Frank.
 Is Dee in on it?
 Ew! God, no!
 Come on. Why would we That's why she's at the factory, to distract her. Come on, guys. It should be you and me, okay? I like cream pies as much as the next guy. Oh, shh-shh Don't say it out loud. Okay, okay, okay. Let me make a cream pie for you, okay? Then you can try it. See what you think. I do not want to taste your cream pie. They taste great, I can guarantee it. You've tasted yours?
 Of course I have. Haven't you?
 No! I've tasted mine. I didn't like it.
 I've tasted mine, yeah.
 I-I liked mine. Whatever, dude. If you don't care about the taste, fine.
 But they're not just gonna be for us anyway.
 It's not What?
 We're gonna sell them to everyone in Philly.
 Who the hell's gonna buy 'em? Everyone's gonna buy 'em. Everyone loves them, especially little kids.
 Ew, dude!
 Little kids? I'd love watching a kid do it.
 Dude, you are gonna get in a lot of trouble.
 Hell, no, dude. It's not like I'm gonna do it without the parents' permission.
 No parent is gonna let you
 Where are you gonna go? The parents are gonna watch. They're not gonna watch! What are you talking about?
 We gotta go overseas for that. That's disg
 No. That's as American as it gets. You gotta think about this as a business venture. The three of us combining our ingredients making, like, one gigantic, delicious cream pie some little kid sucking it down, and he's paying us for the pleasure. Hang on a second. What kind of cream pie are you talking about? What kind of cream pie are you talking about? Everyone loves them. Comedians, baseball players, even protesters. Cream pies are a rich American tradition and also delicious. Mmm, my mouth's getting wet just watching her eat that cream pie. Asians know electronics. And fish. But Americans know cream pies except for them. God bless cream pies Look, I'm an experienced businessman with a long history in Asian countries. Imagine my cream pie taste and know-how combined with your underpaid labor force? We could corner the cream pie market. Wait. Wait just a second. It's, uh It's my business partner. Hello? I'm in the middle of the meeting now. The video killed. What do you mean, it's not the same kind of cream pie? Oh, wait. I'll look. Holy shit. Holy shi Well, it looks like relying on old Dee really paid off for you guys after all, huh? What are you talking about? My series of accidents shut the whole factory down for, like, a couple days. We never asked you to shut down the factory. That's what's been driving up the price of fish. Snapper's way up. Snapper's through the roof. Snapper's through the roof. We're out of snapper, Dee! I told you. You can't count on her. We stole our Wi-Fi from that place too. Did you know that? Now we got no Wi-Fi because of you. Actually, we're pretty dependent on that Chinese factory. We need the Chinese, Dee. We need the Yeah, for the cream, for the cr Don't Guys, you know what? She seems fine, and I'm not worried about her. Let's go discuss our research a little bit further, yeah? Ooh, for what? For what? For one of our next schemes? Yeah. Yeah. For the next scheme, Dee.
 Uh, we'll be in touch.
 Yeah. Oh, you guys could just do that here. Wait, I can call for more chairs. Listen, guys, uh, first of all I'm gonna suggest that we reset our browser each time we do a research session. That's a good idea. For privacy.
 Right.
 Yeah, no more spying on ourselves. That doesn't really gather any useful information.
 No, it's just all porn.
 Right.
 We should keep spying on the Chinese though.
 Oh, absolutely. When I was over there, I looked at their search history It's all porn too.
 Is it?
 Ah, we're all doing it. I think what you're gonna find when you're spying on the general population is that everyone is just, uh, masturbating constantly.
 I know I am.
 Yeah. And yet you've never heard of a cream pie. Happy New Year 2016
 New Year, New Color ;-)                        Happy New Year 2016
 New Year, New Color ;-) Turn this up. This is my jam. Shit! Did I miss the turn? Yeah, I think it was back there. Come on, man. You better hurry up or we're gonna miss that boat. Well, don't blame me. It took Dee a goddamn hour to get dressed like a man. Nah. Captain Barnacle. It's a great new character I'm working on. Arr!
 Give me another worm, Charlie.
 All right, coming up.
 You want rum or julep? That's a rum one.
 I'll take the rum one. You guys brought worms in here? Well, we kind of soaked them in alcohol and you suck the alcohol off of them.
 Ah.
 I ate mine. You're gonna ruin this! How often do boat parties come around, and with hot Main Line women? This is a classy event. It took me hours to get us invited to this.
 Uh-oh! There's the boat.
 Ah Aaah! Goddamn it! We missed it. Aw, this is great. This is exactly what I was worried about. Great, guys. Way to go. You know what? Screw it. I'm going in.
 What?
 Wh-What are you talking about?
 We're going in.
 Not in the water? Yes, we're going in the wa Look, guys, this car was built for this, okay? It's got air intake valves. This is precision British land-to-sea craftsmanship at work. We're going in. We are not missing that boat. What have we become? I mean, we have literally and figuratively missed the boat. I-I used to be a cool guy, right? With a cool car, hanging out all the time. And now I'm a What am I? I'm a chauffeur to a bunch of worm-sucking idiots! You? What about me? I used to be a party boy who banged chicks all the time. You guys remember. But no one was ever good enough for you, dude. So I got self-conscious and I stopped. Because of you, I changed who I am at my core! Mac Mac, that is not what happened, okay? You are completely delusional. I mean, by the way, all of us have become so goddamn weird. I think we're just hitting our stride.
 Oh, you think we're "hitting our stride," Frank? Really?
 Yeah! 'Cause Dee's in a goddamn costume every other day. As a matter of fact, we all are. I think we have more costumes in the bar than we do kegs. I mean, what-what if I said I wanted to become a man-cheetah right now? What would you do?
 I'd go get the spots.
 He's got spots! Why do you have spots? You shouldn't have spots. That's absurd, man. That's absurd. You know what? I actually
 I blame you for most of this.
 Me? Yeah, because you came in here with your endless goddamn supply of money and financed all this bizarre behavior. You were plenty weird before me. What about the underage drinking scheme? I wasn't even here for that. But that made sense, Frank. It worked. You know what? I gotta get away from you people. That's what it is. I-I-I fly off the handle every five seconds now. You know what? I gotta get away from you people. You're all insane! I'm storming out. What? Don't copy me. I'm the one who's angry. Goddamn it! You don't storm out on me. I storm out on you. I'm the one who storms out! I'm the one who Oh, oh, oh! Yeah, no, no. Okay. You know what? Yeah, that's fine. Storm out. Get angry. You guys be that guy, 'cause I'm not gonna be that guy anymore. I'm not gonna get angry and shit. I'm gonna cool off. I'm gonna go back to being what I was before. A cool guy who just hangs out and has a cool car. So I'm not gonna storm out, but I am gonna leave. I'm gonna leave casually. You want to get lunch?
 Sure.
 Yeah? When was the last time, like just you and me went out to eat?
 It's been a while, right?
 By ourselves?
 Yeah.
 I don't even know. It's nice to go to a diner too, you know?
 Like, I like diners.
 Yes.
 I appreciate a menu with pictures.
 It makes it easier. It's like, sometimes those guys make me do things
 that aren't really me, you know, like
 Yeah. Okay. I kind of feel compelled to call you a bird right now
 and throw my glass of water in your face.
 Right. But, uh, you know, I'm realizing that I only do that stuff 'cause I don't want the guys to do it to me first. You know what I was about to do? Pretend that I had to go to the bathroom. Then I was gonna sneak out the window and get out of here 'cause I was afraid you were gonna do that to me.
 Right, right, right.
 Isn't that weird?
 I was though. Yeah.
 Oh. Yeah. But again, I think it was only 'cause like, that's what the guys would've done and
 It's the peer pressure thing from those guys.
 Yeah. Right. Okay. Well, forget the guys today, right?
 They're not here. So, um
 Yeah.
 Like, what do you want to do?
 Uh, let's see. I'd like to order my food in a German accent.
 Right, right. Okay, cool.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 Why?
 I guess that's just I-I put all these expectations on myself to be funny all the time. You know? 'Cause that's what people have come to expect from me.
 Mmm.
 But that's not fair. It's too much pressure for me. Yeah, right. No, I don't think anyone expects that at all. Well, what about you? What do you want to do? Okay. Uh, well, I would like to get a chicken sandwich but, uh but I think I wanna get the beak on the side?
 Mmm.
 Frank's always making me eat it first and, frankly, I'd rather eat it last if I'm gonna eat it at all. Ooh, I can help you here. Instead of eating it last, you don't have to eat beak at all.
 Oh!
 Ready to order?
 Ooh!
 Yeah. Ja, well, uh, I would like the I'm sorry. I would like a chicken sandwich, please. Okay. And you?
 Beak! No.
 No! No.
 R-Regular chicken sandwich.
 That's it?
 That's it for him.
 Okay. You did it!
 You did it.
 God, I really wanted to say it.
 I saw that you wanted to say it badly.
 Yeah, yeah.
 All right, well, this is good.
 This is great.
 I'm very proud of you.
 This is really good. All right. Look at us! Cheers! Yeah. No beak. Bob, I want to thank you for answering my ad so quickly. Well, I really needed a car, and I always wanted a Range Rover. Yeah, well. Hey, I gotta tell you though. This is not just a car. This is a lifestyle. This is an Eddie Bauer edition. Tortoiseshell interior, supercharged twin cam European luxury sports-utility vehicle, my friend.
 Wow.
 Yeah. It's a classic, okay? The only reason I'm giving her up is 'cause I'm ready to turn a page.

 I'm thinking about getting an Alfa Romeo. What do you think? Two seats. Me and a babe. You like babes, Bob?
 Oh, yeah, sure!
 Yeah! Who doesn't like babes? Yeah. Yeah, it's a wonderful machine. I used it to traverse the plains of the Serengeti of my life. And now I want that for you, Bob. There she is. I'm sorry. Are you t-talking about the car in the river? Yeah. Well, it's an amphibious exploring vehicle, so You-You think you can pull it out of the river? No, no. What fun would that be? That's not my job. That's your job. I don't want to take that from you. You're gonna love it. Yeah, right, but I just I didn't bring a change of clothes or anything. That's not really my fault, is it? You know, I gotta say, uh, your line of questioning's starting to starting to annoy me. Oh, no, I'm sorry. I just, you know, I thought I was gonna see a car on land.
 You being cute right now? Is that what's happening?
 No.
 I'm not being cute.
 Then no sale! How about that? 'Cause you don't deserve the car. The car has spoken. I have spoken. You obviously don't get what's happening here. So be gone with you! All right. There's that anger coming up again. I'm getting weird and arch. But that's the gang's fault. That's-That's not me. I'm fine, see? I'm I'm calm, man. I'm cool as a cucumber. It's all good. It's all good. Talking to myself. But that's just 'cause I-I've got shit to say, you know? Oh, hey! Hey, I'm Mac, former party boy. Looking to get back into the party-boy scene. You want me to milk your adrenal gland? You'll go berserk. Eh? No? That's all right. Ugly anyway. You're gonna find that ass to crush. Yoo-hoo, Mac. Beat it, Frank. You're acting like it's 2006. Hey, listen, the hell with Dennis. Don't let him screw up a good thing that we got. Come on, we'll start our own crew. Beat it, Jabroni. Hey, look at that. Hmm? What? Oh, that? Is that what you want? I can get you all that you want. Maybe I've been thinking about this all wrong. You know, man? Maybe I've been lying to myself all these years. Maybe that's what I need. Well, we've always known that. Party boy, coming your way.
 Guys
 We did it. We did it. Opened a bar.
 Hey, gang.
 We pulled it off.
 Frank.
 Oh, hello. I just parted ways with my old crew, and I'm looking for a new one. I'm a financier. Of fun things, like schemes and pranks and such. You got anything? You interested? What? Uh, what are you celebrating? Uh, we-we just bought a bar together.
 You just bought a bar?
 Yeah. That is fantastic.
 That's perfect.
 Thanks. Next round's on me.
 Uh, thank you.
 Awesome. Cheers! You know, Mac and Dennis aren't here. They're not gonna ridicule us. We get to just pick whatever we want to do. Well, you know I like making music. Yeah, and I like listening to it but i-it hasn't really ever gotten us anywhere in the past. So, wh-what about poetry? I like poetry, but only if it's def.
 Def poetry.
 Yeah, like def poetry slams. Those are awesome. I love that. What happened to that? I don't know. Did people just stop thinking they were cool? That's crazy. Black people don't do stuff that's not cool.
 Yeah, so
 He doesn't deserve the car and that's the plain and simple of it.
 Are you crying?
 No, I wasn't It's humid outside, all right? That-That's why there's moist I don't have to explain myself to a worm-sucking idiot! Dee, where's the computer? I thought you were gonna try and control your rage. This is irritation, okay? There's a difference.
 And why are you irritated?
 I'm irritated because I'm having trouble finding a proper buyer for the Range Rover. I need to create a new ad to attract an appropriate buyer, all right? Not some asshole who's got a problem with the car being in a river. It's awesome that the car is in a river. I need someone who can see that. Arrogance, vanity, all over. He's underwater, like a Range Rover. I'm sorry, what is this? What are you doing?
 Def poetry.
 Don't do that. Makeup smearin'. No power steerin'. He be talkin', but we don't be hearin'. I command you to stop.
 Speaks like Zeus.
 Smells like poops. Rage all over from his head down to his shoes. Zeus, poops and shoes? Guys, you suck at def poetry. You know what? Announcement. I have an announcement to make, all right? Thank you for gathering for me. I'm wearing a mesh shirt, and it's totally sweet. You guys probably want me to burn it, but I won't. Now, I like this choice. I like the choices I've made. I like who I am, all right? But I realize I've been lying to myself over the past few years. And I'm done lying, okay? And I found someone who's gonna allow me to be me.
 Okay, good.
 Great! Finally.
 Let's do this.
 That makes sense. Let's get this over with.
 Let's talk about this.
 Yes! Guys, I'd like you to meet the love of my life, Dusty. Come on in, Dusty. Why did I have to wait in the hall? Oh, I was doing a thing for my friends. No, no, no, Dusty's a man. Where's Dusty? No, Dusty is a w-woman. Why would you think Oh! Because of the name. No, no, she's called Dusty because she's really into angel dust. I am super into angel dust.
 Does she have a dick?
 Why would you think she has a dick? Come on, wh-what was that whole speech about then? Oh, well, the last few years I've been settling for fives, you know and I've been giving you the 10s, okay? But then I realized, you know what? I can be a 10 guy too. I saw a 10, I went after a 10, and I got a 10! Let's go, Dusty. We don't need these turkeys. I'm gonna go slam ass. I'm gonna go bang this chick.
 What the hell is this?
 Anger bubbling like a pot.
 Gettin' hot.
 Gonna explode like a bomb in a toad. You mark my words. If you decide to get into def poetry, you are going to fail and bomb and gag and fail and bomb. It's That's just You know, but I don't care, man. That's cool. Do whatever you want, man. I-I'm a cool guy now, so I'm gonna grab this laptop. I'm gonna go make a new ad for my awesome Range Rover, which I'm gonna sell and then I'm gonna get myself an Alfa Romeo. You know? Just me and a babe. Just me and a babe. So, you guys do whatever you want. You like it? Come on.

You know, we really appreciated the drinks the other night but we-we've got to get to work. You gotta get a ferret down in the basement because Charlie says ferrets scare the shit out of rats. What are you talking about? What is Wh-Who is Charlie? You're Charlie. No, you're too tall. By any chance, do you have homosexual tendencies? For you, you could be Dee, but you're smaller.

 Unbroken.
 You're free.
 Shit, that's def. That's super def right there.

 Hey, here's a crazy idea.
 Hmm? Why don't we run out, go to an open mike night, like, right now?
 Right now? I'm scared.
 Yeah, Dee. No, I know, but, look, without Mac and Dennis like, constantly coming down on us, you're not gonna bomb. You're gonna do great. You know, I just feel like I'm feeling something.
 I'm totally feeling it.
 Something, like, crazy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I guess we make a really good

 Snap to. You better do it quick too. That kid looks sick as hell. Excuse me. Hi. You the guy selling the car? Uh, yeah. Y-Yes.
 Hi.
 Hi. Yeah, I might like to buy it. What do you want for it? Well, I was thinking somewhere in the ballpark of the original price but, uh, considering the circumstances I'm open to a reasonable discussion. All right. I mean, it is an amphibious exploring vehicle
 so it should be fine, right?
 Yes. Yes, absolutely. It's nice to talk to a reasonable man. Now, are you a sportsman? Because you look very fit.

 No, I know. I know. Hey! What's up, bitches? I'm a man-cheetah. You want to do something with this? We lost it. We lost our bar.
 Huh?
 Yeah. The health inspector called the police, man. The control board pulled our liquor license. And we got a $75,000 fine for serving minors. Well, uh, the other crew always had something up their sleeve. I got an idea. We don't want to hear your ideas. This is all your fault. Well, wait, Kelly. Maybe he can help us. It sounds like he's used to this kind of thing.
 Really?
 Yeah, th-that's true. He got us into this mess. Maybe he can get us out of it. Okay, old man. What's your plan? Where did

 New Year, New Color ;-) A tragic ferry accident today. Apparently a ferry rammed into the shoreline at full speed near a local power plant there. There are multiple fatalities and injuries reported at this hour. That's really depressing. And how do you lose control of a ferry? They're slow as shit.
 Guy must've been drunk.
 Yeah. Hey-yo! Check out my new threads. Picked them up at the airport.
 What were you doing at the airport?
 Just farting around.
 I found this shop full of this stuff. Look at that!
 Hoo! I got some for everybody. "Life is happy"? What the hell is that? Well, it's clothing that supports a positive message. I mean, you wear it, and you celebrate that life is happy, baby. In other news, a man is in custody for murder of a state witness who was brutally beheaded by an assailant wielding a stop sign. A man seeking justice is beheaded by a maniac with a stop sign.
 You're right, Frank. Life is happy.
 The suspect in custody is a 59-year-old repeat felon by the name of Luther McDonald. Holy shit! That's my dad! If convicted, McDonald could face the death penalty. Can you believe what they're saying about my dad having killed that guy?
 Mmm
 Yeah. Yeah, why wouldn't I believe that? No way. This has gotta be bullshit. He's innocent. I'm not gonna let the state kill him. I'm gonna save my dad's life. Thanks for coming. You're forcing me.
 Yeah, well
 I'm here. Of course. We gotta show support for my dad, right? Gotta let him know that we know he didn't do it.
 I know, but I believe that he did, so
 Well
 Are you gonna be cool?
 I'll be cool. As long as he doesn't ask us to shove heroin up our ass again
 I'll be cool.
 He might, and I might do it. You would enjoy it. Here he comes. Oh, here he comes. Oh, Dad! He looks great, huh? Dad! Dad! Hey! How are you? It's been so long! I brought a picture of Mom here just to make you feel more at home. She looks good, right?
 And, uh, what about me? How do I look? Do I look cool?
 Give it a rest.
 Do I look cool?
 What do you want? We just wanted to come by and tell you that we believe that there is no way that you did this. You didn't do it, right, Dad? No. Right. I knew it! I knew it. Another innocent man being railroaded by the system. Besides, there's no way that you could've done this. You have a bad shoulder, and that's why you could never have a catch with me, remember?
 Right.
 Yeah. Charlie and I want to let you know that we will not rest until you are proven innocent. Look, I got a lawyer appointed to me. It'll be fine. Uh, sorry. Mr. Mac, you really don't want to put your life in the hands of a public defender. I mean, those guys are absolute clowns. I tell you what. I'd be interested to take a look at your case you know, if you want a little outside help. I specialize in bird law mostly, but I know my way Stay out of this! Both of you! I do not want you stirring things up! You hear me? Yeah, I-I-I hear you, Dad. One last thing though. I love you. And I Oh, I love you! I love you, Dad!
 I love you! He can't hear me 'cause of this
 He definitely heard you.
 The glass is too thick.
 His ear was on the I think there's something wrong with that.
 Yeah. Sure.
 All right. We're now being told the ferry captain was intentionally trying to steer the ferry into the nearby power plant. The captain has tested negative for alcohol and drugs. The guy wasn't even drunk. This was a sober man purposely steering a ship into a power plant. God, the world is a very depressing place. You guys are depressing. I'm trying to enjoy my cone over here.
 Turn that crap off!
 Yeah, baby! There they are! The usual suspects. Pondy! Just the man I want to see. Now this man loves life. I'd love to get into some shots. Line 'em up, Frankie. Line them up! Now we got some positive vibes in here. You are his AA sponsor, right? Never change, Dee. I love it. Come on. Do a shot with me. Shot! Shot! I feel like a shot might make me feel better.
 I think I need a shot at this point.
 All right.
 Let's go, Frank. All right.
 To the brim! You're looking pretty dapper there, Bill. You hittin' it hard, or what?
 I'm celebrating today, baby.
 What's the special occasion? I'm gonna kill myself.
 What?
 Yeah, no, no. I'm gonna drink myself to death. Yeah, I botched it. Life, you know? Old B.P. Had a good run though, you know? It's like there's this tiny, little soul man in my body driving me around. That little soul man's ready to power old Bill down and move on to the next party monster. Oh, come on. You guys own a bar. You watch people slowly kill themselves every day, am I right? Keep it open. Charlie, this is a huge waste of time. No, no, no, no. This is standard procedure. They do this on every crime show. You know, the murder police come down to the scene of the crime. They find some blue-collar guy, and they talk to him while he's working. Let's just talk to this guy over here. He could know something, right?
 Why would he know anything?
 He's moving crates from one place to Will you just listen to me? All right? Excuse me, sir. Do you work here?
 Yeah.
 Please, don't stop your work. They never do on TV. Go ahead and place that bag down. Uh, now, are you familiar with the beheading that took place here last week?
 Are you a cop?
 No. But I do work on the behalf of the accused. I'm taking care of his interests and whatnot. This is his son, uh, Ronald.
 You're Luther's kid?
 Yeah. That's right, bozo. I'm willing to do whatever it takes to make sure he doesn't get the death penalty.
 Is that a threat?
 Why don't you tell us what you saw?
 I didn't see either of those guys.
 There was more than one guy? I said too much. I don't want any trouble. Then stop giving us trouble, and tell us if there was another guy.
 My lips are sealed.
 Then unseal them, or I'll unseal them for you! Hey, hey! What the hell are you doing? You can't threaten this guy.
 I wasn't threatening him.
 How do you not know what a threat sounds like?
 Oh, you mean the lips thing?
 Yes, the lips thing. He's got words in his lips. I needed to get them out. I know the words are in his lips. I saw them in there.
 Just let me coax them out.
 Okay. Otherwise you're gonna freak the guy out. Let me handle it. Sir, your lips are fine. I Great.
 That happens to us way too much.
 Yeah. I don't really care that much about Bill. I just don't want him dying in the bar.
 We've had too many deaths there.
 We should try not to have another one.
 Let's cut it off.
 We gotta show Pondy life is worth living. Right. Not really excited about Maureen being a part of this, but, yeah, we'll do it. Ah. Wh
 Hello, Dennis.
 Oh, God. Maureen, what's going on with your face? What have you done? I've had a few surgical procedures to enhance my natural beauty. You look like a cat. Yes, exactly. Cats are beautiful.
 Where are your breasts?
 Oh, they're in my face. Great. I don't really have time for this shit so have you gathered Bill's family for us? Me-yes. You kids remember Uncle Dennis? He came to talk to us about something important. Go ahead, baby.
 Yeah, uh
 Are you two getting back together?
 Oh, no.
 I think so.
 Mmm, no, never.
 Uh, okay. Um, listen, you guys. Your dad He needs your help right now. He's in a pretty tough spot. I don't call him "Dad." I call him Mr. Cocksucker, 'cause he sucks so many cocks. Weird. Uh I'm not going to call him that, okay?
 I'll just refer to him as "Bill," I guess, from now
 Yeah. Okay, so, listen. Here's the thing.
 He is in our bar right now drinking himself to death.
 Oh, that's fantastic. What? No, that's not fantastic. The man's trying to kill himself.
 If he dies, we get money.
 When I get my money, I want to buy a new cell phone.
 I'm gonna buy a gun, because I'm the man of the house.
 Oh, shit, no.
 This kid should not have a No, no. Please.
 No. We're trying to show Bill that life is worth living.
 Your dad loves you.
 No, he doesn't.
 Oh. Yeah.
 Has he not said it?
 Because I'm telling you, he just
 He does. No. He told me. He said, "I do not love you. You're a punk." He called me too fat to be a slut and tried to serve me an omelet with cocaine in it. Listen, guys. This is about forgiving Bill, your dad.
 Okay? It's not about blaming him.
 No. I blame you too. You and the other hookers he slept with.
 Hold on. I'm not a hooker. I never have been.
 Well
 You're a hooker.
 You're a fat slut! Oh. Oh, okay, all right. Hey, hey, hey. And you you ruined his sister with the divorce, and look at her face.
 She looks like a cat!
 Cats are magical. I kind of like it. I mean, maybe you could get some fur.
 Oh, I like that idea.
 What are you talk No!
 Think you could do a tail?
 Don't see why I couldn't do a tail.
 D-Don't. No.
 You could go full cat and start wearing humans on your sweatshirt. No one is turning themselves into a goddamn cat with my money! Can we focus here? Let-Let's Let's get back to showing Bill that life is happy. Bill's a lying, cheating, drug-addict piece of garbage, and we all hope he dies. Yeah. Hey, Dad. Hey, um, so I-I I know you told us to stay out of it but but we found out that there was another guy. Also, we got a stop sign and re-created the murder and there's no way you could have swung that. I jacked my shoulder up a bit too. Do you realize what you've done? Yeah. No. I told him, Mr. Mac. I said, "Hey! Stealing a stop sign, that's a felony." And as your counsel, I did advise against it. I'm talking about you going to the crime scene. Word's out my son is intimidating witnesses. Now that makes me look like I'm guilty.
 Oh.
 Oh, yeah.
 Your dad'd be a good lawyer.
 His idea. But the point is, we found out that this other guy exists. All we need to do is get his name, and I can rat on him. Do not be a rat! Stop trying to handle it or I am going to have to handle you. Okay? Okay, Daddy. Oh.
 I love you, Dad.
 Let it go. Let it go.
 It's just I thought maybe
 Yeah.
 It's not broken.
 No.
 Yeah, it's working fine, isn't it?
 No, it works.
 He seemed a little upset.
 All right, plan "B" here.
 Tsk, tsk, tsk.
 I got an idea. Why don't we check the guest record, right, because maybe that guy came to visit my dad?
 Oh, the other guy signed in?
 Yes. Uh, that's a good point. Luther McDonald visited by Bonnie Kelly holy shit!
 Well, that's the same name as my mom.
 It is your mom. Nah. I'm sure there's plenty of Bonnie Kellys. They probably all sign their name with those weird, squiggly lines and Cursive? Are-Are you talking about cursive, dude? Uh, "cursing"? Cursive. Everybody can under Okay, look, doesn't matter. We have to figure out why she came to visit my dad. And why is she signing my mom's name? Goddamn it. Goddamn it.
 Hey!
 Bill, we want to talk to you. Hey, you guys see this? There was another ferry that ran into the power plant. Copycat crime.
 Hilarious, right?
 No! No. There are black and white areas in life, Bill, and that's a black area. Look, turn it off. We want to focus on the positive in life now, Pondy.
 Which is why we're all wearing these ill-fitting T-shirts.
  Yeah.
 We wanna show you some reasons why life is worth living.
 Yeah. And, Dennis, you're up.
 Okay, so I like a good mani-pedi.
 Oh. Yeah, I like a good, healthy nail. I love one. You know, you get your nail beds clean.
 Get your cuticles pushed back.
 Oh, yeah.
 Get your hangnails all trimmed up
 That's great.
 By one of those nice ladies over there.
 A lot of those are sex workers. Yeah, the gals at the nail salon They're prostitutes. They're trafficked in, usually in shipping containers. They're, like, crammed in there, you know, like sardines shipped with sardines sometimes.
 Oh.
 It's ugly. But the point is those ladies doing your nails probably tugged a guy off right before you.
 They ship 'em in in shipping containers?
 Yeah. That's depressing as hell.
 Goddamn!
 All right.
 Dee. You. You're up, yeah.
 Me? Yeah! Hey, Bill, you know, for me, uh really it's just the simple things that I like in my life like a moonlight walk or a cozy, warm nap. Or a delicious, ripe piece of fruit, you know?
 Oh.
 Mmm. You know, sex workers use fruit during the act.
 What?
 Yeah. Yeah, well, citrus masks the taste of a dirty penis. In fact orifice before it reaches the market. Okay. Okay. I'm done.
 He's ruined fruit for me, so I'm done.
 You made fruit depressing. All right, well, I got this. Okay. All right, what makes me happy is, like, you know at night, a ride around town in a limousine, partying, having a good time. When I'm on my way home, I'll pass a bum. I take a balloon with some champagne in it, lob it out and bean him. He only gets a little in his mouth. Doesn't get the whole thing.
 Right.
 Not even a full sip of it. And you say "Hey, how do you like a taste of the good life, you sack of shit?" God. That is awful!
 That is a horrible thing to do to another human being!
 Goddamn you! Get over here, Frank. Get over here.
 Okay, that's it. I'm done.
 Well This is depressing as shit. I'm not doing this anymore. In fact, I'm starting to think that his family was right. You guys, what if we took out a life insurance policy on the guy? If he's gonna do it anyway, we might as well make money off of it.
 Hmm, that's dark.
 Yeah, I know. But can you take a life insurance policy out on anybody?
 Does it work that way?
 Mmm, it's a gray area. But I think I got a guy, I could twist his arm, we can get one. I say we embrace the gray area of life, okay, because what we're doing is not working. What, the state can murder somebody without them even wanting to die but a grown man can't kill himself if he wants to?
 A man should be able to end his life
 He's a grown American man.
 We're American.
 Ah, to hell with him. We tried. I give up. Great, great. Glad you're on our side.
 You're a terrible sponsor, by the way.
 Yeah. Okay, so why were you visiting Luther, Mom?
 I went to go
 She don't know nothin' about nothin'. Look, we know there was another guy in on this, all right? So, come on. Anything you can give us. He was staying here for a few months. He was here for a few months? Mom, why wouldn't you tell me that? Well, was he here on the night of the murder? Uh, no. Mom, don't lie, okay?
 Okay, yes.
 Quiet, Bonnie.
 No, no.
 Mom, if you know something, you gotta tell me. I can't lie to my Charlie.
 Good! Tell me everything.
 Okay. They were both here. They were both inside me. Eduardo was in my mouth, and Luther was in my butt. Oh, my God, no. Don't tell me everything. What? No! What? Damn it, Bonnie.
 Eduardo who?
 Sanchez. Holy shit. Tell us more. Then Luther went in Eduardo's butt for a while. Tell us less. Tell us less. Then they both "completed" on each other. I was left out of the finale. And then Eduardo went out and then he killed somebody, and then Well, that's all I know. Jesus goddamn Christ, Mom. If you know that, just say that. Don't tell me the whole thing about banging every guy that comes in the house. If you know about the murder, just say the murder part!
 Oh, my God!
 Oh, my God. This is crazy. You guys know what this means? That my father was trying to establish dominance. That's the reason he was in his butt
 What Why are you focused on that?
 It's about power.
 We have our guy now.
 I feel we should make that known
 that it's about power.
 Let's not make any of it known.
 We gotta go to the police.
 Don't be a rat. All right, look, Mrs. Mac. We're not gonna rat, all right? We're gonna figure something else out. Good? Okay, you're off words again. Great. And, Mom, don't bang every guy that comes into the house. How 'bout that? Okay, I won't, sweetie. Okay. It is my gift to you. This is This is great. Thank you. Guys, guys, guys. We've had a major break in my dad's case.
 What's Ponderosa doing here?
 Oh, he's gonna drink himself to death.
 So we took out a life insurance policy on him.
  Oh, cool, yeah.
 Pretty dark though, right?
 We've been over this.
 Don't worry. We're okay.
 We've justified this. Move past it. Fair enough. Turns out Mac's dad didn't kill the guy. No, there was another man in on this. It's gonna look bad if I rat on this man, Eduardo Sanchez, so I can't say his name.
 Uh
 You just did. You just ratted him out. You said his name. By the way, another guy being there doesn't mean your dad didn't do it.
 He might've done it with the other guy.
 Oh, no, uh
 my dad established dominance over this man.
 Well, let's not get into that.
 What does that mean?
 What's this? There was some weird prison sex going on. He may have been a power bottom. Bottom line, he talked his lover into doing the murder.
 Not his lover, his prison bitch.
 Oh. Hey, what if I confess? Hmm? What? Yeah, I could take my own life while saving your dad's. Everybody wins! Well, yeah, except everyone would think that you decapitated a man with a stop sign. Ooh, even better! Oh, that'll really embarrass the wife. I like where this is going, but I gotta bring something up here. Um, if you were to do that And I don't want to be crass or, you know
 but how would that affect the
 Yeah.
 We still get the money.
 Yeah?
 I bought the most expensive policy I could.
 Great.
 Let's go confess, baby!
 Yeah. I can't I'm sorry. I just I don't get how it's dominant if they finished on each other.
 How's that dominant?
 It's not. It's dominant because he finished first. Then he allowed Eduardo to finish.
 You're making that up.
 Oh, there's Bill.
 Here we go.
 Hey. Well, I did it. I confessed. Why aren't you in handcuffs then? Weirdest thing I'm sitting in the interrogation room you know, sobering up a little, looking at myself in the two-way mirror and I kept reading this shirt. Yeah. Yeah, I started thinking, "You know what? Life is happy. I want to live!" Then what did you confess about? Eduardo Sanchez. That guy you were talking about? Turns out he's some big gang member they've been after for years. Yeah, your dad's innocent. Holy shit, my dad's gonna get off. That means I'm a hero! I did it!
 Dad Dad, we did it.
 We did it. Yeah, we did it! They're gonna nail this Eduardo Sanchez guy, and you're gonna walk free.
 I saved you.
 Saved me?
 Yeah.
 You buried me. Now everyone in here thinks I'm a rat. They're gonna kill me in here. Because of you. I'm-I'm sorry. I still love you. I don't. Well, he definitely heard you.
 Snitch!
 You know, he can he can hear you. He didn't mean that though. He was just upset. Happy New Year 2016
 New Year, New Color ;-)                        Happy New Year 2016
 New Year, New Color ;-)
 This is so exciting.
 Is this the greenroom? Yeah. A game show. Can you guys believe we're gonna be on a game show?
 All right, all right, relax.
 Awesome! Guys, the greenroom of Family Fight. I've got goose bumps. Yeah, all right, calm down. Don't start acting like an animal here. All right, listen, this is Family Fight. This is a nationally televised program. This is a very big deal for us, okay? We're talking What are you doing?
 Are you stealing an ashtray right now?
 Yeah. Why? We have ashtrays, and you don't even smoke. This is a perfect place for me to lay out my political agenda. No, no, no. No politics, man.
 Why?
 Because it's too polarizing, okay? And don't be misogynistic and please don't be gross. I mean Guys, let's let's be smart about this. Let's be right down the middle. Right down the middle sounds so boring. That's not what the audience wants to see. Thinking I'm gonna do a Jenny McCarthy thing where I'm, like, super sexy, but I got a potty mouth. Ah, no, no. Dee, you are never going to be sexy. And do not do a potty mouth thing, okay? We don't want to come across as lowbrow animals. Now, have some veggie platter and have some fruit, okay? That is brain food. Mm-mmm, no way, not me. Haven't eaten in three days. I don't want to be puffy. J-Mac's face, it's never puffy. Yeah, because J-Mac's face is stapled to the back of her head. Now eat some food. You look emaciated and sick.
 What is that?
 Fart noise key chain.
 Dennis, what is this enticing bowl of white?
 This? Charlie, that that's cottage cheese. Cottage cheese? Like cheese from some cottage? Whose cottage? Well, what is that exactly? How do you not know what it is? Aren't you, like, a cheese guy?
 I'm not a cottage guy.
 You are gonna make us lose this game. Here comes the other family. Hello. You must be the Reynolds family. I'm Janet, and we are the Barretts. Oh. Okay. Hey, guys! I'm Lisa. I'm the stage manager. Both teams ready? Let's play Family Fight! Let's give it up for your host
 Grant Anderson!
 How you doing, man? Hi! Ah! Hello! All right! Thank you for coming out, everybody, and welcome to Family Fight. I'm your host, Grant Anderson. Today, we have the Barrett family! Oh, all right. Versus the Reynolds family! And they are here for a whole lot of cash, so let's get it on! Give me Janet, give me Frank. Here we go. Oh, whoa!
 Oh, I didn't get a good look at you before backstage.
 Sha-booyah, roll call. Whoo! Okay, all right, we got some some sparks flying already here. But let's get up here and do this.
 Come on, Frank, you ready?
 I'm ready. All right, man. Top four answers on the board here. Name an animal that we eat but doesn't eat us.
 Frank!
 Pig! Show me pig! Oh, all right! All right! Oh, Frank's doing a little dance there. Ha!
 Now, Frank, you want to pass or play? Pass or play?
 Oh, we Play, play, play. We're gonna play. All right, so, Frank You want to tell me
 a little bit about your family?
 Yeah.
 Well, yeah, you know, uh, Grant?
 Yes, Grant. I want to I want to change my answer.
 What?
 What? Why? I have realized it's-it's not totally accurate because I've seen a pig eat a man. In fact, I've seen many pigs eat many men. It was a bloodbath. Well, okay, well, we can't do that. I'm gonna move on though 'cause you're losing me. Yeah. Oh, Grant.
 A lighthearted barb, if you will.
 Sure, uh, sure. His talk of pigs and man flesh is confusing as it is frustrating. Right.
 Don't you just wanna
 I hear you, I hear you, Dennis.
 You have these people in your life and you just wanna
  Yeah. Now, Dennis, why don't you tell me something? What do you do? Me? Oh, well, I am the proprietor of, uh
 one of the most charming pubs in all of South Philadelphia.
 All right.
 Paddy's Pub.
 Paddy's Pub!
 Paddy's Pub.
 Paddy's Pub. Yeah. Yeah, but listen, I am so much more, Grant.
 Um, I'm kind of a jack-of-all-trades, if you will.
 Okay. So the question really isn't "What do I do?" It's "What don't I do?" Wow. Now, there's a lot of confidence right there. I like that.
 I like that, Dennis. All right.
 What a guy. Buddy, can you name an animal that we eat but doesn't eat us? Ah, easy. Uh, sea urchin.
 Uh, what now?
 Sea urchin.
 Sea urchin.
 Yeah. Okay. Show me sea urchin! Ooh, one strike.
 Oh.
 One strike for the Reynolds here. Wow, that, uh that buzzer sounds It's awfully loud.
 It is loud.
 Pierces you right down to your soul, doesn't it? I don't like it. I'll be fine though. It's cool.
 You're right. All right, thank you.
 Okay.
 Who do we have here?
 Hi. Hello, Deandra
 Yep.
 Reynolds. Deandra, help me out. Name an animal that we eat but doesn't eat us. Well, Grant, I'll tell you what
 Mm-hmm.
 I like to eat cock. I'm sor Whoa, no, no, no, no, no.
 No, we can't say
 Yeah.
 Lisa, are we gonna
 See what I did there? It's a little bit of a double entendre type of thing. I was talking about chicken, but I said "cock." Yeah, don't say that word. Please, I'm-I'm Just, it's a family show. So we're just gonna go with "chicken," okay? Show me chicken! There you go.
 Okay. Ronald Reynolds.
 Yeah!
 Hello, sir.
 Hey!
 How you doing today?
 I'm great, Grant. I'm just really excited to be here with my new family.
 Oh Your new family?
 Yeah.
 Oh, a little bit of background.
 Yeah, yeah. Uh, actually, just for for clarification. Um, he raised them, but he didn't sire them. Now, he may have sired him we're not exactly sure
 but they do live together in squalor.
 Yeah, yeah. I brought my blood bucket in case you guys want to run his blood and see if it checks out.
 It'd be good to know.
 Yeah, if we want to do a quick DNA sequencing at the commercial break, that actually would clear things up for everybody.
 If we could.
 It would set the record straight. Either way, I was always the odd man out, you know? I mean, you know. And then Frank here adopted me. And now I'm a part of the Reynolds family!
 Yeah. Yeah.
 Okay, well We don't I'm-I'm just
 I'm not even gonna try to figure that one out, so
 Okay, here's the deal, guys. From now on
 I'm not gonna ask you guys any more questions at all
 Yes! Other than the ones that keep the game moving.
 Great! Yeah!
 All right? Great! Show me cow! Nope, that's me. I say that word. I say the "show me" part. You just give me the answer.
 Okay, Ronald?
 Right, I'm sorry. Show me co
 Don't say "show me." Don't say it.
 You just said that.
 Just say the answer.
 Show "Show me"  is the part I say? Here's the one thing There's only one thing in the whole world "Show me." So just give me the answer, and then I'll say sh You know what, go ahead and do it. Just go ahead and do it then.
 Do what?
 Mother of Show me cow! Cow!
 Okay, well?
 Good answer. So, sadly we gotta stay here. Okay.
 Charlie.
 Yeah?
 Just need you to name an animal
 Yeah! That we eat but doesn't eat us. "Doesn't eat us." That's easy. Dragon!
 Charlie, do you eat dragon?
 No! I don't eat dragon 'cause, uh, it's-it's not a meal for peasants it's a meal for kings, and I'm sort of a common man. But they don't eat us. They, uh It's, like, a misconception. They actually eat gold and treasure.
 That's why they're always sitting on a big pile of it.
  Bad answer.
 Bad answer.
 Bad answer.
 Bad answer.
 That's a bad answer. Okay, show me dragon!
 I told you!
 Oh, my God! Well, astonishingly, uh, one person surveyed gave the answer "dragon," so What a world! All right. The Reynolds family has won round one! There you go, all right.
 Sha-booyah! Sha-booyah!
 All right. But we got a lot more show to go! It could be anybody's game. We'll be right back after this with Family Fight! That's commercial, guys! Back in three. Yeah!
 We nailed it.
 Yeah, that was, uh that was terrible. We're bombing out there. This-This is exactly what I was trying to avoid, guys. What are you talking about? We won that round. Yeah, but you were being lascivious and disgusting. Dee was making sex jokes that were going over like a lead balloon.
 At least we got all of our answers right.
 Yeah, that's utterly ridiculous. I mean, how is dragon an answer and sea urchin isn't? Everyone knows I don't know, but there's always a weirdo or two in those panels who's gonna give a stupid answer, and Charlie's always gonna get those, right?
 So
 Yeah, I'll get the steal.
 Yeah.
 Plus, people don't even really eat sea urchin, Dennis. Most people don't eat dragons.
 Well, dragonflies.
 People don't eat dragonflies. Don't make that noise. I don't like it. Just relax, would you, Dennis? If we make asses out of ourselves, they just won't air the episode. Okay, first of all, you don't know that. And secondly, don't tell me to relax. All right, don't you start making that noise. It's not funny when they do it. It's definitely not funny Oh! Ooh! Oh, goddamn it! And welcome back to Family Fight. We got the Reynolds family over here with 100 points. We got the Barretts over here with zero. Give me Bobby, give me Dennis! Here we go! Okay. Oh, hey, Bobby, all right. All right, somebody got a little a little lead in his shoes. No. No. No, my shoes are fine. I assure you. They're made of the finest Italian leather. The fit is perfect. Therefore, there would be no room for lead. All right. Top four answers on the board. We asked a hundred people on the street, "Name something people groom themselves with." Dennis!
 Laser beams, Grant.
 La-Laser beams. Yeah, laser beam. It's the only way to completely obliterate the follicle. Show me laser beam!
 Ooh!
 Oh, yeah, yeah. That noise, it's too loud. Can we Can we just turn it down a touch? We cannot, we cannot. Bobby, you got an answer?
 I got an answer.
 All right.
 Hair brush!
 Show me hair brush! Okay, we want to play! Hair brush, that's so obvious. God, that buzzer noise! Isn't that just irritating as hell?
 We gotta think of a steal here.
 I got one! What about bleaching cream for your facial hair?
 What the hell?
 No, no.
 I-I got it Drakkar Noir.
 Mmm, too specific. You know what it is? I think it's a bride. A bride could be a good answer.
 Show me clippers!
 What? You can't become a groom or get groomed without a bride.
 Oh, no.
 Right, right. That's not the kind of grooming they're talking about.
 I don't know. Charlie could be right.
 Yeah. I got dragon. No, he's not He's not right. Because nobody else is that stupid. Show me pumice stone! All right, here we go. Reynolds family for the steal!
 No, no, we're not gonna say that.
 The comb, a comb! I'm gonna go with toe knife. Wi-With what now? With a toe knife, 'cause I I use a-a a sharp blade to dig the scum out of my toenails. Once in a while, I cut myself but it "puses" up, and in three days, it's good as new.
 Sure.
 Toe knife!
 Way more information than we needed, but, uh
 Show me toe knife. The Barretts win the board! There you go! All right! Okay, let's see what see what that last answer was. Bride!
 Charlie was right.
 I knew it. Do you Do you groom a bride, Lisa? All right, hey, let's get on to that last round now! I need some Dee, I need a little bit of Lester! Come on down!
 Okay.
 Come on, Dee! All right.
 Okay, here we go. Top six answers are on the board.
 Name something that people are afraid of.
 Oh!
 Whoa! Oh! Oh, oopsie-daisy! Looks like I I broke it.
 You think?
 Oops. Can't believe Ain't never seen anything like that in my life. What, do you got hands made of anvils? You want me to answer that or answer the this one?
 I don't want you to answer either of them, okay?
 Yeah, sorry. Because I don't know who won because you broke the machine.
 That makes sense. It makes sense, yeah.
 Right? Okay? Okay. Everybody, we're gonna take a couple seconds.
 We'll be right back after this.
 Okay. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh! Start thinking of a steal, because if we get this one, we win the game.
 All right, all right. What's the question?
 Things people are afraid of.
 That's still the question?
 Yes. How do you not know how the game works by now? Okay, I'm afraid of game show rules.
 You guys, I know what it is.
 Yeah?
 It's failure.
 That's too pathetic. Liberal yahoos taking my guns. That That is a political firestorm, Frank. No! Oh, oh! The Nightman. All right, guys, these are terrible answers, all right? Now, normally I would've said the crust on a crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e burning the top of your mouth but I'm thinking like a commoner now, and I really do think that the right answer is probably clowns.
 That's a good answer.
 I know.
 I feel it could be Nightman.
 No, I feel like it isn't the Nightman He could be right, dude. Show me dogs! God No. Okay, Reynolds, you get a chance to steal and win the whole game right here.
 Okay. All right.
 Name something that people are afraid of. We're gonna go with Wait, wait, Frank. You have to say it in the form of a question.
 What is it
 No, you don't, you don't You don't have to do that 'cause it's not Jeopardy!
 Ah, it's not Jeopardy!
 All right? Say "show me," Frank. Don't say "show me," Frank. Just say the word. Just say the word.
 Show me clowns.
 Show me clowns! We did it! We did it! And the Reynolds win the game! The Reynolds win the game! Sha-booyah, sha-booyah, sha-booyah, you lose! Sha-booyah, sha-booyah, sha-booyah, you lose! Woo-hoo! All right, okay. So, anyway Let's take a look at the last one, everybody. Nightman. Don't know what that is.
 Just don't know what it is.
 What is happening? Pretty strange answers today! All right, man. We're gonna come right back and play some Fast Money.
 How the hell was "Nightman" an answer?
 Right. Dude, I think I'm remembering what happened. I took this survey. I got interviewed at a mall and I thought it was, like, a government thing.
 Okay, all right.
 That makes a lot more sense.
 That's actually the only thing that makes sense.
 Right? Okay. So I should play Fast Money, because I'm gonna know all the answers. No, no, no, you're only gonna know your answers. And that's only gonna get us one point for every question.
 We need to get all the top answers to win Fast Money.
 Right, totally, totally.
 And then we spin the wheel.
 Okay, you're definitely not gonna play
 'cause you can't understand a thing that's happening.
 I'll play. No, you won't play, because you've been nothing but gross and foul and polarizing the entire time.
 You're embarrassing me in front of the whole nation. Dee
 Mmm.
 You and I are gonna play.
 Yeah?
 Mm-hmm.
 Can I do my fart key chain? Absolutely goddamn not. Now go get something to eat. You look terrible. No, no, no. I'm very hungry, but I'm not gonna blow it now. This is my close-up. Oh, God, don't be a dumb, hungry bitch the entire time.
 Guys, we're back.
 Ooh! All right, you're going first, Dee.
 You're going first.
 Come on, Dee! Go, Dee! All right, we are back with Fast Money, here with Dee Reynolds. But first, there's somebody who wants to say something to you. Yeah? Hey, Reynolds family! Win 20,000 and bring home the money for Paddy's Pub! Yeah, all right.
 I'm done dancing like a monkey. Give me my five bucks, Charlie.
 Ha-ha, wow! That was a rough video right there. That dude is hard on the eyes. Yeah. He's all burned up.
 We couldn't get anybody else?
 No.
 Okay, you ready, Dee?
 Oh, you better believe it.
 But, uh
 Mm-hmm? First, hold on a hold on a second.
 Yeah?
 There's, um
 There's, uh Ooh!
 You okay?
 Yeah.
 You all right? Uh, yes. There's a Just a quick bit I wanted to, uh
 Oof.
 Oh! Oh, whoops-a-daisy. That's about as lowbrow as it gets. Yeah, Dennis isn't gonna like that.
 It's pretty funny though.
 Okay, new plan. All right.
 This is so good.
 Yeah. So we're back here with, uh, Fast Money here. Uh, and now we got Frank doing it, 'cause people just be faintin' up in here, so Okay, give me 30 seconds on the clock.
 Name something you thought existed when you were a child.
 Santa Claus.
 Name something you might find in a bathtub.
 Soap!
 Name something people add sugar to.
 Coffee.
 A thing you associate with Charlie Chaplin.
 Little mustache.
 Name a foreign country whose films are popular in America.
 France. Damn! You did it, man! That was great!
 Yeah, man! That was really good!
 That was so good, Frank!
 Hey, you ready?
 Yeah, I'm ready.
 Frank did great.
 Frank?
 Yeah, uh, Dee passed out.
 She
 Of course she did. She's so embarrassing.
 Right. All right, here we go, everybody. We're gonna bring Dennis out right now. Here he is, Dennis Reynolds.
 Here we go.
 Yeah, Dennis! All right. Okay. Now, Dennis Frank got the number one answer for every single question
 so you only need five points to win the game.
 Okay, I can do it.
 Now, Grant, listen, I know I gave some bad answers before.
 Yes. But I understand the game perfectly now, and, uh, that does not represent me.
 I like that.
 So I'm ready to give good answers.
 I like that.
 That does represent me. All right, that sounds good. If you repeat any of Frank's answers you're gonna hear this sound.
 Mm-hmm. And then
 Thought we were done with the buzzer.
 Oh, only if you repeat an answer.
 Even in this round? Yes, even in this round. Yep. Mm-hmm. If you don't know an answer, you can say "pass"
 and we'll just move on to the next question.
 Okay.
 All right, are you ready?
 Yes, yes. Thirty seconds on the clock.
 Name something you thought existed when you were a child.
 Santa Claus. Oh, God. Uh, pass.
 Name something you might find in a bathtub.
 S Uh, soap. Ah! God, I really hate that buzzer.
 Can we not do that?
 Clock's ticking.
 Okay, uh, pass.
 Name something people add sugar to. God. Coffee.
 Oh, God.
 No, no.
 Nope, we gotta We need an answer.
 Yeah, no, no. Okay, no, then pass, then pass, 'cause
 A thing you associate with Charlie Chaplin.
 Mmm Pass. Mm-hmm. Okay, name a foreign country whose films are popular in America. France.
 Oh, God, no, no!
 Already said that. Oh, God, France. France
 That's still not the answer.
 Little mustache. Soap, soap, France.
 Say something!
 Go with something else! You said that already. Don't say "France."
 Give up.
 All right. I have never seen a more embarrassing display in my entire career. Oh, but please don't air this. Okay? Please don't don't air this.
 You won't air this, right?
 We definitely air it. We always air it.
 No matter what. That's how we do it.
 But this went so wrong. Good night, everybody! Thanks for joining us here on Family Fight!
 This doesn't represent me.
 Take care.
 Ah, God!
 Why'd they have to air that part?
 That was the end part.
 The best part. Yeah, they air the whole show. This doesn't represent me though. This doesn't represent me. That's not who I am. So just So just don't air it.
 It's the buzzer that was
 This doesn't represent me. So just don't air it! Happy New Year 2016
 New Year, New Color ;-)                       Happy New Year 2016
 New Year, New Color ;-) We think it's a sinkhole! It's awesome!
 It's not that awesome.
 It's blowing my mind! How is a hole in the ground blowing your mind? I was a little skeptical at first too but we've been playing with this thing for three hours now, and it's fantastic. Can I ask, how do you play with a goddamn hole? First, we started just, like, throwing things down it, and then we never heard it land. It would just kind of rattle around down there. Then we got a flashlight to see if we could see the bottom. We couldn't. Then I threw it down there to prove a point.
 What was the point?
 It was something to do with how metal travels faster than light or No, it was that light is either on or off. There's no speed to light. It's It was an antiscience thing. This hole, it's very exciting, Dennis. I mean, it represents infinite possibilities. It's endless. What if there's a mutant living down there? We can get him up. He can live in the bar with us. We've already got one mutant hanging out with us in the bar all the time. Hey, Frank, did you hear what I said? I turned a frustrating conversation into a joke on you.
 The, uh thing.
 Huh? Oh, y-yeah. Frank, what do you think about this hole? Pretty cool, huh?
 You want to do something with it?
 No. I don't. In fact, something just dawned on me. I need to quit. What What? What are What are you talking about? I don't care anything about this hole. I-I-I'm passionless. What are you saying, Frank? I hereby officially retire from Paddy's Pub. Yeah! All right, now, with Frank retiring I know we're all a little bit concerned about how that affects everyone's shares. Frank owned 51% of Paddy's Pub, and we owned 46%. Well, we did, not not Dee. She doesn't own shit.
 Yeah, I know. Goddamn it.
 Yeah, yeah. And, Charlie, you actually gave up most of your shares for various sandwiches and snacks and sundries and things. What the hell is a Franquito? It says Franquito owns three percent of Paddy's Pub? Oh, yeah. I don't know. That's probably one of Frank's weird shell corporations. It doesn't matter. Who gives a shit? It's only three percent. Whoever gets Frank's 51% is the majority shareholder. That is who controls the bar. That is who gets the throne. Oh, there's a throne? Oh, sorry. No, I was just referring to the desk chair as the throne 'cause that's where the boss man sits. Gross. That chair smells like Frank's butt. It's not actually Frank's butt. I think it's a combination of all of our butt smells.
 That's worse.
 Yeah. Why would anybody want that chair? No, no, it's not about the chair itself.
 It's what the chair represents. The chair represents power.
 Mmm. Okay, well, all right. How do we divvy up Frank's shares then? Uh Okay, well, um I'll-I'll take 'em. You? You? You think we're gonna give the shares to the man who wants to pull a mutant from a mystery hole in the bar and live with him? Look, I'm just trying to come up with a system.
 We got to have a system here
 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! We do have a system for this. Paddy's succession plan, remember? Oh, shit! Right. Yes, right! Paddy's succession plan. It was like a will that we drew up to help us determine who would get each one of our shares
 in the very likely event of our untimely deaths.
 That's right. We drank, like, three bottles of tequila and then we started talking about our legacy and how important that was to us. Oh! Got to have a legacy.
 Oh, here we go.
 Oh, oh! Yeah, okay.
 On a paper plate, huh?
 Read it! Read it! "Paddy's succession plan. Paddy's Pub shall secure our legacy here henceforth and forevermore, throughout the birthright of our firstborn kin."
 Who had the pen here?
 It makes sense. Don't be a bitch. What it means is every one of our shares gets passed down to our firstborn. Right, right! Our firstborn!
 The shares get passed down to the firstborn kin?
 Yeah. We are the firstborn kin of Frank. Well, now, hang on. That's not, like, an official document. Uh, well, you signed it in your blood. Oh, that Yeah, there it is "Trundle," written in blood. Oh, yeah, I was going by Trundle at the time, wasn't I? No, no, no. You were trying to write "Charlie" and you wrote "Trundle." No, I was going by Trundle the Great. You came up with that after you miswrote it. Look, the point is you can't just take the bar based on a paper plate. Sorry, Charlie. I'm siding with Dennis and Dee. I'm your humble servant. You're just gonna give it to them? That's a binding contract, okay? You wrote it in blood. That's gonna hold up in a court of law and I know when to pick a side.
 I'm siding with Dennis and Dee.
 Wait, hold on a second. You guys aren't even actually Frank's kid. You're Bruce Mathis's kid, all right? And I technically might be Frank's kid. Charlie, I pledge my allegiance to you. No, no, no, no. Wait a second, no.
 But Frank is a Reynolds, and we are Reynolds.
 Yep, we're Reynolds. Yeah, and it's the name that carries on the line, not maybe being someone's bastard kid. It was always you guys. I tricked him. It was always you. It is the blood that binds. And his blood is pumping through my veins. And I shall prove it. This is a little bit harder because he might win 'cause he had some good points, but you guys might win
 We don't give a shit about what you're talking about!
 It doesn't matter. Hey-o! There's my guy! Hey, I got a piping hot grilled Frank for you, okay? I got the sausage, the Spam, the bacon. I got it wrapped in a jelly pancake and cooked with a stick of butter. I don't want that, Charlie. I'm trying to get in shape. I read all about this phenomenon that guys' bodies immediately turn to shit the second they retire.
 Oh, yeah?
 I got to work on it. All right, well, you know, just-just take a peek, see if you like it.
 Uh, hey, listen, man, can I ask you something?
 What? Are you, like, um my dad? What? Are, like Are you the father of me and shit?
 We've been over this.
 Yeah.
 Your mother's a giant whore.
 Right. I don't want to stress about this, Charlie. I'm retired. Leave me alone. I want to watch a little TV.
 Yeah. All right.
 Charlie, hey Oh. Hey, can I talk to you for a sec? Uh, yeah. Hey.
 Hey, um, I came up with a really great idea, dude.
 Yeah? I'm gonna play both sides.
 Why would you tell me that?
 Should I not have? Probably shouldn't 'cause if you're trying to keep a secret from me, now I know. I should've Should I tell them? No, I don't think you should tell either side 'cause if you're trying to play both sides and they both know, you're not playing anybody.
 What should I do now?
 I don't give a shit. Why are you here? I'm here to prove my allegiance to you because I believe that you're the rightful heir.
 Okay, whatever.
 All right, well, I see that you don't believe me.
 Why would I?
 So I am prepared to take a blood oath with you. Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
 Oh, my God, dude!
 Oh, God.
 Oh, that was Frank's toe knife!
 Oh, it hurts so much.
 Quick, shake on it.
 No, I'm not gonna touch your blood. Do you have something I could I gotta close this wound.
 Plug it up.
 That was not as cool as I thought it was gonna be. That sock's probably gonna get it more infected though. All right, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, dude.
 We gotta prove that Frank is your dad.
 I know.
 That makes you the rightful
 He doesn't want to have that conversation with me. He's certainly not gonna get tested, you know? He's really resistant to the whole thing. All right, then we're gonna have to do some testing of our own.
 Yeah?
 I can choke a man out in four seconds flat. Oh, yeah? Yeah, I guess we could try that or, uh Yeah. All right. You know, we could probably take his blood right now. He's out. He's staring right at us. Yeah, he's been falling asleep with his eyes open like that. But he's way out. I mean, we could prick him. He won't feel a thing. Frank!
 Anything?
 Nothing! Not a single butt smell to that. How is that possible? I don't know. It's either this guy's butt or this brand of chair.
 It's got to be the brand, right?
 We got to get one of these for our throne.
 Yeah. Yeah. Hey!
 Hey! Hey, what do you say, Doc? So, what is the verdict? Is Frank Charlie's dad or not? I don't know. I don't know who that is. What I do know is I came to work this morning to find a very large bucket of blood in my lab. Yeah, well, that's the sample, obviously, and, uh, you know if it's too big, it's 'cause Frank sprung a little bit of a leak there.
 Yeah, it was a mess, huh?
 He was bleeding like crazy. There was blood everywhere. But we caught enough of it.
 Yeah, we must have caught a deep vein or something.
 I think. Wait a second. Most of this came from one man?
 Did we take too much? I didn't think we took too much.
 Nah. Yes. You took too much. Also, there's traces of more than four individuals in here, and at least one animal. Ah, shit. Was there blood in the bucket before? It is a blood bucket, so, yeah, there was old blood. I didn't come here to get sassed, okay? I came here to get an answer to my question. So is Frank Charlie's dad or not? The only thing that I can tell you is that based off of how much blood is in this bucket your friend is in desperate need of blood. All right, Dee, the bar is finally ours. Let's talk redecoration.
 Well, I'm thinking chrome, and I'm thinking chrome everywhere.
 Hmm. The other thing that's important to me is a proper dance floor. That way, any time I want to just pop a boogie, I can do it wherever I am and it won't be weird, you know what I mean?
 Okay.
 Oh, think of it, brother. With them out of the way, we can do as we please. Two butts, one throne. You know what, you've been doing this all day. Why are you talking like that?
 I'm just being I'm being arch.
 Why? Well, because we're being devious and we're plotting and I just wanted to make sure that it was clear that we were devious and plotting. You don't need to indicate to me that you're being devious when you're actually being devious. I guess I had some concerns that you wouldn't pick up on it if I didn't make it super clear. But if you start doing that, everybody's gonna pick up on it.
 And that defeats the purpose.
 Yeah, got it. Dennis, Dee, quickly. We don't have much time. Charlie and I doctored a paternity test to make it look like Frank is Charlie's dad. But the tests were actually inconclusive. There was too much blood in the bucket to tell. The reason I'm telling you all this is because I'm playing both sides so that I always come out on top. So, with this information, I'm gonna leverage you guys into making me the head of security at the new Paddy's Pub. Okay, okay, couple things right off the bat there, pal. Number one, um
 never tell one side that you're playing both sides.
 Yeah. And number two, if you are gonna play both sides don't give away the information before you get what you want. Oh, shit.
 Right. Don't give away the information.
 Yeah. All right. If I am gonna play both sides, what should I do? You're still telling us that you're playing both sides, so why would we help you? Uh Okay, well, what if I make a blood allegiance to you guys?
 Oh! Gross.
 Ooh. Yeah, I, uh I sliced it with Frank's toe knife and, uh It's not bleeding anymore, but maybe I could
 Oh, yeah, here. I'll just get it again.
 Oh. Oh, shit!
 Oh, God!
 Jesus, dude, that was the lime knife.
 Oh, I feel that It stings. Oh, Dee, here, shake my
 No, get away from me. Gross.
 Ah, Dennis?
 No, your blood is disgusting.
 What should I do?
 Go to the doctor.
 Mac, why the hell did you sprint ahead of me, man?
 'Cause I'm playing both sides.
 Jesus Christ.
 Wow. Well, it doesn't matter. Okay, guys, I got some documentation here proving that I am the rightful heir to Frank's butt chair.
 Yeah.
 All right, Charlie, save it. Save it. Mac already told us that that's not a real paternity test. What the hell, dude? You swore a blood oath to me. Dude, you never touched my blood, okay? All right, you know what, if you really want to work here
 kick Charlie out of here.
 Hmm.
 Really?
 Mm-hmm. No problem, dude. Charlie, let's go, bud. Get All right, dude, I'm gonna carry you out. Oh, shit. Oh, my God, he is so heavy. He's, like, grounding himself with something. Oh, now he's going limp. No, come on, dude. That's not fair. Help me out here, Charlie. Help me out. That's it, dude. That's it. I'm choking you out.
 Okay.
 You're going out, dude. You're going to sleep. Good night, dude. Good night, bitch. Your head of security just choked himself out. Hey, Frank, I know you're trying to be healthy so I got you a hoagie with extra pickles in it. I figured you could use the veggies and stuff
 Oh, shit!
 Hi, Charlie. What's going on with you, man? I forgot to dye my hair this morning. What's up with your teeth? I was eating some of Deandra's pyramid scheme berries to try to get healthy.
 Right.
 I feel a little light-headed. All right, well, I'm sure it's nothing, you know. Probably just, like, tired from working hard and then You know, the body crashes when 0h, shit, did you fall asleep again? Frank?
 Is he dead?
 Oh, shit.
 He looks bad.
 What are you sneaking up on me for? Listen. Dennis is acting weird and I don't like it. Now I know he's got something planned, but he's not indicating so I don't know what it is. Right. No, I get that, I guess, so Yes, yes, exactly, Charlie. So here's the plan
 We need to outsmart him before he can have us murdered
 Are you okay? And throw us in Hmm? Do you need a glass of water or something?
 No, I'm good.
 What's happening?
 I'm I'm being arch.
 Oh. We're doing a thing together, so you know Yeah, no, I know, just 'cause you're telling me what's up. Okay, okay, fine. The point is we gotta prove that you're the rightful heir to the throne. Of course. That's why I got this plastic bag 'cause my blood bucket was inconclusive.
 You just need a couple drops.
 Right, yeah.
 So let's open him up.
 Yeah, all right. But, you know we gotta be careful 'cause I think I took too much blood last time.
 Is that what's going on?
 Yeah. Okay, you just need a couple drops.
 All right, just a prick. Just a little prick.
 Just a prick.
 Oh! It's a tremendous amount of blood.
 Dear God, so much blood! So much blood! I think we hit an artery. Look at this.
 Yeah.
 Oh, shit.
 Is he okay?
 No, he's okay. The duct tape'll stop it. Okay, let's just get Wait. Oh, shit, this is leaking. Oh, no. Oh, shit, here
 Stop, stop!
 Aaah!
 Oh, damn it.
 Shoot, Charlie, I'm sorry. I was trying to help. Can't imagine it was gonna be a very good sample anyway. There are quite a few pickles floating around in that bag.
 Yeah, let's think.
 Shit. Wait a second Which one of you and Dennis was firstborn?
 We're twins.
 No, I know, I know, but, like who did Barbara actually, like, pop out first? Oh, shit. Oh, Charlie.
 "Worst is first!"
 What is that? "Worst is first." My mom used to say that to me all the time because I was first and she thought I was the worst.
 Holy shit, that's terrible, but that's good for us.
 Yeah!
 Yeah!
 So that means you're the rightful heir to the butt chair. So, all right, we can work with that. Let's get out of here. Come on.
 We can't tell anybody about this, all right?
 Okay.
 All right, let's just go.
 Let's just leave it. I've always hated these. So that's gonna change. Worst is first, dude. Worst is first. What are you talking about, man? Dee is conspiring against you. Charlie figured it out. Worst is first. Charlie and Dee were getting blood from Frank when Charlie realized Dee was born first. Therefore, she's the rightful heir. Then I got a little bit more blood from Frank, 'cause I feel like we're probably gonna use it in the future and he was already opened up, so who gives a shit? Okay, all right. How'd you get all this information? I was hiding in Frank's apartment and then they went out into the hallway and I heard them through the door. Dude, the best part is I'm gonna use this information to leverage you into giving me a better position under your reign. You just told me the inform You know what? Forget it. Good job. Um, how about the position of my pawn? How's that sound? Pawn. Pawns are cool. There's a lot of them, you know. They move diagonally. I've always thought that I move a little bit too much forward and back and I should be more like like 'Cause then you can't see me if I'm coming at you like this. Like, sideways. Well, watch. Well, don't move your head, dude. What if you keep your head there but close your eyes You know what, it doesn't matter. I need you to do something for me. Oh. Oh, my God. That is crazy. It's the smell of a thousand butts. Hey! Dennis! Dennis, I did your bidding.
 Good.
 Yeah. Frank is on his way. But, dude, whatever it is you got planned, you better do it fast because if Dee and Charlie get that birth certificate, you're screwed. Look, Mac, I told you, I've got it under control.
 Everything is going according to my plan.
 Right. Worst is first! Worst is first!

  Oh, Brother, looks as though you've underes
 Stop doing that. It doesn't work.
 No? Look, we found the birth certificate proving Dee was born first.
 Worst is first.
 Worst is first. Yeah, and then Charlie and I, we made a blood oath, so now we're in cahoots.
 Yeah!
 Trundle, can I get in on that?
 I'm on their side.
 Nasty. You idiots. Did you not think that I had anticipated this? While you were running around town like lunatics, chopping your hands to bits I did a little bit of research. Turns out Franquito isn't a shell corporation after all. He's a person. Dee, you remember Josefina, our maid from the early '80s? Yeah. Well, turns out Frank had been banging her for years and just before we were born, he was. Franquito! ¡Ven acàl Holy shit!
 Whoa!
 What? Yeah, look upon him. Yeah, he doesn't speak any English, by the way, so don't try talking to him. But we worked something out. Yeah, Frank's shares go to him, 'cause he's the firstborn and then Franquito signs to me. It's game, set and match. Holy shit. What is happening right now? I'm not I'm not feeling so well. Retirement is difficult. Anyway Hey, Frank! Guess who this is. Haven't seen him in a while, have you? Come closer. It's your son. Franquito. Yes. Of course it is. Look how beautiful he is. Oh! My one true child. Come closer. Oh! You give me so much joy right now. And, so, Frank, the bar shall go to him.
 Oh!
 Just need you to sign here and here. When a man is no longer needed in the tribe his body betrays him. Yeah. When he has no purpose the blood seems to drain from his body leaving him a shell of the man he once was. All right, I don't know where you're going with this, but can you just sign?
 I'm unretiring.
 Wh-What? I have a plan. I will retain all and Franquito will help me run the bar as my number two. Speaking of number two Dude. Goddamn it! Come on. I just cleaned that. That's Frank's butt smell. That is it. I told you.
 Oh, no!
 That is the exact smell of the chair. Everything is better than it was before.
 No, it isn't.
 No.
 It's so much worse.
 I have my son to rule with me.
 No, you don't.
 What do you mean? Because Franquito's not your son. I made it all up. What? How? All right, look, guys, it's very simple. Seven years ago, I walked into a Wawa, and I saw this guy and I thought, "Holy shit! That guy looks just like Frank, but, you know, Mexican." And then I came up with a plan where I could make Frank believe that he had a son with our maid Josefina all those years ago and I could bilk him out of a shitload of money under the guise that the money was all going to his firstborn son, Franquito when, in fact, the money was going to me. And it worked too. It was a good plan. Yeah, but that's, like, incredibly devious, dude. I mean, you've been screwing Frank for years? You would have done that too, right, if you'd thought of it?
 Uh, I don't know.
 I don't know, man. I mean Yeah, I think you guys would have, but either way, it doesn't matter, you know 'cause everything is, uh, as it should be, so let's grab some drinks.
 No, everything is not as it should be.
 Wait, wait. You tried to screw us out of the bar.
 Yeah, you tried to steal the bar.
 No, no, no. I was trying to get things back to the way they were Get him back on the throne so we could get back to doing the things we love to do at Paddy's, you know, like, um, finding out what's at the bottom of a hole.
 Shit.
 Right? Did we ever Did you ever find out what was at the bottom of that?
 No, we dropped it completely.
 Oh, shit, dude. There could be a Goonies situation down there, right?
 That's what I was thinking.
 We were discussing that.
 You know, the hole in the bathroom?
 You feeling better?
 I feel pretty good about this.
 Let's go check it out.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 Let's It's in the bathroom.
 You want to try to flush that thing one more time?
 Ah, the hole. Oh, I'm so excited things are back to the way they were. Yes. Go play in your little hole, you fools. You still need me to stick around, or can I No, Franquito. We're done here. Can I get my five bucks? Yes, you can get your five bucks. Goddamn, you're a greedy bastard. Happy New Year 2016
 New Year, New Color ;-)                       DENNIS: Uh I feel like you guys should have, like, dressed up a little bit for this. CHARLIE: No, no, it sends the wrong image, you know? Uh, we're not selling a game for squares, we're selling a game for, like, everyday people like us, man. DENNIS: Yeah, that's a good point. MAC: Oh, Frank, Frank, Frank. You will never guess what happened. Okay. So this guy comes in, right? We think he's just a regular customer. We start chatting him up. Turns out, he's an executive at Mattel. DEE: Yeah, so of course we start talking to him about Chardee MacDennis, and he seemed totally into it. Yeah, he's coming by today, man. We're gonna pitch it to him. Maybe we could, uh, work in some of the ideas I've been suggesting. Those aren't "ideas" as much as they are random acts of violence. Well, you see, when I was a kid, games were much more violent. I mean, we used to play "Purple Nurple," "Sock Full of Quarters," "Kick the Jew" DEE: No, why don't you try winning one time? And then you can start throwing in new rules. How about we just change the name of the game then? "Franken MacChardeeden." MAC: What? That's terrible. First of all, your name isn't "Franken." Secondly, Chardee MacDennis is just a working title. Technically, we're still in arbitration. Last we left it, Dee had filibustered, and Charlie had a motion pending. And I will not yield to the gentleman. 'Cause you have no honor, you goddamn bitch. You have no honor! You see what I'm talking about-- it's a whole thing, Frank. Then let's call it "Chardee MacDennis 2: Electric Boogaloo." What? What are you talking about? What does that have to do with anything? What made you just think of that? It's not a break-dancing competition. There's no electricity involved. (door opens) Uh-uh-uh-uh. Hey, there, how's it going, uh Andy was it? Yes, exactly. Ah, Andy, I want you to meet Frank. Frank, uh, meet Andy from Mattel. Hello, hello. I got to tell ya-- I'm pretty excited. Adult game play is a fast-rising market, and we are always on the lookout for something a little out of the box. Oh, we-we can help you there, bud. That's great. Now, what was the name of the game again? Chardee MacDennis 2: Electric Boogaloo. Okay, Andy, you're gonna like this video we made for you. (screaming) (Charlie shouts indistinctly) (echoing): Chardee MacDennis. Chardee MacDennis is all your favorite games rolled into one: Mouse Trap, Chutes and Ladders, Sorry But it's not exactly like those things. It's also like Boggle, Wheel of Fortune, Risk. MAN: Chardee MacDennis! What other games do you like? It's like those other games too! But more better. And different enough legally. I'm a lawyer. Shh! I'm a lawyer in this part. We're like Moby remix! (air horn blares) MAN: Ch-Ch-Chardee MacDennis! Regular board games should be called "I'm bored games" I don't get that one. I No, I told you not to Stay out of my peripheral Do you want a game that lulls you into a sense of security, but surprises you with constant rule changes? Then you want the game of games Back back up. Sorry. MAN (thundering): Chardee MacDennis! We always win. And they always lose. CHARLIE: What are you guys doing over there? Oh, shit. (static hissing) W-Why'd you put that in? Yeah, what was that? Factually accurate. So, Andy, what did you think? I got to say, it's a little confusing. Uh, can't we just play the game? Ooh. Ooh, ooh, ooh. Yeah. That wouldn't be good. Yeah, see, we tend to get a little competitive when we play. You know, we're not exactly a mellow bunch. Right. That'll be fun. Plus, that's the best way for me to understand the game. But that's whatwhy you would understand Yeah, that's why we did that. Okay, let me confer with my associates for a minute. Why don't you grab a drink? It's o-on the house, of course. Um, guys, can we talk? Uh, cool, man. I think we can probably, um We can't No, no, no no, no, I-I think we can. Uh, we can do this, guys. We just got to be just got to make it fun. You know what we have to do? Is we have to not care about who wins. Just for this time. Yes. That'll help. That will help. We just have to sell the game. Just sell it. Okay. We can do it. All right, so, Frank, you'll be on Andy's team. Wait, don't stick me with him. He-he doesn't know the goddamn rules. I'm gonna get crushed again. Shut up, Frank, just Shut up. Shut up. It's not about winning or losing. Exactly. It doesn't matter. It's fun. We're not gonna care It's fun. So we'll just we'll keep our emotions in check. Yeah. Sure. Just be like: (exhales) (all exhaling) Exactly. (exhaling continues) Gentlemen, good luck to you. And to yous. And to yous all. This is nice-- a little role playing. Very big in gaming right now. This also celebrates sportsmanship. Yes, indeed. Yeah, well, you're totally getting it. You're catching on. Oh, by the way, there used to be a couple rules about not cursing and not asking questions in certain rounds, but I think we should do away with that, for now, because it's your first time playing and, guys, we don't want anybody blacking out. Yeah, no problem. Right, that's fine. I think that'll be fine. We're flexible. It's a good idea. Okay, are we ready? Three, two, one. Gentlemen suck my dick. (shouting gibberish) Hut, hut, hut. (playing bugle) What the hell's going on? Oh, uh, this is our flag-raising ceremony. Yeah, we used to do the Maori war dance, but that-that got us a little too riled up. Either way, this is all about intimidation and showing off your prowess. Uh, think of it like the Indian-Pakistani border ceremony that they do over there. Now, this is Mac and Charlie's flag, which, as you can see, is fairly badly burned. Not only does the winner get to stomp the loser's game pieces, but they also get to burn their flag up. Now, you'll notice that the Golden Geese flag is unsullied. You'll also notice that Mac and Charlie's flag is just a little weird, and that's because their original name was the Thundercats, uh but they were confused by that. Well, 'cause we're not cats. Yeah. We're not cats. So, then, how could we Mm-hmm. Even though it's the name they chose. So they went with the Thundermen. (playing quavering note) This brings us to Frank's flag, which is, uh yeah, it's just unfortunate. FRANK: It's four Fs. I didn't know it was gonna come off like that. Pretty sure you did. (playing rousing tune) Okay, Andy, Level 1 is Trivia, Puzzles and Artistry. The first team to get three points moves their game piece to the next level. All right. Here we go. All right. What Philly celebrity would you most want to have a drink with? Oh, shit, okay, yeah, you know what-- a lot of the questions are opinion-based. Heads up. Ah. Okay I-I see. Uh, all right, this is, uh, let me guess. Um Oh: Dr. J. That's not it! All right, all right. Play it cool, play it cool. Okay, okay, sorry. Yeah, all right. That is wrong, though. You wouldn't want to have a drink with him. Dee, chance to steal. Bill Cosby. Yes! All right. Point for us. Shit. A lot of the questions are outdated. Yeah, yeah, they are a little outdated. Okay, our turn, our turn. Um, artistry. And it's an all-play, guys. Oh! Oh! All right, now, a member of each team must make this clue out of clay while the other member tries to guess what it is. Okay, uh, penis. What? Uh, lip-penis. What? No, look, look. Oh, hard penis. A hard clay penis. Oh Gargoyle inside. No? It's a-a, okay, a chopped-off head, a decapitat uh, head in a box! Dee, I'm gonna put your head in a box if you don't start getting the answer right. Goddamn it! A heart, it's a heart! Uh, it's, uh it's, uh, love! Love! Oh! He got it! Was that it? (whoops) Get another card. How do you make a heart? If the Love? Yeah, because I was making, uh, Cupid's arrow, dude. Well, why does it have a big vein running through it? Because that's the streak as it flies through the air. Come At least I didn't put a woman's head in a box. This is not a woman's head in a box, you sick freak. This is a woman's head in a freezer. And it's supposed to represent the preservation of love forever and ever. Whatever, dude. It's our turn, it's our turn. We go. BOTH: No puzzles, no puzzles, no puzzles, no puzzles no puzzles, no puzzles Puzzles. Oh! Put this bottle back together. Oh, shit. Oh. Yeah. Oh, that's interesting. What bottle? This one. Now just be very, very careful. Okay. Final touches, final touches. Watch that blue string-- don't pull it apart. Okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay. All right. Ready, ready? Okay, okay, okay okay. Okay, very Very careful. Very, very careful. It held. It held! It held! Just swallowed a little glass, but it held, man! You see, that's what I'm talking about-- you sacrifice, you put the work in That's right! you earn that card. We're catching up to 'em. Hey Okay, it's our turn, then. Dennis and Dee skip right to Level 2. Yes, yes! Aw Aw Face, face! (squawks) Due to some alcohol-related cheating, we decided to incorporate I.V.'s to keep everything on the up-and-up. You guys were the ones that were cheating. Yeah, yeah. Now, I feel like Andy has to have one of these. Well, Andy's our guest. We don't want to be poking him with needles. Unfair, unfair! Yeah, unfair, unfair, unfair. Hey, hey, as you can see, Mac and Charlie are a little worked up about never having won the game. Ever. I'm a little concerned about the safety of this. The Why Oh, oh, If it were beer? No, no, no, no-- we're mainlining wine. It's not beer. We switched Level 2 to wine because you can't mainline beer because it's got bubbles in it and shit. We tried-- it was bad. I'm not sure it's safe for people to put those beverages directly in Time! (blasting note) (gasps) Oh! (grunts) Okay, Andy, welcome to Round 2 (Body): Physical Challenge, Pain and Endurance. Okay, now, we've added a new challenge to Level 2-- this is, this is really exciting. So what you do-- you spin the globe, you point your finger. Wherever your finger lands, you have to speak in the accent of that region for the rest of the round, otherwise, you gotta drink. That sounds fun. That's a great idea. Isn't that good? Isn't that good? Let's go. Uh ha! Russia! Oh, okay, so I got it. I guess I (Russian accent): I guess I got to do that? Huh? (Russian accent): You do Russia. Hey, look at Andy, look at Andy. Okay, let's see DENNIS: What do you got? "Brasial." No, Brazil. Mm-hmm. Wh-What's the accent of Brazil? It's a-it's a country in South America-- why don't we say any Latin American accent'll do? Any Latin American? Okay. (bad Mexican accent): Okay, homie. Uh Hola, le homes. Yeah, I can do that. Yeah. Okay, man. Nachos. Oh, real racist with it, huh? Yeah, that is extremely racist-- and by the way, that's more of a Los Angeles sort of Mexican cholo vibe. Let's go let's go see the Dodgers play the Lakers. Low rider. Okay. Uh, Dee, you want to spin for us? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Jesus Christ. Oh! Ah, would you look at that-- Philadelphia. FRANK: That shouldn't be on there. You barely spinned it, homes. That's bullshit, man. (Philadelphia accent): Hallelujah. Looks like the tide's turned. Yeah, looks like we got an advantage over yous guys, huh, Den? (with accent): What is going on? What the hell is that? My Philly accent. Wow, that's not even close. Drink, homes. Ow! Okay, slower. All right. Physical challenge. And this one's an all-play. Oh! Hey! Okay, everybody. This is good. We like Hands on a bird body! (groans) A member from each team must try and keep their hand on Dee's bony body for as long as they can. (groans) Dis is shit. Dis is not good. I don't understand. (exhales through teeth) Hang in there, homes. I can't do it, "mang." I can't do it. You barely even put your hand on there already. Hang in there, man. I know, but Ah! I can't do it, I can't do it! Oh! Ha! Mac, that's crazy! Ay, ay, ay! Mac and Charlie are out! Hey, why'd you do that? I couldn't do it! Ay, ay, ay! Oh, violation! That's not L.A. Mexican. That's, like, Cartoon Mexican. We barely even switched it, homie. No, I don't know. I'll have a drink, all right? You got to drink, too. Oh (Middle Eastern accent): What is so hard about keeping one hand on this woman? She's a very pleasant woman. She's a very, very pretty woman. Ugh. Don't sexualize her, dude. This is bad enough as it is. (Germanic accent): Vhat is the matter, Dennis? Vhy are you zo uncomfortable? Because the closeness of your hand to her breast Stop. Yeah, stop. which is making you want to have sex with her? Don't, don't oh, goddamn it! Ugh! Oh Oh! (gasps) Wait, what's what's going on? You stupid idiot. Oh, my God, you glued your hand to her! Cheater! Cheater! Cheater! Oh, is that the accent drop? Yeah, yeah, all accents are dropped the minute someone gets caught cheating. Yeah, yeah, we have to be able to break them in our native tongue to allow for maximum shame. Shame, shame, shame Shame, shame (all shouting "Shame!") So so no more I.V.'s? No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. That's a Level 2 game. You don't want to mainline liquor, buddy. You don't want to do it. Still a pretty stiff drink. Oh, yeah. Things get ratcheted up in Level 3. Then even get worse in Level 4. There is no Level 4. Yes, there is: Mind, body, spirit, horror. Stop, Frank. Come on. There's no horror level. Look, Andy, his ideas don't represent the game. They don't represent us. Okay, pick a card now Whoa! Shits and Ladders. Oh! (chuckles) Sort of a play on Chutes and Ladders. Oh, yeah. Each member must take a laxative and get on a ladder. The one who can hold it in the longest wins. FRANK: Love this one. Also known as Shoots and Splatters. Poops and Bladders! (laughter) Andy! I'll go get the laxatives. All right, All right. FRANK: Here you go. Strongest stuff on the market. All right. All right. (grunts) Mm. Oh, that's strong. Ugh! I don't like it. Okay, to the ladders! (groans) I'm already feeling a twinge. (yawns) Yeah, I-I feel something. I don't feel like I have to poop, though. I feel weird. I kind of feel crazy. Like, what is that? That isn't a laxative, is it, Frank? Nope. Welcome to Level 4, (echoing): horror. (distorted laughter) Oh. What is this? Wake up, guys. Wake up. What's going on? (grunting) (groaning) FRANK: Hello, gang. The keys to your cuffs have been sewn into your forearm. Beside you are some tweezers attached to a car battery. Last team out of the room loses. Frank, this is insane. Let us out of here! What are you doing? Everything has to be based on an existing board game! That's the whole thing! Oh, but it is, Dennis. Ever hear of a game called Operation? (cackles) Oh, shit. He's got a point. Damn it. Let's go. (grunting) (zapping) (shouting) (zapping continues) This game is totally insane! DENNIS: Don't give up on the game! The game is fine! (groans) No, no, no, no. No, this isn't representative of us Oh, God! Oh! Oh, I'm gonna stop! I'm gonna stop! No, I quit, too. I quit. I can't do it. I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it! DENNIS: Oh, God! It's just the bone. DEE: Charlie! Oh, Jesus Christ, dude! Oh! Oh! I think you shit your pants, too. Well, it was probably just the laxative kicking in. It wasn't a goddamn laxative, Charlie! You just pooped your pants! You guys quit! You quit and we won the game! (grunts) Finally. Finally, I won the game. This is not what I signed up for, you donkey-brained maniac! Uncuff me! Cool it, cool it. Take it easy. I mean, it's just a it's just a simple mind game. No one had a key on 'em. You know, I knew they'd cave like bitches. DENNIS: Hold on a second. Wait a second. Andy, did you just call him "donkey-brained"? Yeah. What? It's an expression. What did you mean by "not what I signed up for"? Do you two know each other? No! No No. No. No. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait-- look at this, guys. "Mattel" is spelled wrong on his business card. That says "Matel." I'm calling this number. (phone ringing) FRANK (recorded): Welcome to the home of Wolf Cola (gasps) (shouting "Cheaters!") Oh, okay, Frank, so you clearly just hired this guy so that you could win and put your stamp on the game! No, there's no truth in that at all. No. Tell 'em, Andy. (door slams) MAC: What?! It was all bullshit? It was just a hoax? Yeah. DENNIS: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait Unreal. So, then, if this isn't about selling the game anymore Well, then it's about winning. DENNIS: Okay, here we go. Public humiliation. Are you ready, Charles? (slurring): Yes Okay, I'm-I'm in a sort of Dude, are you-you sure you're okay? You might've lost a lot of blood from digging around in there with the tweezers. You know. He's around it. Yep. Here we go. Okay, then here we go. You have to withstand one full minute of intense berating. Okay, that's, uh, lights on. He's ready. "Lights on," he said. "Lights on." Okay. But it's not gonna be from us. Nope. Not from us. It's from her! Ow! Ow! You're holding my hair! Okay, hold on a second. Ow, let go! Oh, my God, that hurt so much! Goddamn it. Okay, well, you know what, it was supposed to be a big reveal. I had a whole thing planned. What's wrong with you? You know what, of course you ruined it-- you are the worst. THE WAITRESS: Oh, my God, what is that smell? Is that poop? Did you poop in your pants, Charlie? Yeah. Oh, gross. That's so disgusting. This is gonna be so easy. No, dude, don't listen to them, okay? (sniffles) You can do this, Charlie. If you can not cry for just one minute, just one minute, we win the goddamn game. Yeah, man. You can do this. Are you ready? Yeah. (grunts) Okay, yeah. All right. Okay. Okay. Here we go. I can do DENNIS: Ready, get set, go. Charlie Kelly, I have been waiting for this for a long time, you poop-smelling (distorted): trash person. Your face, it looks like a troll! You look like you have troll features! You stalked me! There's something wrong with you! Your brain is broken! I hate you! I hope you die! And I hope you go to hell! Three! Two! And I hope it burns! One! (distorted shouting) You did it! You did it! Holy shit! MAC: We won! (shouts happily) DENNIS: Charlie? DEE: Come on, buddy, you can do it. Come on, wake up, Charlie, wake up. I don't know if he's gonna wake up. I don't either. Charlie, come on, buddy. Charlie, are you okay? Charlie Charlie, open your eyes. DENNIS: Charlie? Oh. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. There he is. Oh, thank God. Oh, thank God. We thought we lost you, buddy. We thought we lost you. Hey. Oh, my God. Oh, man. What happened? God like, all I remember is, like, winning the game and then passing out. Is that how you remember it? Yeah. Yeah. No. No, no, you cried like a baby. Yeah, pretty much right when the waitress started talking, you cried like a little bitch. Quite a bit. Yeah. Yeah. You-you must have been hallucinating from all the blood poisoning. So did you guys win? Yeah. Big-time. We always do. So did you crush our game pieces? No. Oh, my God, Charlie, no. Charlie, we weren't even thinking about the game anymore. No one was. We were terrified for you. With you in that condition? Really? Oh, thank you. Oh, thank you so much, guys. Oh, God. Are you kidding me? That's, like, really, the nicest thing you've ever done. Uh, Dee, can you Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. (sighs) Charlie, no, we wouldn't have done that with you with you in that condition. Yeah. It-it No. But now that you're conscious, you know Dee, are you, uh, all set back there? Yep. Okay. Loser. Yeah! (both taunting, screeching) DEE: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! (both honking) Yeah! Yeah!                        FRANK: Charlie, can I come in already? CHARLIE: Well, that depends, Frank. Are you done farting? FRANK: No. Well, then you're gonna keep hanging your ass out the window till you're done, all right? Look, I-I warned you. You want to put slices of rum ham on a Grilled Charlie? That's a stomach "bomba." It's too much for your system. Then make me another one. If I'm gonna stick my ass out the window, I'm gonna eat. Unbelievable. Alright, here we go. I feel like it's gonna be a week before your system gets back to normal. Y-You can't just eat whatever you Charlie (crashing, shattering) Holy shit! Are you okay?! Frank?! Hey, are you all right? (groans) (echoing): Hey! Are you okay? (groans) (echoing): Are you all right, man? Frank! Where are you going?! MAC: I'm the one that came up with the chickens to contaminate the steaks. I was the first one to say that, right? I-I don't think so, no. I don't think so. You t Are you serious? No, I remember being on the phone and Yeah, being totally serious. Dennis, Deandra! Yeah. What? No, I-I I-I feel like I came up with it. It's me! What, do you want a goddamn medal? Yeah, get out of here, Frank. We're right in the middle of something very important. I was on the phone; I came up with it. What are you talking about? That never happened Your mother's dead. I thought I was the one that Yeah, we know she's dead. I think I was the one that told you to make that call. I-I was just kidding. Uh, your mother's not really dead. Uh, I dropped that bomb to soften the blow. We're getting divorced. Wh-What's happening? Are you doing a bit, Frank? It's not funny. (overlapping chatter) Hey! Hey! Oh, shit, man, are you okay? And who might you be? Wh-What?! Uh-oh, he's finally lost it. Should we toss him in a home? Yep. I-I'll get the car. N-N-No, guys, guys. Frank fell out my window. We had our, like, fire escape taken off, and, dude, you, like, must have hit your head real hard. (scoffs) Look, you seem like a really nice kid. But my head is fine. Oh, my God. (gasps) Oh, shit. MAC: Oh, my God. Oh, it's his skull! CHARLIE: Uh, okay, Frank. Um, what day is it? Wednesday. Yes. Wrong, it's Tuesday. Is it? Actually, no, it's-it's Wednesday. He's right. I Did I lose a day? Yeah. Okay, you know what? I got one. Um, what is the capital of Pennsylvania? Philadelphia. Yes. No. I don't think that's right. Uh, is it Pittsburgh? Uh, at one point, it was Philly. I'm pretty sure. I don't think they change it. MAC: All right, let's just, let's ask something easier. Who's the president of the United States? George Bush. Nah, I was just kidding. The real president of the United States is Dick Cheney. He's pulling all the strings. Ah, shit, Frank, what year do you think it is? Oh, man. Whoa. Well, okay, so something clearly happened to Frank when he fell out of that window. I think what happened is he went through the window, and the window seemed to be some sort of portal to the year 2006. He has a concussion. It's not 2006. It's crazy, but stranger things have happened. No, they haven't. No, they haven't. DENNIS: A-A-All right. Guys, guys, guys. You remember ten years ago when Frank first came back, and he wanted to, like, give all his money away to charity and reconnect with his kids and shit? Right, then he started hanging out with Mac and Charlie, got a taste of the bar lifestyle and decided he'd rather live in squalor. Guys, we have an opportunity to change history. Are you talking about taking all his money and kicking him out? Of course that's what I'm talking about. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I want to do that. I-I want to do that. I'm in. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We got to come up with a plan here. What if Charlie and I take Frank to the strip club like before, so he keeps thinking it's 2006? We can't repeat the same mistakes of the past. 'Cause that might trigger his memories. In fact, keep Charlie away from Frank. I mean, he's drawn to him for some inexplicable reason. Dee, here's what we'll do. You and I will actually reconnect with Frank this time instead of rejecting him. Okay, we just got to figure out a way to get him to write us a check for that money. You know what we could do is we could do like a Wyclef Jean thing and create a charity for Haiti and then allegedly keep all the money for ourselves. By the time he figures out what the hell's going on  We'll be gone till November, we'll be gone till November  DEE AND DENNIS:  And tell my baby I'll be gone till November  (mumbling lyrics) DEE, DENNIS AND MAC:  February, March, April, May   June, July, August, September  You don't know the song. You don't know the song. There was a good bounce to it. All right, well, either way, let's do that. (sighs) Guigino's. DEE: Mm-hmm. That's a nice place. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Fresh fish daily. How do you not have fish? Two can play at that game. Banging your sister is perverted. We ever been here before? No. No, no So, so, so Catch me up. How's life? Uh, life's good, man. Things have been, uh, pretty good. I'm still working towards becoming a veterinarian. Of course. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah. And I'm still working toward my dreams of becoming a Broadway star. Getting close but just haven't quite found my traction. Right. FRANK: Mmm, that's okay. You got time. DEE: Yeah. Youse are young. You're what, 25, 26? Yeah. Eh, give it a few more years. If it doesn't work out, you move on. (chuckles) Mm-hmm. I mean, y-you don't want to be almost 40 working at a bar. Right. Nope. No way. I know that I've been a lousy dad, but there's only one person to blame for that: your whore mother. Mmm. I don't like who she turned me into. The big house, the big car. I'm giving it all away. To charity. Well, that is a great idea. I thought you'd give me a lot of shit for that. Oh, no. Man, who do you think we are? Oh, my gosh. No, we are super into helping people in need and poor people and Yeah. Y-Y-Yeah, y-yeah. Dennis and I, we work very closely with a charity that, uh, that offers relief for the Haiti disaster. There was a disaster in Haiti? (stammering): Oh, oh, had that not, had that had not to d was it? Yeah, I-I just got to look a quick thing up on my phone if DENNIS: Um, s Dad, uh Whoa, wh-wh-wh-wh-whoa. What's that? What is that? My phone? That's a phone?! I've never seen anything like it in my life. That's because I invented it. You invented that? Yep. That is genius. Yeah, isn't it? Dennis, I always thought you'd be the one to move out in front. No, it was her, but it was her after me, because, um, she actually came up with that after I had already invented this. You invented that? Yeah, I invented this first, and then she copied me. Well, you know what I did? I upgraded it. I made it better. Oh. And I was worried that you were gonna spend the rest of your lives in that crap bar. (all laugh) No, we're killing it. Well, here's to your futures. Hey, all right. (laughs) (laughing): Oh, Dee, you bitch. This is great, Charlie. I am going to show you what life could be like without Frank. Yeah, except the first time we came here with Frank, we brought home two strippers, so Yeah, but he banged both of them. Uh, true, yeah. This time, you and I are gonna be the ones that bang the strippers. Right. Well, why do you want to bang them? Oh. 'Cause it's 2006, and you're still into women. (chuckles) Crazy. Huh? You're not You haven't become Just drop it, just drop it, just drop it. Yeah, I-I'll drop it. Hey! Frankie, what's up, man? Wait, wait, wait, wait. What are you doing here? I thought you were out with your kids. You mind if I sit down? Yeah, absolutely not. Pop a squat, Frankie. Goddamn it, I-I Oh, my God. You poor baby. What happened to your head? Ooh. Eh, it's nothing-- just a little scratch. STRIPPER: No, it looks infected. FRANK: It does? Maybe give you a lap dance? (laughing, chattering) Whoa. Make yourself at home-- welcome to mi casa. You got any booze? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah-- in the bed, under the pillow. Oh, oh. Oh, gosh. I love it, it's so spacious. It's one goddamn room. You have a steak knife in your bed. Oh, well, that's Frank's, uh Um, that is my toe knife. It's your what? Uh, that's my t-toe knife. For, you know, digging the scum out of my toes It's disgusting, disgusting. and cutting my nails off. Y-You cut your toenails with a knife? Yeah. Well, yeah. He does. I mean, it's, uh Gross. a cleaner cut, really. scum out of my toenail. Oh, botched toe. That is disgusting. FRANK (echoing): Toe knife. Maybe I ought to try that. I don't think you should; can I talk to you outside for a second? Just one second. Thank you. All right, all right. Man. Dude, we have to stop what's going on in there. Why? We're about to bang a couple strippers. Don't you see? We're making the same mistakes that we made with Frank years ago. Don't you understand? He is on a bang path straight to the waitress. Oh, shit. All right, definitely want to avoid that. All right, let's pull him. Okay, yeah. Let's pull him out. He locked us out. He did?! Yes. So it is 2006. DEE AND DENNIS:  I'll be gone till November   I'll be gone till November   Yo, tell my girl I'll be gone till November  You know what, say what you want about Wyclef, he may have stolen money from his own people, but that man can write a goddamn song. Oh, nice. Right? He's an excellent songwriter. And that is an excellent song. Mm-hmm. But, Dee, Dee, look. I want to talk to you about something, okay? We have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity here. Yes. We have a real second chance. I know. S-So I want to talk to you about our future. Yes. Should we get into it? Yes. All right, here, sit down for a second. Okay. 'Cause in order to do that, I think we're gonna have to get real. Okay. And I want to get very real with you right now.
 Yeah, go ahead.
 Can I do that? Because I feel like I'm almost coddling you. Interesting. But that's neither here nor there. I just want to get real with you f-for a second, okay? Yeah, go ahead. So the acting thing. Mm-hmm. It's done. But it's been done for a long time. I mean, you were too old in 2006. You're way too old now. And you're bad at it. Thank you. For your honesty. Yeah, is it are you cool? Oh, so much do I appreciate you for that. Thank you. Okay, good. That must have been hard for you. It was. To say. Can I be honest with you? I-I need you to. Right? Right. Okay, so the veterinarian thing. Yeah. I feel like the only reason you wanted to be a vet was to keep the skins. What? You want to keep the skins, don't you? There's no denying the skins are fascinating. It's the most fascinating part of the animal. The skin of any animal is the most fascinating part, Mmm but that's not why I wanted to become Also you're going bald. I'm going bald?! What are you talking about?! Just in in the interest of being real. Where in the hell am I possibly going bald? In the back of your head There's no evidence of that. There's quite a bit of ev I'll get two mirrors; I'll show it to you. Don't get mirrors, because You're not gonna find anything. I see fat spilling over the back of your pants on a pretty regular basis. (stammers) What the hell are you talking about?! I'm just trying to let you know. And by the way, there's no reason why a bald man who enjoys skins who has a little bit of extra something-something around his belly can't be a goddamn veterinarian! Okay, you know what, I can act! You are a wrinkled bitch! I'm gonna tell you something, my characters are good. Okay, let's stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. I-I don't want to do this with you, okay? Do you see what's happening? We're We just jumped right back in; we just leapt right back in. Into our old routines. Same old place. And I-I don't want to do that, okay? 'Cause Let's just focus here. Here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna polish off this wine. Yeah. And then we're gonna open up a new bottle of vino. Ooh. (chuckles) And let's talk about our real futures.  I'll be gone till November  To new beginnings.  And tell my girl, yo, I'll be gone till  (alarm rings) (groans) Dennis. Dennis, wake up. Aah. (groans) I'm up, I'm up, I'm up. Look what we did. (groans) Is that a crack pipe? Yes. No, no. (groaning): No. No, no, no. How'd this happen again? (groans) Well, it looks like we drank everything in the entire world, and then we went out and bought some crack, and we smoked it. Yeah, a-a-all right, that's fine. No, n-no, we just, we we slipped up. It's-it's not a big deal. Like, we'll you know, we'll pull ourselves together, and we'll, you know, we'll get back on crack. I mean, on track. Unless, um, you have more crack. No, Dennis, I don't have more crack. No one in the history of crack has ever woken up in the morning with more crack. (sighs) Okay, but if I'm being honest with you, if I'm being very, very real, I need to be high on crack cocaine right now. You know what we can do? I've got a great idea. Once we get Frank's money, we'll just take all of that money and put ourselves in rehab, 'cause we're not gonna stop smoking crack. It's all I'm thinking about. All right, so we just got to figure out another way to get some money. I have a idea. Hi. I'm a recovering crackhead, and this is my donkey-brained sister that I take care of. (hums) I'd like some welfare, please. You're a recovering crack addict, and your sister has the brains of a donkey? Mmm. We thought that you might be a little bit skeptical, so we brought proof. Dee? Well, you clearly replaced the name Frank with the name Dee, and you crossed out the word "not" on this document. Nevertheless, I do not know what the hell this document is. Well, that's that's an official State's, uh I'm gonna go ahead and stop you. None of this matters to me. So I don't need the whole song and dance. If you want welfare you'll just have to fill out a bunch of this paperwork, 'cause I'm done with this bullshit. This is good news. This is great, isn't it? Oh, yeah. I mean, times have really changed. They have, I know. You just fill out the paperwork now. You don't have to prove anything, you know what I mean? You just get the money now. Obama just gives you the money; it's great. There's a lot of paperwork to fill out, though. Yeah, could you write faster? I need some more crack. I'm starting to come down pretty hard. Okay, listen, Dee, I'm writing as fast as I can, okay? I-I also want crack. Sorry. I don't get why we're coming here to find a roommate. You know, what about living with the waitress, too? The waitress is not going to live with you. This is our only option, okay? People in the welfare store are in a pinch, so are you. Yeah, that's a good point. Uh Wait. Is that Dennis and Dee? Hi. Hey, guys. Wh-What are you doing here? Yeah, did you get Frank to write the check? Dude, we're well on our way. (chuckles) Yeah, but in the meantime, we came here because we need some money to buy crack. You guys are smoking crack again? It's not a big deal, because, uh, as soon as we get that check from Frank, we're just gonna zip right off to a-a rehab program. Yeah, we'll get in rehab. You guys are back on crack, Frank brought strippers back to my place, we're all bumping into each other at the welfare store, and yet I'm the only person who thinks it's 2006.  You, you got what I need  Oh What? It's him! It's him, everyone, shut up. Oh, it's Frank, shut up! Okay? Shh. Hey, Frank. Daddy. Daddy. Yeah. Hi, how are you? What's up? No shit. No shit! Yes, we will be there in just a few minutes. Okay, bye! What is it, what do you Oh, shit, great news, guys. Great news. No problem with the check. We just gotta meet with his money man and he's just gonna write it to us. Big fat check for us. Oh, my God, yes. We're going to see money man. Get rid of that! All right. Let's go get some crack. Yeah. I mean the check. We're gonna Right, yeah. Get some crack. (exhales) Still need a roommate, right? Yeah, what about this guy? Oh, come on, man. Don't just do that, you know? Knew you were gonna do that. Anyone else. Look at him. WOMAN: Mr. Reynolds. Lauren Kerwin. We spoke earlier. Hello, toots. Hello. (Frank cackles) Yeah, so where's Jer-Bear? Mr. Doran? Oh, um he-he passed away. (laughing) He passed Jerry! Jerry, come on in here, don't give me that. Don't make your secretary pull that bit on us. Come on, Jerry. Um, I'm not his secretary and he's been dead for years. Really. So Uh well, anyway, my kids turned me on to an idea last night. Yeah. All right, look, tell 'em about your invention. Well, the charity that Huh? Not the, not the charity. The phone. The phone-- they're being modest. Tell her, show her about the phone. Show the broad the phone. (exhales) You goddamn bitch! You wouldn't know a good idea if it smacked you in a tit. She's gonna be gone by 2007, you mark my words. DENNIS: She's a stupid stupid idiot. Yes, she's a dumb dumb bitch. A stupid moron. So, those people on Haiti. Now we can help them with the mon-- your money. No, no Haiti? Haiti's a lost cause. You might as well sink that goddamn island. What are you talking about? DEE: (gasps) No, not a lost cause, no, you said you wanted to help poor people. I am going to help the poor people. I'm gonna help you, because you are my children and I gotta think of your future. W-What? This is for you. (inhales) There you go. (both inhale sharply) Oh! Oh, that's a lot of zeroes! Oh, Dee Yeah, that's a lot of zeroes. Yeah. We will. Oh, Daddy, we're gonna do such good things with this money. Yes. We're gonna help people, we're gonna invent. Let's do it now, though. Let's move. Yeah, we'll go deposit it. Invent, invent, invent, invent, right. That was a very good decision-- thank you! Do it right away, do it right away. (Dee giggles) You're a great dad. Oh, Daddy! You're a great dad. You're right. (echoing): You are crackheads, children. MAC: I want to thank you, gentlemen, for your interest in the roommate position. You're both excellent candidates. We have Edgar and Trevor, who is an aspiring jazz musician. That's interesting, because Charlie is actually a musician himself. Mmm, don't really care for jazz, though. A lot of unnecessary notes. (door opens) FRANK: Hey! Got room for one more? Frank, what are you doing here? Charlie, the other night was the greatest night of my life. I used to live like that, in filth and squalor. I want to do it again. Absolutely not. We are not doing this again. You know what? I'm gonna consider it. Gah Frank, have a seat. Oh, Charlie. Yeah, yeah, have a seat, all right. Yeah, yeah. All right, let's begin. Okay, uh, first topic is cat food. You want to lead with that? Mm-hmm. Cat food. Yeah. Okay. You find a can of cat food in the apartment. What do you do with it? I don't do nothing with it. Don't touch my shit, I don't touch your shit. Great. Okay. He-he doesn't touch your shit Yeah. That was very clear. and then you don't So eloquent. Very clear. What are you writing? I filled in half the can of cat food. It's sort of a half-full answer. Great. Trevor, your position on the matter? I'd ask if the can is yours, and, uh, if so, would you like me to feed the cat? Oh Oh, see, now he assumes that you have a cat. Right. Smart. He doesn't have a cat. CHARLIE: Yeah, so Oh. Yeah. Kind of a waste to-to feed a cat that's not mine. For me, it depends on how hungry I was. Or sleepy. Oh, very interesting. Couple of points for Frank right there. W-Why? Well, I don't understand. He gets points for Yeah, eating it and then Well, if I was hungry and the cat food was there, I'd eat it. And if you were sleepy If I couldn't go to sleep You would I would eat the cat food and go to sleep. 'Cause it might make you go to sleep! All right. In what scenario do you not eat the cat food? I would always eat the cat food. Yeah, no. Exactly right. See, now there's a man who's-who's thinking on his feet. MAC: Trevor is a great roommate. He's a nice guy; he doesn't have the experience, though. Experience? In what? Well, all these good things. Let's keep talking. Hey, I'm sorry, am I too late? Oh. Wow, hi. What-what are you doing here? I called her, actually. I left her a message 'cause I thought she might need a place to live. The last couple of years have been pretty rough on me, and now I'm living in a women's shelter, so Oh Yeah, I figured that. 'Cause she's the worst. Is the apartment still available or not? Well, yeah, it's definitely available. Great. Yes! Oh, I've brokered a deal! Oh, no, come on, Charlie. I-I'm sorry, Frank, but you know I'm not gonna give up an opportunity to have The Waitress as a roommate. A roommate? N-n-n no, no. No, no, you did not say that. You did not say he would still be living here. MAC: That's true, I did not say that, because I didn't think you would come if I did. Yeah, well, you're goddamn right I wouldn't have come. I am not living with Charlie. Are you kidding? I would rather live on the streets. You'd rather live on the streets? Yeah. What? Ow! Ow, my God! What are you doing? Put me down! What the hell are you doing? Charlie, what are you doing? Ow! I was gonna throw her out the window and send her back to 2006! You were going to throw me out the window? What the hell is wrong with you?! CHARLIE: It's a time portal! Back in time! We could start over again! (arguing continues) This is really good. (echoing): This is ham soaked in rum. Rum ham, rum ham. and make me another. Rum ham! Who wants rum ham? (screaming) Rum ham. You are such a psycho. CHARLIE: The window is a time portal to 2006. What is he talking about? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What the hell's everybody doing in my apartment? We having a gang bang? Oh, my God. Get get the hell out of my way. Welcome back, Frankie! (laughing) Oh, the farts, man. That's good. Oh. Oh, the fart. TELLER: Yeah, sorry, I can't cash this check. Why? I mean, I know the number's really, really big, but the check is real. Are you sure you Oh, yeah, yeah. That's a real check. No, it's outdated. No, he just wrote it yesterday. No, it is clearly dated 2006.  Oh, baby, you got what I need  Goddamn it. Son of a bitch.                      CHARLIE: Holy shit! Holy shit, that is steep. Trust me, this is the best way to learn. CHARLIE: See, this is why I don't like leaving Philly, man. This is nuts. You're gonna be fine, man. The mountain is a majestical place where you push your limits and you maximize your potential. No, the mountain is a place where you party, man, have fun. That's what it's all about. Yeah, like those '80s movies. Yeah, but we're not in a movie. I mean, we're gonna get hurt. We're not gonna get hurt. For some reason, the rules are just different on the mountain. The rules for what? Everything, dude. You've seen those '80s movies. What do I do with my hands? How do I ski? Well, you're supposed to have poles. Uh You know what, hold on to these guys for balance. These are glass. Yeah. And don't break 'em, bitch. What is this, a double black diamond? I wish it was a triple black. Dudes, let's shred.   (wind whistling)    I remember   One girl   Saw her again   In a magazine   Front cover   Big star   Showing things   That I'd never seen   Well, maybe  (whooping) Whoo, yeah! Still got it, baby! Rip city! Wonder how Charlie's doing. Oh, here he comes.   (yelling) DEE: Whoa! Whoa! Uh (laughs) Yeah! (cheering, whooping)   MAN (over P.A.): Another beautiful day at Alpine Ridge. End of the season is right around the corner, so get those turns in while you can, and don't forget to sign up for the big race this Sunday, which will determine the best skier on the mountain. CHARLIE: That was totally insane. I mean, I can't believe you guys can ski like that. Hmm? It's just nuts. I'm not doing it again, man. What are you talking about? It's so dangerous. No. You did a great job, man. Hey, look, is your body hurt? No. You okay? Yeah. That's 'cause it's mountain rules, man. I don't get that, though. I just feel like I got lucky. Nah. You just need to learn to use your edges a little bit more. Learn to turn DEE: Right down the mountain! AprÃ¨s-ski! Let's get our drink on! No, I don't think I'm gonna be doing that. I'm gonna get a sensible meal, head back to my room, log in my times, chart my progress, 'cause I'm gonna win. Win what? At skiing. MAN: Oh, hey. What's shakin', brother? Oh, what's shakin'? Well, I'll tell you what's shakin'-- these skis, quite literally. Now, I need these things waxed and sharpened by 8:00 a.m. I want to make first tracks. No problemo. Anything else? You guys need helmets? Uh, I'll take a helmet. While you're back there, could you slap a sticker on the side of mine that says "pussy"? Yeah, I feel you, babe, but those are the rules. Whatever, dude. Probably what makes skiing so fun is that your brains could get bashed in, in any moment. Mm-hmm. Yeah, it didn't used to always be this way. This used to be Party Mountain. Hot babes, cold brews. And now I hear some corporate stooge wants to turn this place into a private resort for rich CEOs. They can't do that to Party Mountain. It's not called Party Mountain. It's called Alpine Ridge. There's one of those yuppie vultures now. MAC: Don't worry. We got this covered. Show this fat-cat asshole what's what! Eat this, bitch! (laughing) MAC: Oh, shit. What'd you do that for? DEE: Oh, sorry, Frank. We thought you were some jerk-off who bought the mountain. I am the jerk-off who bought the mountain. What?! I'm turning it into a members-only resort for millionaires to plow their trophy whores in private. Whoa! That sounds amazing, Frank. I'm in. I'm in. What are you talking about? And ruin Party Mountain? MAC: You know, who cares about your stupid plans? Let's go rage, Dee. Hang on a second. I-I'm, like, so lost. So, uh, who do I go with in this situation? Well, that depends, Charlie. You could go drink cheap beer amongst swine and savages, like you would on any other day, or you could get the most out of this mountain. And you could get the most out of yourself by joining an elite class of athletes and gentlemen alike. Right, Frank? Yes. Huh. That sounds kind of cool. Yeah. All right, you guys go-- why should I go with you? Go with them. Who cares? We're here for two days. You guys it is! All right.   Hey-yo! Hey, man. Remember us from the ski shop? Ah, the party guys! Hey! Yeah! Come on in. Yeah! Yeah! Awesome. Awesome. Well looks like you guys had a real shit-kicker last night, huh? Rager! Oh, oh, the cans. No, no, we're just recycling to help pay the rent. Oh. Mm. That's my roommate, Turkey. We call him Turkey, 'cause his favorite drink is Wild Turkey. Awesome! Yes! Oh, badass! Like your suit, too. What are you, coming from a Gatsby party? No, I was in court all day. I was trying to win back custody of my daughter. Oh. Mm. (chuckles): That's a bit of a downer. Yeah. Yeah, pretty much. Hey. Hey, Roach. Roach, come meet some people. Who stole my goddamn burrito? No, it's there, Roach. I just moved it to make room for my coleslaw. Look. Did you mess with it? Did you come in it? Did you come in my burrito?! I didn't come in your burrito! I wouldn't do that to you! He's a little squirrelly from the concussions. Like I said, no helmets back in the day. Guys, I got to admit, this is, uh it's not as much of a party vibe as it is a, uh A pathetic vibe. Yeah. MAC (chuckles): Yeah, I mean, come on, this used to be Party Mountain, you know, and and Babe Manor, that's the capital of Party Mountain. Yeah. When was the last time you even had a babe in here? Oh, uh my daughter stopped by about six weeks ago. Served me a court summons. I say count it. No, don't. Don't count it. Oh, guys, guys, guys, guys, don't you miss the old days, when you were the kings of this mountain? You used to rip sweet powder, then come home and crush brews. I do. Let's take back this mountain! Why don't you guys dig deep and show me those inner party animals. Let's crush some brews! Let's empty some cans! Yeah! Whoo! Yeah! Hey, hey, hey! Rent money! No, no. No, no, no, no, no. Whoa, no, no. Drink 'em. Drink 'em. Oh, yeah, it's been so long, I forgot. Let's drink 'em, Whoo! then recycle! Yeah! Sure. Yeah. Okay.   FRANK: high-speed lifts, five-star lodging, and a state-of-the-art spa. Snow Palace. Well, Frank, it's marvelous. Thank you. There's only one thing missing. What's that? The Dennis Reynolds Ski Academy. CHARLIE: Could be a a good idea to get a model of that. What are you doing? Hmm? What are you doing, eating a tree? Yeah, I thought this was made out of candy. It's a plastic tree, Charlie. It's not made out of candy. You said that this was a candy model. I never said it was a candy model. I believe I heard you mention it was a model made out of candy. FRANK: Well, let's just focus on the banquet that I'm having tomorrow night to entice local investors. It'd be a good idea to get a model of the banquet. We could make that candy. I'd like to get a visual on that banquet. And we may as well make it candy. It should be candy. All right, look, forget about the model, all right? Let's not talk about the model. The only model that you should know is Tatiana. Tatiana, come in here. Meet Tatiana. She came all the way from Bulgaria to hand-deliver her finest caviar. Nicely done, Frank. She'll be a fitting reward for me after I win the big race. Until then, Tatiana, I want you to clean yourself, for I will enter you hard and deep, and it will last for as long or as short as I please. But you will be clean. Only when you are clean will you know my power. (cheering, music playing in distance) What the hell is that? It sounds like a party. (Kenny Loggins' "Footloose" playing) Go, go, go, go, go, go! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! (whooping) Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! This is so great. I can't thank you enough. I feel alive again. And look at all the cans. We're gonna be rich! You got to drop it with the cans, all right? Nobody cares about the cans. Really. Yep. Oh, okay, well, what about these cans? Oh! Oh, my God! You can't do that! You can't do that. Though they don't seem to mind. They look like they're really enjoying it. Yeah, mountain rules, baby! Everybody get your tits out! (cheering) Hell yes! He just said, "Take your tits out," Yeah. and they all just took their tits out. Yeah, I'm gonna keep mine in, just for now. (music stops) Party's over, burnout. Whoops. Frank Reynolds. Wow. It's been How they hanging, Drisko? Uh, I lost one of 'em. Prostate thing. You know. Yeah, yeah, me, too. It's still bouncing around in there, but it don't do nothing. I'm gonna stop this. You guys know each other? We skied together. This mountain wasn't big enough for both of us. Loser of the big race was banned for 30 years. Looks like old Frank here let his mouth write a check his ass couldn't cash. (crowd oohing) Huh. Well, I just wrote another check. To buy the mountain. (crowd groaning) How 'bout we race for the mountain? Or are you scared you'll lose? (oohing) I don't race no more. I let my son race for me. Oh! Really? Your son, huh? Don't think you can beat me? Oh, I'll beat you. You better go enjoy your party while it lasts. It's gonna be your last one. Burnout. (cackles) MAN (over P.A.): Last day to squeeze in some turns before tomorrow's big race. On a side note, it's good to see Frank Reynolds back on the hill. We'll see if he can patch things up with old rival, Dave Drisko. But I wouldn't count on it. Yo, hey, Dennis, did you just hear that? What? The-the P.A. announcement. What-what was that? Well, there's a lot of people on this mountain, Charlie. Everybody's gotta stay informed. Yeah, but that guy was, like, saying a bunch of, like, really personal information about us. Like, how does he know that? Right. That's how it works. Why's he talking about us? There's, like, hundreds of people out here. Well, we're the most important thing that's happening right now. What? Look, I-I think I got something that's gonna clear this all up for you. Meet my race team. Where'd these guys come from? Switzerland? Yeah, but they came here and they're racing with us? I don't I-I don't understand that at all. Well, I needed somebody to be behind me. I mean, this guy's my kind of my captain, and these guys are my goons, you know? If I need 'em to do something for me, back me up, you know, if I'm getting into some And they just showed up and they're racing with you? Yeah. All right. No more questions. Okay, good. All right. Uh, yeah, I-I Okay. (scoffs) All right, now, listen up, guys. Tomorrow's the big race. And anything less than first place will not be tolerated. In fact, it'll be punished. But, remember, I want you to have fun. But not if it means you're not gonna get first place. 'Cause I'll-I'll punish you. All right, now go limber up, and I'll-I'll meet you at the chair. Let's go, guys. March, march, march. Wow. Uh, I got to hand it to you, looks like you got a pretty good team. I think so, too. Yeah, yeah. Uh, look, I don't I don't get anything that's happening. So, uh, I'm out, you know what I mean? And maybe we should drink some beer, eat some snow, and just (bottle shatters) What the hell, man? I'm disappointed in you. I thought you were a champion. Why? You showed me some real stuff out there, guy. I was falling. You were falling, but you were fast. But I crashed into some tables. Crashing and exploding is all part of the learning curve. I could turn you into a champion, but that's clearly not what you want. You want to just be a burnout and a loser like those other guys. Dude, I don't even understand you, man. Just, like, take it easy Where are those coming from? I'm out, dude. Like, it's crazy to me. I'm gonna hang out with Mac and Dee and see if I can figure them out, man Oh, yeah, yeah. Go hang with those other two burnout losers. Yeah, go ahead. You know what your problem is, buddy? You got no allegiance. We're here for two days! MAN (over P.A.): Look like Charlie Kelly's walking off the mountain and out of the big race, ladies and gentlemen. He knows my name! He knows my name! DRISKO: Oh, yeah. Here we go. Take a look. Oh, wow! Can you see through the wall? Yeah. Yeah, you can see right through. Okay, I think I'm getting it. Yeah. Yeah? Okay.
 Hey! I heard your guys' voices. What are you guys doing in here?
 DEE and MAC: Hey! We are in the middle of a prank war with Frank and Dennis. Yeah. All right, nice. What's the prank? What's the prank? We're drilling a hole in the women's shower so we can look at 'em naked. Yeah. (laughing) Why? What-what does that have to do with Frank and Dennis? I don't know. I don't know. Well, nothing, really. It's just a warm-up prank to get the juices flowing. Yeah! (chuckling) Warm-up. We're warming up. I don't want to be a bummer, but I kind of don't get how spying on naked, unaware women is a prank at all. MAC: Me, either. Me, either. Me, either. Well, the real prank DEE: Mm-hmm. is when I jam my dick through that hole and yell, "Special delivery!" Oh, dude, I don't think so. CHARLIE: Oh, no. You can't do that, man. You'd get in a lot of trouble for something like that. That's, like Yeah. Maybe we can just do something that doesn't involve naked women. Just You know, 'cause that's not fun for me. How 'bout if I show you my dick? Why would I want that? Oh, okay, okay, it's a prank if you don't want to see it but he shows you anyway. This guy gets it. It's gonna be hilarious. I think I get it. I'm gonna get myself hard, and I will show you what I mean. Hold on a sec. Oh. Oh. (grunting) Oh, you bastard! You know what, if you guys are already hard, just go ahead of me and I'll-I'll just circle back. Oh, God. (Rick Springfield's "Jessie's Girl" playing)  Jessie is a friend   Yeah, I know he's been a good friend of mine   But lately something's changed   It ain't hard to define   Jessie's got himself a girl  CHARLIE: Shit.  And I want to make her mine   And she's watching him with those eyes   And she's loving him with that body   I just know it   Yeah, and he's holding her  Hello, Charlie. Oh, my God. Uh, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to spy. I was just walking by; I'm not a Peeping Tom. Oh, Charlie, I do not mind. We are on the mountain. (chuckles): Yeah. What does that mean? Everyone keeps saying, "We're on the mountain," but I-I don't get it, you know what I mean? Look, where I come from, you know, jamming your dick through a hole in the wall, that-that's assault, that's a felony, and, uh, it's just plain wrong. Something bothering you, Charlie? You do not like my breasts? Uh, no, no, your breasts your breasts are great. Do you want to jump in with me in the hot tub now?   Yeah. You know, um Yeah. Yeah. I'm gonna stop complaining about the mountain. I'm just gonna, I'm gonna let the mountain work for me. Now we're talking. (laughing): My! Here we go.  You know, I wish that I had Jessie's girl   I wish that I had Jessie's girl   Where can I find a woman like that?   Like Jessie's girl   I wish that I had Jessie's girl     Where can I find a woman   Where can I find   A woman like that?  (playing jazz melody) MAN (over P.A.): Welcome to the annual big race. Who will take home the top prize? Local free spirit Dave Drisko (loud cheering) or fierce new competitor Dennis Reynolds? (crowd jeering) The stakes are high because the loser today is walking off the mountain for 30 years. Do you realize how important this race is, Dennis? Well, yeah, 'cause he just said how important it is. I hope you got your bags packed. I'm gonna get rid of you once and for all, Frank Reynolds. I'm gonna save Party Mountain and bring back the glorious good old days. MAN: Freeze! Police! David Drisko, you're under arrest. MAC: Oh, shit! They framed Drisko so he couldn't do the big race! Oh, come on! This man has committed a litany of sexual assaults. His semen was recovered from crime scenes all over the mountain. Let's go, pal. Lose the hat. (gasps, groans, laughter) This guy might not be as cool as we thought he was. Even his awesome hair is bullshit. You forgot one charge. What's that? Assaulting an officer! Never stop partying! Oh! That'll do. You know? Let them keep thumping ass. He probably deserves it. Yeah. Never stop partying. Never stop partying! So which one of you losers wants to win a silver medal? Ugh. Not me-- I got blasted last night. I'm so sick. I don't feel good, either. I'd also like to remove myself from the sexual predator team. (over P.A.): Well, I guess that does it. The winner by default of the annual big race is CHARLIE: Not so fast! (crowd oohing and aahing) (chuckles) This is good. So you gonna race for them? No, Dennis, I'm gonna race for everyone. I want to race for the people. (whooping, cheering) You see, last night Tatiana taught me all about Communism. Cold, hard winters, gross soups. She also taught me a lot about sex. Sweet sex, amazing sex, a lot of sex, Jacuzzi sex, Dennis!  Jessie's girl    It was amazing. So I get it now-- I like the mountain. I understand the rules. And I'm gonna shred. Well this ought to be rich. (chuckles) (cackling) (continues cackling) (mocking): Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!   (cheering, whooping)   He's-he's getting destroyed. (loud crack) CROWD: Oh! Oh! My ankles are broken! (yells) My ankles are broken for sure! His ankles are broken! He has broken his ankles! Oh, they're surely broken! Charlie can still win! (cheering) Go, Charlie! MAC: Come on, Charlie! Little faster! Come on! A little faster, bud. DEE: Straighten out! (grunting) No! No! No! No! (fierce yell) Yeah! Ah, shit! Okay. DENNIS: I won! DEE: All right. The mountain is ours, Frank! (laughing) Uh not exactly. Uh actually, uh the whole Snow Palace thing was, uh, all for show. (groans) Huh? I needed to distract the local environmentalist groups while I fracked the mountain. Wh-Wh What?! You fracked the mountain? Yeah. Yeah, the banquet, the race-- it was all set up. It was just a diversion, it was a distraction, because I wanted to get into this hill and suck out its natural resources. So all this here was just one big setup? Yeah. I hired the hookers, so you could rip their tops off. That makes sense. Oh That makes a lot of sense. So what do we do now? I'm good. You want to you want to stick around, it's okay. No. It'd be good to go back to Philly, right? I mean I'm pretty tired. It was quite a weekend. Honestly, I don't even like skiing that much. (groaning): I-I need to go see a doctor. Yeah, I should probably see a doctor, too, actually, I guess, if Tatiana was a hooker. Oh, yeah. Oh, God, gross. Yeah. That's not good. (groans) MAN (over P.A.): Well, folks, you heard it. Frank fracked the mountain, and it looks like we'll all be out of jobs. DENNIS: Oh God! So, did you even hire that guy? You know, Charlie, I have no idea who that guy is. Huh. I guess some things really are different on the mountain. Yeah.  Uh-huh   Whoo!                         DEE: Hey, guys. Here we go.
 I'm ordering it. MAC: Drop the bluff, Dee. No one believes you're in an actual movie. You guys are gonna feel hella stupid when you see me acting in a feature film. "Hella." Are we saying "hella" now? 'Cause I like it. No, we're not saying "hella," okay? No. Nobody's saying "hella" anymore. I never really got to say it. "Hella" came and went. Me, neither. Dee, can we watch something else? Can we watch, like, a superhero movie or something? This is such a waste of our Oh, that's a nice opening shot. Symmetrical vista. It's beautiful. MAC: Directed by Pedro Vyes. Who's he? He's, like, this foreign art house director. Oh. Ooh Foreign director. Very impressive. Okay, you guys, be quiet. This is my scene. Pretty early for a whiskey. Or pretty late. Why don't you make it a double. Oh, yeah? A little hair of the dog that bit you? (chuckles) MAC: Yeah, Dee, I got to hand it to you. Y-You've been talking about doing this for years, and Is that Richard Grieco? Hi. Aw, Grieco. I love that guy. Where's he been? Richard Grieco is in an art house movie? That seems odd. That's a little strange. Yeah, it's a little stra But, you know, they-they always got to get some kind of a name
 in order to finance the mo Oh, now he's being blown.
 DEE: Right. (gang exclaiming, laughing) Okay. Now-now this makes sense. So, Dee, you clearly made a porn. This is a porno! What? No? It's not a porn. You guys, the-the foreigners, they have a much more evolved view of sex. This is this is art. (woman grunting) (moans) Dee, what channel did you order this from? Cinemax. ALL: Cinemax?! Dee, Cinemax doesn't make art. You guys, Pedro is-is an edgy, foreign director. Where's he from? Puerto Rico. Oh! Puerto Rico? Puerto Rico? Puerto Rico! MAC: Oh, man. Dee, you made a Skinemax flick with a Puerto Rican pervert. Congratulations. Good thing you got us all together. Listen, hey, I did not make a smut film. GRIECO: Gobble that cock. (laughter) MAC: Now, why is Grieco resorting to Skinemax? He's got a great career. He's doing fine. Actually, it makes sense. I mean, erotic films are very, very in right now. I mean, Grieco probably didn't realize he was doing a porn. I think he thought he was doing the next Fifty Shades of Grey or whatever. I mean, it's a it's a fine line these days between art and smut. It really is. Art's a tricky thing. The whole art world is bullshit nowadays. I mean, like, anything can be considered art. I'll bet you Charlie's doodlings could be considered art by some people. Well, that's 'cause my drawings are art. You're not an artist, dude. You're drawing with chalk. No, I'm drawing with marker and, like, pen and stuff. I'm just eating the chalk. Charlie, don't eat chalk. Well, it settles my stomach. My stomach's a little If your stomach hurts, eat a Tums. What's the difference? One is chalk! Well, I don't like wasting Tums. Tums is very good to draw with. This maniac is an artist? I'll bet you if I hung one of Charlie's doodles in a modern art gallery, people would not know the difference. Mm. No. No, I disagree. No, art has to come from a more meaningful place. It can't just be silly nonsense. I mean, take my erotic memoirs, for example. (chuckles) Now, that was art. That was smut. No, dude, what I do is art. And you know what else? I think I should film it. Yeah. I mean, guys, I'd be a fool not to ride this erotic tidal wave our culture seems to be on, film it, do the next Fifty Shades of Grey, my style, you know? My film would be real, it would be tasteful, it would be it would be subtle. It wouldn't be some goddamn Puerto Rican smut. I'm down to try this, like, art gallery idea of yours. What do you think Grieco would do? He wouldn't eat chalk. Yes, but I just don't understand why you're choosing to dress like Richard Grieco. Well, because he's a cool bro and I'm a cool bro. I just want to do a Grieco thing. I'm vibing with it. I'm vibing with it, man. Stop saying that you're vibing and "bro." You know what, why don't you go mingle, and Frank and I will handle this. Thank you. All right, you do it. All right, Frank. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Leave him alone. Look, here's a spot. Here's a spot. What? Yeah. Just keep keep an eye out. Okay. That's good. That's good. Mmm. (quietly:) Oh, yeah. Looks perfect. Oh, wow. I like this one. Oh. That's art. That's art. I like that piece. Yes, that's MAC (whispering): She's going for it. She loves it. She loves it. She's going for it. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! What the hell are you doing? Whoa. Hey, lady. Lady. You can't throw art in the trash. Oh, that wasn't art. It was garbage. Wait, wait, wait a second. Wait a second. I mean, how-how is that art and this is trash? I mean, who's to say, really? Well, I'm to say. It's my gallery. (chuckles) Okay. Then please explain to me how that is art and this is garbage. Well, it's all about context. The story behind each piece is part of what endows it with meaning. For example, this artist worked for 30 years before finally finding his voice. He left his home when he was a boy to escape the Nazis, fled to Paris, and painted the poor children he saw in the streets.   (man shouting in German) The ambiguity he uses to paint children and animals. (dog barking, monkey screeching) His work provokes. It raises questions. Are we children? (children chattering) Are we animals? (all sounds overlapping) Are children animals?   (overlapping sounds rewinding) MAC: If it's context you want Context. Okay. Well, the artist that did this, his life is, like, total shit. I mean, like, way worse than this Nazi painter. Oh. Hey, Charlie? Yeah, uh What-what are you doing, man? What's up, bro? Hey, uh, this is Charlie. He's the, uh he's the artist. C-Could you tell the lady how your Don't do that. Okay, can you just explain to her how your life is garbage so that she It's not sw Oh, my life's pretty sweet, bro. Hang out at a bar all day with my bros. You know? Go on lots of adventures. I'm really kind of a sweet businessman when I think about it. He's an illiterate janitor whose mother tried to abort him in Frank, Frank, tell her, please. Huh? What is it? What-what is it? It's-it's what we discussed. It's what we've been discussing. Oh. Tell her that Charlie's life is a piece of shit. Please. Thank you. I've got one of those hella sweet lives Stop saying "hella"! He doesn't he doesn't normally say "hella." I don't know where he picked this up. I'm sorry. I'm just not interested. Okay, well, wait, wait, we just need to take one I'm not interested, either. I go for more of the Pam Anderson type, you know what I mean? Oh, my God. Okay, look I'm not interested. Goddamn it. Why did I even bring you two? "A man enters. "The room wouldn't be the only thing he'd enter that day. His name was Dennis." I'm-I'm sorry-- what is happening? "Silence." Okay. "He said. 'A woman's mouth "'is not for the exiting of words "but for the entrance of a man's dick.' "And then he did put it in there. In her mouth, I mean." Okay. And then they-they have sex all over the library. Okay, I, uh, I-I'm sorry, I don't know what's happening here. You must think I'm somebody else. Look, look. Sure, I could leave here right now, I could take this to Frank and he would finance it. But he's gross, you know? He's basically, like, the Cinemax of humans. Okay, I think I'm catching up here. So you want to make a film based on the pornographic book you're reading from. Look this is my Fifty Shades of Grey, lady. All right? Was the guy who wrote that gross? It was written by a woman. Na You no, I know. That it was written by a woman. Everybody knows that. Yeah, but that's why you needed to let me get to the This was also written by a woman. Yeah. Writ-Written and to be directed by my sister. What do you think? (doorbell rings) Hey, Dee. (door closes) Dee, you're not doing anything that matters, right? You know, I think I'm finally figuring out this editing software, and I have to say I put together a pretty prime-time acting reel here. I doubt it. Don't show it to me. I don't   Pretty early for a whiskey. A little hair of the dog that bit you? Using a multi-tiered distribu Multi-level marketi The Invigaron system.   Brains.   It i it's missing something, isn't it? Nah, it's great. Uh, Dee, you know what I think the real problem, though, with the acting business is? Uh-huh? Every actor these days is a multi-hyphenate. They're doing everything-- they're writing, they're directing, you know. Mm. So here's a thought I just had. How would you like to, um, direct my erotic memoirs? I've always wanted to direct. And you want me to do it? Yeah, yeah. Smart. Smart. You bring a female perspective in. Mm-hmm. It's a very interesting layer. I like that. Yeah, it's-it's a good layer. That's really smart of you. Yeah, I'll do that. I'll do that for you. Okay, so, um great. So you'll do that, and, um Yeah, yeah. now we just need a star that we can attach on-on short notice. Don't worry, I got I got an idea. I got a lot of ideas. All right, what about this one? You know, I had a dream about, um, you know, boiled eggs. So, I, uh Okay. What do thewhat do the eggs represent? Eggs, you know? Like, uh from a chicken. Just eggs? No. Charlie, you're not getting it. I need you to draw something that's profound, you know? That comes from someplace deep. But is also childlike and stupid, to prove my point. Hey, bro, uh, maybe stop telling me what to do all the time, you know? 'Cause if you tell me what to do, then, like, you know, that's, like, I got, like, a lame, kind of square dude telling me what to do, you know? And that's not really where art comes from. Okay, you And so I'm gonna draw eggs that represent eggs, bro. And it's gonna it's gonna be hella cool, man. You're gonna like these eggs. Can I ask you a question? Do you do you want to sell this art or not? Bro, is this about making money for you or is it about proving your point? Like, I don't even know what it is, man. It's becoming about both for me. I don't know what it's becoming for you. Come on, man. I'm ripping this up. I'm ripping this up. That's it. Bro, stop ripping up my art, man! Get in there! Hey. You stink! Ugh. I found him turning tricks in the scrap metal yard. Good news, Charlie. We're gonna use Cricket now. Oh. Use me how? Use what part of me? Relax. You are gonna be the face of Charlie's art. What? Why, man? Because he's got, like, the worst life imaginable, and that's clearly what those people want. That's true, I do have the worst life. (chuckles) You know what, Cricks, why don't you come over here, why don't you tell Charlie what to draw. Okay. Tell me wh I don't want to draw his drawings. No, Charlie, this is gonna work, all right? Just jump on board, jump on board. Okay, go ahead. All right, bro bro. Oh, all right, fine. Talk to me, brother. What's up? What is he doing? He's doing, like, a Grieco thing. Okay. Uh, all right. Well, what do you want to hear about? You want to hear about a dog orgy or when a cat bit off my toe? Dog orgy, brother. CRICKET: Dog orgy. Okay. This is going great. Okay, now, Frank, I need you to go talk to that gallery owner. Convince her to come to Paddy's for an art opening that we're gonna have here. Oh. You know? Flash a little cash. Pretend you're, like, a high-society art type. Oh, I got this. I-I used to hang with an art crowd in the '70s. I know these people. O-Okay. All right. But-but play it subtle, all right? Subtle. Yeah. Frank. Play it subtle. I got it. (whispers): Subtle. Hello! Hello? Ango Gablogian, the art collector. Charmed, I'm sure. Yes. I'm gonna invite you to a show. Okay. But first allow me to destroy your gallery. Bullshit. Bullshit. Derivative. That I love. I absolutely love. Um, that's just the air conditioner. I want it. It's everything. I mean, look at us. We're just air conditioners. I mean, after all, we're just walking around on the planet, breathing, conditioning the air. I condition it hot, that conditions it cold. I mean, it's symbiotic, no? No, it is. I mean, we're just the air conditioners walking around on this planet, screwing each other's brains out. So true. I never thought of it like that.   Oh hello, you. (gunfire, explosions) This room won't be the only thing that I'll be entering today.
 Hey, teach. DEE: Cut! A woman's mouth is not for exiting of words, but for the entrance of a man's penis. DEE: Cut! DENNIS: Grieco, Grieco, Grieco, come on, man. Shoot her tits. I need some I need a couple Just Get mostly tits on this one. Lots of emotion. And I want to feel a little bit of, uh, of sadness coming from your tits. And, action.
 A woman's mouth DEE: Cut! "Not for the exiting of words, it's for the entrance"
 Dee, can you just let him GRIECO: Is there really is there really a frigging difference between "exiting" and "entering"? Hey! Excuse me, every You know what? Is there a difference between "exiting" and "entering"? GRIECO: I know there is, but is there but words exit. Okay, okay, you know what? I-I need a seaweed break. Grieco, you've had 15 packages of seaweed today. Guys, Richard needs a seaweed five. Another? Oh, goddamn it! Can we just get the scene, please? Just like it was in high school? You know, about that. What exactly happened in high school? 'Cause it sounds like you had sex with a teacher. Uh, well no, she wasn't a teacher, she was a hot young librarian. Are you talking about Miss Clinsky? Yeah. She was like 50. Yeah, she looked good for her age. She looked like Rick Moranis. Moranis was always in pretty good shape, yeah. Plus, when she took her hair out of the bun, she went from Moranis to Alanis. Gross. You were 14. So, technically, you were raped. It wasn't rape. Can't rape a guy. Huh? You can't rape I was I was willing. You know, you can't rape I mean, it's cool. Like, I bedded an older woman. That's cool. Right, Grieco? You know what? Let me use your pain in the scene. What are you talking about? You can't use somebody else's pain, Grieco. Do you know how acting works? Look (exhales) Touch my finger
 and transfer your pain into me. DEE: Mm-hmm, it's a good idea. Touch touch my finger. I'm not touching your finger, man. I'm not touching your finger! Dennis. Seriously, touch my finger. What the hell is? You know what? Why don't you just shoot me doing the goddamn scene? I'll seduce the librarian. You know what? That seaweed's making me a little sick. Uh, can I get a chalk break, or something like that? Uh-oh.   I call this one "Dog Three-Way." 'Cause I was recently in a dog three-way. Actually, four with me, so, four-way. I was in a dog orgy. God, he's making a mockery of my art, bro.
 Oh. DENNIS: Well, the shoot was a total disaster. Dee's incompetent and a bitch, which we all knew. But, I mean, Richard Grieco. The man is obsessed with seaweed. It's Pump your brakes. You met Grieco? Yeah, I met Grieco. Yeah, he-he was in my movie, but, uh, it didn't go very well. What-what are you doing? Are you doing a Grieco thing? Yeah, I'm doing a Grieco thing, 'cause-'cause Grieco's the man. You know, is he the man? No, not really. Ah, he used to be big. No. Yeah, no. Hello, boys. Is that how you play it? That is way over the top. What are you talking about? This is it. This is the way they are. Frank, did you buy an air conditioner? Yes, and I bought a painting for 35 K. Why? Because I liked it, and that's what it cost. Is nobody understanding what we're trying to do? (door opens, closes) I am trying to prove that this is all bullshit, and you guys are all buying into it. Oh. Oh, ho, ho, ho. Oh, hi. Hi. Here's the darling. Oh. That sold me not a painting. Mm. A revelation. Oh. Hi, Ango. Oh, oh. WOMAN: Mm. (laughing) Oh. Oh, great. Oh, thank you. Thank you, Ango. Yes. Thank you very much. And thank you for coming. Oh. Oh, my pleasure. Yes, we have we have many paintings by our featured artist, Rickety Cricket. Ah Okay, well, Ango clearly has a great eye. I do have a great eye. So I'm excited to see what you have. Yes, yes. Well, here we have a Cricket. Oh. Yes, yes, and, uh, here we have another Cricket. Uh-huh. And, uh Oh, here we have the artist himself. This is Rickety Cricket. Hey-o. Wow. Yeah, he literally has the worst life imaginable. (laughing): He ain't lying. So now you got some perspective and some context. Uh-huh. And like a story or whatever it is that you people need, so Uh-huh. We don't have to talk numbers right now,
 but I feel like it should be DEE: Hey, guys. I figured this art opening would be the perfect place to premiere my directorial debut. No, Dee, absolutely not.
 That's a hard "no." CHARLIE: Yeah. (piano plays gentle melody) (orchestra joins in) DENNIS: Oh, come on. There were No, Dee. This is ridiculous.   _ _ _ _ _ Hey, hoser, remember when I raped you in the library? Hoser, hoser, hoser, hoser, hoser, hoser, hoser Okay, thank you. Thank you very much. I'm sorry. That was, uh That's not part of the, uh, whole thing. It's very disturbing. It's very avant-garde. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. What do you think it's all worth? Good question. Ango, what do you think? Millions. I'd trade my limbs for it. Well, the market is dictated by what people will pay, so Well, right, but how much are you willing to pay for it? Me? Yeah. (laughs) Oh, no, no. I'm really not interested in buying anything. But you own an art gallery. Oh, no. Oh. I rent an art gallery, or more accurately, my parents rent one for me. What?! So that painting I bought from you was worthless? Of course not. It meant something to you. It's worth exactly what you paid. I want to sell it back. Okay. In that exchange, it would only be worth what I would pay for it, which is, again, um, nothing. I-I don't get it. When is stuff art? Uh, hey, guys, guys, um, if I may, I think I can sum this all up. You see, art is an ambiguous thing, yeah? Yeah, just because you make some art, it doesn't mean that you're an artist. But, also, it does mean you're an artist. But does it mean that that art is good art? Is art good just because the right people say it's good? Yes. Yes. That's-that's how it works. Yeah, but keep in mind, you know, a lot of modern art is is trash. I mean, it's shitty. It's not You know, it's not good. It's terrible. You know? And yet, it's a fine line between van Gogh and Van Damme, you know, between Depp and Grieco, between Banksy and Charlie, that makes it very difficult to determine what's good art. You know, what's high art? What has worth? What has meaning? Yeah? But if one thing has become abundantly clear to me today-- and it should be to all of you, as well-- is that I wasn't raped. Hmm? We had a good time, she and I. Yeah? It was a it was a two-way road. The whole thing was mutual. And the woman in no way looked like Rick Moranis. You know? She totally did. I remember her. Remember her? Yeah. UmOh, no. I wouldn't even sleep with her.                      MAC: Hey, Dee! Dee! Dee! Dee! Do you want to take your feet off my bed, please? DEE: It's not your bed, okay? It's my goddamn floor! And how many times do I have to ask you guys to please just pick up your shit when you wake up in the morning! You're turning this place into the Superdome. Superdome? That's, like, six years too late. That's a super lame reference. And it's kind of offensive. You'll be happy to know, by the way, we are looking for a place right now. All right? What about this place, man? Ah, it looks a little bit junky. It kind of reminds me of here. Yeah, this place is a piece of shit. It's not junky, okay? You guys have destroyed everything, and that's why it looks junkier, like a couple of locusts. Oh, I take that as a compliment. It's not a compliment. Well, it's biblical, so it's a compliment. Yeah. (stammers) Why is everything so goddamn expensive? I mean, I wish we hadn't burned down our rent-controlled apartment. (both laugh) Yeah, you think? Dee, I will slap you in the teeth. You think this is easy? We-we have a list of demands here. We need two bedrooms. We-we need two bathrooms, minimum. You know what? Whatever. What's your plan? Where are you guys gonna find a place that fits all of your needs for under 1,500 bucks a month? DENNIS: Well, guys, this is it. Welcome to our beautiful new home. CHARLIE: This is crazy. You guys should've just moved into that empty apartment in our building. The one where the family was murdered? Brutally murdered. Pass. This place is awesome. You guys are gonna thrive out here, and I am not gonna have to worry about you hogging my shower anymore. And we don't have to worry about getting ringworm. You brought the ringworm. Yeah, and now your apartment is infested with it. Yeah. Don't worry, you'll be back to giving each other worms soon enough. These are city scum. They can't hack it out here. Oh, yeah? Yeah. You want to bet? Absolutely. Okay, Frank. So if Mac and I can live here for a month, then you have to pay our rent for an entire year. Deal. And if you don't, you have to sleep in bed with an old man for a year. (laughing): Gross! What? Yeah. What are you laughing about, Charlie? You already sleep with an old man, and for no reason other than you seem to enjoy it. (laughing) Yeah. Okay, you know what, Frank? You got a bet. Won't last a month-- Frank is insane! This place is paradise, man. We can really stretch out, you know? It-it's quiet, it's calm. It's not like the city where everything is so stressful, you know? I'm-I'm just I feel at ease. When was the last time that we had a home-cooked meal? Oh, dude (stammers) it's been forever. Well, my friend, dig in. Mmm. Oh, my God. Mac this is incredible. You like it? Oh, my God. Oh, that is such a relief because I worked so hard on it. Yeah. I call it Mac's famous mac and cheese. (laughing) Okay, well, I don't know how I don't really know how famous it is. I mean, I'm your roommate, and I've never heard of it. So, what do you want to do after dinner? Uh well, see, the TV's not hooked up, so can't watch TV. Um, there's not really any bars around here, so Right. You know what we should do? Hmm? Let's just get a good night's sleep. That's a good idea. Yeah. (faint chirp nearby) Yeah. What was that? What was what? (chirps again) You hear that, that chirping sound? I did not, no. Probably a smoke detector or something like that, huh? Right, yeah. No big deal. Hey, to a great night's sleep. (crickets trilling) (low hissing) (smoke detector chirping) (fan blades swooshing) (distant lawn mower humming) (grunts) Good morning. Mm. Hey, man, did you hear that? The pool filter? Oh, my God. It was like a jet engine. I didn't get any sleep at all last night, you know? One noise is so much louder than all the city noises combined, you know? You just, you fixate. Totally. I get that, but I-I was actually talking about that chirping sound-- did you hear that? It was, like, happening all night. No, I didn't hear that. Oh, man, it was driving me nuts. Yeah. Anyway, want to roll? I, uh, got us some music. I made this Creed mix. Oh, uh, Creed, huh? Yeah, it's a long commute, so Yeah, I was thinking more, like, Bryan Adams. Okay. But it-it is Tuesday. Yeah Which is technically my music day. Right, it's Yeah, and that was cool and all when it only took us, like, ten minutes to get to work, but now we're looking at, like, an hour or so commute. I'm thinking maybe more my thing. But hey, you know what? Here's an idea. Why don't you take a personal day? You know, I mean, we got a lot of property here. It might be nice to have someone here to look after it. Yeah. You know, maybe get that TV working. Maybe take a run at that, uh, pool filter? Oh. Huh? MAN: Hey! You must be the new neighbors. Name's Wally Schmidt. No relation to Mike. But don't tell my wife. (chuckles) Boy, it sure is a hot one today, huh? Okay. Nice to meet you boys. What the hell was that all about? He just comes up and starts talking to us? Right, some guy comes up to me, I don't know what he's I don't know what he's up to. No. It's like the whole time, I'm staring at him, I'm thinking, does he have a knife? Are we gonna have to take this bitch out right now? No. I don't know. I don't know. But it's-it's the city, though. It-it's forced me to develop these sharp edges. For protection, you know? I got to smooth them out. We're in the suburbs. Let's work on it a little bit. Okay, all right. Shall we? You know, 'cause now I'm all tense. I don't want to bring this energy into work, you know? Luckily, I got the commute to relax.  Bought it at the five and dime  (horn honking) Aw, merge, merge! You had your Come on, you got, you have to seize the goddamn gap! People are so goddamn inefficient! Oh, goddamn it! I don't care if you're old! Seize the gap! You old fat bitch! You fat bitch! MAC: So, how was your day? DENNIS: Good. How was work? Any-any good stories? Charlie and Frank are doing something with Russian hats now. Really? What? I don't know. I couldn't follow any of it. What did you do today? Did you, uh, fix that pool filter? Uh I tried. But it turns out it's actually really complicated, and I didn't go to school for that, you know? Mostly I just tried to get the living room set up. It took a little while to find a stud. Yeah, I can, I can see that. Maybe, uh, take another personal day tomorrow, huh? You know, maybe I will take another run at that pool filter. Maybe try and do all the other things that you tried to do today, but, uh, you know do them. (low hissing) Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up! (chirping) Aw, damn it! What is that?  Played it till my fingers bled   Was the summer of '69  (car honks) What's your plan, huh? Two miles an hour. There you go. (horn honks) Oh, gun it. Use your signal, you cow!  Jimmy quit  Goddamn it.  Jody got married, I should've known  (muttering): Unbelievable. I don't see what the problem is. (tires screeching) Hey. Hey, hey! Slow down! Children play here, you fat cow! Hey, Wally. Oh, hey. (chuckles) Hot one today, huh? Yeah?! (door opens) Oh, that Wally loves to say "It's a hot one" when I already know it's a hot one. 'Cause I'm standing outside in the hot one. Thanks a lot, Wally. You know what? Tell me about future weather. Don't tell me about present weather Oh, I didn't realize we had company. Hey, Dennis. This is Jimmy-- he's the pool guy. I invited him over for dinner. Mac, can I speak to you in the foyer for a second? Oh, uh Sure. (chuckles) Excuse us for a second. Just be a just be a just be a quick minute here. Hey. What? DENNIS: Come on, man. You gonna invite some guy over to my house that I don't even know. MAC: I just wanted to have, uh, somebody over for dinner. DENNIS: So I got to have dinner with some guy, "Hey, pool guy." MAC: His name is Jimmy! DENNIS: Jimmy? I don't give a fuck what you do. MAC: You could ask him about all sorts of things. I mean DENNIS: What do you want me to ask pool guy? If he knew shit that I was interested in, he wouldn't be a fucking pool guy. I said I'm sorry. Yeah, yeah. No, I'm just, uh (chuckles) I'm just confused, you know, I Here I am thinking that we got a pool that's outside. Eh I didn't realize that we had an indoor pool. Can we just forget about it and eat our dinner? It's just so funny. We got enough money for two pools. And yet we don't have enough money for a recipe book, 'cause here we are eating mac and cheese again. You don't know how hard it is to be cooped up in here all by myself, okay? (laughs) At least you get to go to work. I "get to go to work"? Yes. Oh, everybody, hey, I get to go to work. I "get" to have a job. I "get" to have to make money for us. Oh, my You know what, screw this. Wh Oh, oh, yes. Fine, just walk away right in the middle Dennis. (thudding) Goddamn it. What is that? Aah. Son of a bitch. What? Son of a bitch. The hell you doing? Oh, do you hear it, too? I heard you bashing. Yeah, yeah, that chirping? I'm pretty sure it's a cricket. Okay, you know what, I'm gonna say something here, and it might not be popular, but I hate this place. And I got to get back to the city. I'm going nuts. I miss the city, too. I miss the action. You know, I thought this place would soften my edges, but they're sharper than ever. Dude, I cannot be cooped up here. You know, cooking and cleaning and fixing. All right, all right, calm down, calm down. I I think I have an idea. L-Let's let's invite the gang over. You know, we'll clean up the place, we'll serve 'em a nice dinner, we'll show 'em how-how well we're doing, and I'll feel Frank out about this bet, you know, which in retrospect is completely ridiculous. How are they gonna find an old man that's gonna go along with this? Right. Exactly. (chuckles) (doorbell rings) Mac and Dennis, old man. Old man, Mac and Dennis. DENNIS: Ah MAC: So, uh, what's with the hats? (Frank and Charlie laugh) I You wouldn't get it. Uh-uh. Yeah, you kind of had to be there, man. Hey, how about that food, huh? Mac calls it "Mac's famous mac and cheese." And it is famous. In my stomach. (laughs) We're your friends, and I've never heard of it. Hey, guys. We are having so much fun at this house. I'll tell you, I can't believe we ever lived anywhere else. But I was just curious, if we were to lose this bet, what would the logistics be, like, with the old man thing? FRANK: Oh. Well, I'll tell you what I'll do. If you guys are cracking, you can forfeit now, I'll buy the three of youse a California king-size bed
 to sleep in. DEE: What?! No, they're not gonna forfeit-- this place is rad. You want a little side action? No, no, no, don't muddy this with side action. Dee, don't do it. I'll take some side action. No (huffs) Tell you what. How about if they win, I'll take that California king bed for myself. Fine, and if they lose, the three of you got to sleep with the old man. (laughs) DEE: Fine. Deal. Goddamn it. Excuse me. I have to piss. Out of my penis. Right. Okay, well, clearly Mac wants to speak to me in secret. Uh, so excuse me. Wha? Oh, good, you got my signal. Yeah, got your signal. Dude, we're not gonna make it, we're not gonna make it. Yeah, dude, it's cool, man. W-We'll figure it out. It's No, no, it's not cool. There's no way we're gonna make it. And also, dude, what's with the hats? What is with those hats?! Dennis, I got to know. They told me the story, and it didn't make sense, and now we can't get it out of them. Look, dude, I don't want to sound racist, but can we just discuss the fact that it's an old black man? Yeah, mmm. It was supposed to be an old man. Just an old man. Now it's a black man. Dude, that's, like, a whole other thing. That's two things. That's two things, it's two things. All right, you know what, let's Maybe we just we-we just we take the California king. I mean, that's a big bed. You want to share the bed with an old black man? No, of course not, I All right, that sounded racist. I don't want to share a bed with an old man. I'm just saying it's a big bed, and we could probably work it out. Okay, so picture big bed, big bed. Me on the side, you know, you right here. Old man, right here. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Why am I in the middle? Black man should be in the middle. Don't call him "black man." His name's not "black man." His name's "old man." Let's stick with "old man." Okay. Just sounds better. All right, so how about this? You and I on the big bed, side-by-side, black man, he's Now you got me doing it. Mmm. Old man is down at the bottom, sideways, like a dog. Are you calling black people dogs? No, that's not what I That's very racist. What the hell is going? (gasps) Oh, my God. You guys are cracking, aren't you? (scoffs) Nah, it's-it's, like fine. Nah, it's fine. What?!
 It's soul-crushing, Dee.
 Oh, my God, I can't make this house into a home. I didn't go to school for that. He didn't go to school for it. No. Well, why did you let me take the side action?! I told you not to take the side action! You bitch. You bitch. Why didn't you yell it so I could hear it? I'm tired of yelling. Damn it. Now we got to figure out where Dee goes in the bed. DENNIS: Oh, right, Dee's got to be in the bed. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I'll tell you exactly where Dee goes, okay? Dee goes right in the goddamn middle of her brand-new California king-size bed all by herself. How are we even having this conversation?! All you boys have to do Guys, all you got to do to win is just exist. Hey, morning, buddy. You're up early. Yeah, I'm up early, and I'm feeling great. You know, I was thinking about it, and Dee was right. All we have to do is exist here for the next couple weeks, and we win this bet. So check this out. I made you that. "Mac's Honey Do List"? Yep. That is a list of chores to give you a sense of purpose, so you don't feel so cooped up and lonely. How's a list of chores going to make me feel less lonely? Well, check out chore number one. "Name the dog." Well, that's so stupid. I don't have a dog. You sure about that? Yeah, positive. I don't have a dog. I mean, I had Poppins, but he's gone. Are you sure? I don't have a dog. What do you mean, am I sure? Of course I'm sure. I wouldn't be so sure. What are you doing? Why What are you okay? Look behind you, asshole. Oh. (gasps) You got me a dog? Yeah. Oh, my God, he's so cute. I mean, he's no Poppins, but Yeah, he's a lot better than Poppins, trust me. Oh, Dennis, Dennis. I'm gonna name him Dennis. Huh? You're Dennis. He's Dennis Jr. Weird. Um, but sure, yeah, that's fine. Hey, so why don't you go ahead and cross number one off the list there? See how it feels. Okay, yeah. Hey, what's a-a couple weeks between two best friends, right? It's whatever we make of it. So why don't we agree right now to make these next few weeks the best of our lives? You with me, buddy? I'm with you. I'm gonna raise this guy like he was our own son. Okay. (laughing) Yeah. Weird.  I remember when   I remember, I remember when I lost my mind  No, don't merge, don't merge. We're all we'll all wait! We'll all wait for you to send your text! You fat pig! How you doing, neighbor? (whirring)  Does that make me crazy?  Shut up! (chirping)  Does that make me crazy?   Does that make me crazy? DENNIS: I'm not letting you in, pig! Gonna show up to work, have everybody be like, "Why is there blood all over you?" 'Cause I had to slit the guy's throat who causes all the traffic! Boy, it sure is a hot one, huh?  Who do you, who do you think you are?   Ha ha ha, bless your soul  (barking) (chirping loudly)  You really think  Shut up.  You're in control?  (whirring) (laughing): I can't believe it.  Well, I think you're crazy  Goddamn it! Damn it I hate the fucking suburbs!  I think you're crazy   I think you're crazy  WALLY: Hey, buddy. Haven't seen you for a bit. You've probably been staying inside to avoid this, uh, heat wave, huh? Boy, it's been hot. It's hot, huh? Yeah. It is super hot. Yeah. It's getting real hot around here. So hot, Wally. But you don't really know what hot is, do you? Hot's a storm. You ever been in a storm, Wally? I mean, a real storm? Not a thunderstorm, but a storm of fists raining down on your head. Blasting you in the face. Pummeling you in the stomach. Hitting you in the chest so hard you think your heart's gonna stop. You ever been in a storm like that, Wally? (screaming) MAC: Dennis. Dennis. You okay, dude? Yeah. Who you talking to? No one. What's that? Dog grave. Oh. Anything exciting happen at work today? Uh-uh. Well, I called up there. They they said you weren't even there. Can we not talk about my day? Sure. Perhaps we can talk about my day. And how was your day? Not great. You know, with the dog dying and all, but somehow, old Mac pulled it together. He cooked for you, and he cleaned for you. In fact, Dennis, everything I do, I do for you. What are you talking about, man? I'm talking about everything I do, I do for you! And everything you do, you do for yourself! Sleeping in your car. Eating at Applebee's. Were you spying on me? Oh, don't you turn this around on me. All you do is think about yourself! You didn't even notice that I switched up the mac and cheese. Is that what this is about? The goddamn mac and cheese? Well, yeah, I noticed! You put meat hunks in it! Wow! Hunks of meat! Mmm! Well, of course Dennis would like Dennis. What? It's Dennis! What are you talking about? You're eating the dog! (laughing wildly) Oh! Oh! Oh, God! What is wrong with you? I don't know! I guess it was just a cry for attention. You didn't even blink twice when I told you that the dog was dead. I can't live with you anymore in this goddamn place. I'm out of here. I'm gonna go stay in a hotel. Where's my suitcase, Mac? Wait. Wait, wait. Wait, wait. Dennis, Dennis, Dennis, Dennis, Dennis Tell me about Mac's famous mac and cheese. Okay, I can explain. I called it my famous mac and cheese as-as a joke. But then it seemed like you like it. You like that it was Mac's famous mac and cheese. And so I just kept saying it. You're pathetic. You're the one that's sitting at Applebee's eating pot stickers all by yourself. You're the one that's pathetic. (doorbell rings) Oh. Well, that must be nosy Wally. Coming to see what all the fighting's about. Well why don't we show him what all the fighting's about? Why don't we show him right now? Wait, wait, wait! Dennis, Dennis, calm down. Don't you tell me to calm down. (smoke alarm chirps) There's that chirping again. How are you not hearing that? News flash, asshole! I've been hearing it the entire goddamn time! Then why wouldn't you say something?! Because I hate you! Oh, my God. (whooping) You did it! Look at this! Huh? We did what? You got this, man. Hey, in less than a minute, Almost there. you guys will have been here a month. Yep. We almost we almost won the bet? Yeah. We almost did it! W-W-We almost won the bet? We're gonna do it!

If everybody sticks to the tasks that I've carefully tailored  for each of you, then you're gonna be great. 
 Everything's gonna work out.
  Oh, shit!  Frank, do you know what's happening?  Mm, play it cool, play it cool.  Ah, Dennis, I know what's happening. 
 Ah!
 My God.
So what?  Well, if we were just asking if everybody knows what's going on,  I just want to say that I do. I wasn't asking.  We're not. He didn't. That's not what's going on.  He didn't ask that. That's not the thing.  I wasn't. All right, you know what?  Let's just let's go over the blueprint, okay?  Yeah, the blueprint. I want everybody to map out their positions.

If it weren't for that choking fit,  we would have never been able to run tests, and  We found something. You have a very serious disease,  but fortunately, we caught it just in time  There's a malignant tumor on your front lobe  Oh, look at those Winnebagos.  Shaboya roll call!  I would like to take a ride down the Grand Canyon  in those honeys.  Which sadly means, we might have to remove it. 
 Huh?

Wait, please, sir, whatever you do, don't  Frank, Frank, come in. Over.  I'm on my way.  Aw, shit. I need a ride.  I'll bet Pondy will pick me up.  Party mobile's here!  Thanks for the ride, Pondy!  Hop in, Frank.  Aw, goddamn it, Pondy's the coolest.  It's official, Frank. I divorced that cheatin' bitch.  Yeah. I mean, I cheated on her, too.  But who's keeping score, right?  Anywho, I got a nest egg to blow so that whore can't touch it.  Let's rage!  Hey. Here. Take an aspirin.  That ain't aspirin.  It ain't aspirin.  Does Frankenstein want to come out and play?  I'm sorry, Pondy. No drugs for me today.  I need to keep my wits about me. Lame!

Let's review the plan. Okay, listen.  Pay attention. So, Frank,  you're on guard dog duty.  Dee, Charlie, and I are gonna distract the guard.  Mac is tossing the rug over the barbed wire and sneaking in.  Yeah? I'm still lost.  Uh, one problem. We're gonna need 
 a new rug because I threw it clean over.
 What? 
 Oh. Goddamn it!
 Oh, Jesus, dude!  How'd this happen? All you had to do was drape it on the barbed wire  and-and climb over the fence. I'm too strong.  I'm sorry, Dennis. "Too strong." Okay, well, you know what,  don't apologize to me. Apologize to everybody else  that you let down. All right, we don't have time for apologies.  What's Plan B here? Does anyone know?  There is no goddamn Plan B. I don't know.  All right, Mac, you got to find some other way over that fence.  We'll go we'll go distract the guard. I-I Yeah, yeah.

I just want him to think that I'm cool, you know?  And I just feel like Is this a little bit lame?  I just feel like I can talk to you about this kind of stuff.  Yeah? Oh, yeah, you can tell me anything.  Really? Oh, well,  honestly, I just feel like  Oh, God, this one creeps me out.  I hate being alone with him.  If he touches me, I swear to God I'm gonna freak out.  you know what I mean? Yeah, yeah. Totally, totally.  Yeah, okay.

Oh, what a day.  Yeah, it sure was, Charlie. I'll tell you, though.  Great work, bud. You killed it, really.  Ah, thanks, Charlie.  When you got a good plan, you stick to it. 
 Piece of cake.
 Yeah.  All right, well I guess we should go to sleep.  We've got a big day tomorrow. We do?  Yeah! With  You're just messing with me, aren't you?  Oh, you know exactly what we're doing tomorrow, don't you?  Of course I do.  We got the thing with the thing. Uh, the thing.  We yeah, we probably should go to sleep.  Yeah. All right, well. Hmm.  Could go to sleep, or, uh  we could play one quick game of night crawlers.  Oh. Aah! You down for that?  I knew you would be.  All right, let me get the blanket, let me get the blanket.  Okay.  Darkness falls.  And magic stirs.  As we become the creatures of the night                          BILL: You really think Jack can handle this case?  CHARLIE: Yeah, he's a lawyer.  FRANK: Besides, Bill, you're broke.  He's the best lawyer you can afford.  Yeah, Bill, you got to relax, okay? Uncle Jack  and I-- we got this case. Now-now, listen to me.  Liam McPoyle's gonna come at you hard, all right?  But-but I've done my research. I got something with this  bird theory, it's gonna blow the court away. I-I  I don't I don't think we should pursue  this bird nonsense, Charlie. Yes.  I-I'm well-versed in bird law. Look,  Pondy, keep your eye on the prize.  This goes well, it's party time.  What is that?  Is that is that drugs, Frank? Yeah.  No, dude, I need you keeping him clean,  all right? That's why you're here.  I got to have the drugs here  to keep him clean.  Well, that doesn't make sense.  I Get rid of the drugs, Frank.  I-I don't want that. Hey, boys.  You ready for the big show? Yes, good, how you feeling?  You good, you do your homework, you know your talking points? Yeah.  Yeah, I'm good. Yeah, cool as a cucumber.  You can you can get off my back. Well, don't sass me,  I just It was just a general Well, then don't hound me.  question, Dee. I'm just saying if you don't want sass,  then you should probably stop being a hound. All right, whatever.  Mac, why are you here?  This is your big day, dude. McPoyle suing Ponderosa?  It's huge, it's like the trial of the century.  Come on, man, everybody's got a thing. Don't leave me out.  Frank's got a thing, Dee's got a thing. Dennis has got a thing.  Dennis has a thing-- what are you talking about?  Oh! D What are you doing here?  There's got to be a way to get this court  to let me out of my alimony payments.  I mean, you guys seen Maureen? The woman has gone  almost full cat. It's-it's madness.  I shouldn't have to pay for that,  so I'm gonna talk to the judge, get him to throw it  on the docket, you know what I mean?  No, absolutely not.  That's gonna distract from my case.  Buddy, you don't have a case, okay?  You are not a lawyer.  Uncle Jack's just got you here handling  his papers for him 'cause he can't do it  'cause he's wearing those goddamn  big hands over his hands.  I don't know what that is. What is that? I don't know what it is.  All right, well, either way, this whole thing's gonna be  a goddamn fiasco, and I'm gonna enjoy every second of it.  No, it's gonna go fine. No, it isn't.  No, it's gonna be fine. This is hardly the trial  of the century. Everything's gonna go just great.   On a scale of one to ten, how much sass  are you gonna give me today? A-Are you serious?  And hello to you all.  What's the Jew lawyer doing here?  Not Jewish, and even if I was,  what difference would it make?  I meant that as a compliment.  Everybody knows Jews are the best lawyers.  I can't wait to crush you people.  I'll be representing Liam McPoyle today.  Where is Liam? Well, he actually got pinkeye  in his one good eye.  Well, in truth, someone named Doc McPoyle  attempted to put some sort of healing milk in his pinkeye  and it got infected, but that doesn't matter.  The point is  you'll be dealing with me today.  And you'll be dealing with me today.  Jack Kelly, lawyer.  Good to see you again.  Are those fake hands?  No. Are those fake hands?  You know what, good luck with all of that today.  (sighs)  Did you see his hands? They're beautiful.  I think we should settle. What Jesus Christ.  I'm going to prison. It's gonna be fine.  67th District Court is now in session.  Judge Clarence Melvoy presiding.  Please remove your hats and turn off your cell phones.  Okay. We have McPoyle v. Ponderosa.  Seeking damages for the loss of an eye in the form  of a one-time payment to the sum of  $200.  Are the plaintiffs present?  I will be representing  the plaintiffs, Your Honor.  The defendants? Uh, yes, Your Honor.  And I just, uh, wanted to say I'm very excited  to be here. I do estate law,  and this is my first actual trial.  Uh, Your Honor, and if I may, uh, Charlie Kelly, cocounsel.  Uh, background in bird law, uh  Nephew. Yeah. But excited to be, uh, in the people's court  a-and a big fan of black judges,  too. Stop touching me.  Okay. Look.  All I need are the facts to this case.  I have a very long day ahead of me,  so I'm gonna need to keep this thing moving.  Are you gonna bang the, uh Yeah, yeah.  the-the hammer? Do we Is there a  Okay, we good?  Hey. (chuckles) Okay. Cool.  Awesome. Yeah.  It's cool, right? Yeah, nice.  LAWYER: Your Honor,  Friday the 13th was a night of chaos.  Milk,  spiked with bath salts by this man,  Bill Ponderosa,  was served to the wedding guests.  Now, my client is odd.  You might even refer to his family as  very creepy.  But they are saints compared  to Bill Ponderosa  and the sordid lot of degenerates  he associates with.  Terrible people who ruin lives.  Ruined mine, cost my client his marriage,  ruined my first, now my second one is teetering.  You know what  I'm gonna sit down.  I'm done.  They just do this to me, okay?  You get the point.  UNCLE JACK: Uh, Your Honor, I'll-I'll, uh,  I'll keep it brief.  I just have three things to say.  Uh, one:  Liam McPoyle has a history of lying.  Two: My client is a loving  family man.  And three:  He is innocent.  Deandra Reynolds,  you were the one that told the police that Bill had  spiked the punch with bath salts. That's correct.  But you didn't actually see him do it, did you?  No, I did not. So is it possible that,  given the traumatic nature of the evening,  that you don't remember the evening  all that well? Yes, that's correct.  My car was destroyed and I was locked into a freezer.  My memory was clouded by rage,  and so I misremembered the incident.  An understandable mistake. Could happen to any one of us.  For example, you remember me, possibly,  as a man with small hands.  Yeah, you think  What you think, "He had small hands."  Do you remember that?  Yeah, sure, okay.  What you remember is false.  O-Okay. Yup.  Big, masculine.  My hands tell a story  of greatness. 
 And when you look at my right hand MELVOY: I'm gonna st  uh, uh, I'm gonna stop you  right now. Are you just gonna  talk about your hands for a while?  Uh, no, Your Honor.  No more questions for the witness.  (sighs) Deandra,  here is the statement that you gave  to police.  "Bill did it. That goddamn drug addict  "is out of his mind. I'll testify to that.  "I swear on my mother's grave that Bill spiked  "that milk, no doubt about it.  He's guilty, guilty, guilty."  DEE: Uh  Have you ever had sex  with Bill before?  Yeah.  Yes, sure. Because we-we were  We had a We were sort of  We were lovers for a little  One of his prostitutes, right.  Prostitutes?  Um, I have a receipt for a mink coat,  recently purchased by a Bill Ponderosa  to be delivered to a Dee Reynolds.  A gift?  Yes. I had a birthday.  Six months ago.  Uh Are you aware  that the coat was purchased  at Doyle McPoyle's Trappings and Fur?  No. Or that the coat  was not made of mink at all  but rather made of muskrat?  Muskrat? Goddamn muskrat? Are you kidding me,  Bill? Okay, you know what, fine, he spiked it.  (murmuring) I'm sorry. What did you say?  He spiked it, and then he tried to bribe me.  (groaning)  No further questions, Your Honor.  Ma'am, do you know what perjury is?  Mm-hmm.  CHARLIE: Oh, this is terrible.  Well, he shouldn't be This is terrible.  Wow, you guys are getting crushed in there.  Yeah. Oh, I know. Hey, thanks, Mac. Hi. Great.  Hey, you know, I feel like I'm not being utilized properly.  Well, that's 'cause you don't have anything.  So you're not being utilized at all.  Yeah, but what if I get to deliver the bombshell?  Oh. What bombshell?  You guys don't have a bombshell? Oh, my God.  Every good case needs a bombshell.  Oh, Jesus Christ, and, without it,  you're screwed. You know what, you know what? Okay.  I'll find one for you. I'm gonna do, like, a hero cop,  Mark Fuhrman thing Oh, Mark Furhman. No  and then sort of transition into a Kato Kaelin.  Yeah, I wish you would do none of it.  Okay. All right. Cool. I wish you'd do none of it, man.  I'm on it, I'm on it. Okay. All right.  Ah, why can't people just stay out of this?  Yeah, look, there's potentially That-That's my bird expert.  He's from Penn. The guy Like, he's totally official, okay?  Let me do the bird thing. He's an ornithologist. I don't think it's a good  I'm gonna kill, man. I know, but, Charlie, I'm just  Uncle Jack, put me back on the stand. What?  No, we cannot. Are you kidding me?  You're lucky you didn't get sent to jail.  Yeah, I know. But I think this could work.  I'm gonna say I found some bullshit online  that proves that lawyer's Jewish. Oh.  So what? So what? He'll be a laughingstock.  (laughs) Yes. Yes. Right?  Because the man is Jewish?  No. What? No. Not because he's Well, that's what  it sounds like you're saying. N-Not because he's Jewish. Because he's a liar  and because he's embarrassed about being Jewish.  I mean, what is that?  Dee, you blew it. Like, big-time.  I wish you guys would just stay out of this.  I-I didn't I-I (groans)  Maureen, you are the sister of Bill Ponderosa,  and it was at your wedding that Liam got attacked?  Meow. Mmm.  Your Honor, nothing represents the tragic aftermath  more than the dramatic transformation of this woman  Uh, cat. Excuse me?  As I transition from woman to cat,  I must insist on being referred to as a cat.  Objection. She's not a cat, Your Honor.  (hisses) (gallery gasping)  If the witness wants to consider herself a cat, I will allow it.  I just need to know where all this is headed.  How is this relevant?  Well, it's clearly relevant  the attack had a psychological impact  on all the parties that evening.  No further questions.  Y-Your Honor, do you see what's going on here? This is crazy.  You know what, I'm gonna I'm gonna approach the bench. No.  Can I just approach it real fast? Absolutely not.  All right, earlier, you-you referred to my ex-wife as a cat,  per her request. Uh, now, surely, you wouldn't force a man  to pay alimony to a cat, right?  So motion to establish me not having to pay alimony anymore.  I will not allow that. Okay, well, so can we just we'll pop it on the docket?  We can put it at the end of the day if you want.  I just want to clear it up while I got her in a courtroom.  I will not allow that, either. Sit down.  Now you don't allow something. Now you don't allow something!  Allow all this. You gonna allow that?  You know? But you don't Okay, I'm good. Goddamn it.  UNCLE JACK: Frank,  did you go to the wedding? I did.  And I snuck Ryan up in the trunk of my car.  He hadn't been invited to the wedding, on account of the beef with Liam.  And I had him in the trunk of the car, on account of I didn't want to sit with him  'cause he's gross. Right.  (chuckles) And, uh, uh,  what did Ryan say to you when you got to the wedding?  "I'm gonna kill Maureen Ponderosa."  So, if there's someone to point the finger at, it would be  his brother! (gallery gasping)  Oh, my God! Oh, my God, nobody look!  Nobody look! Nobody look!  Nobody look! Nobody look!  Nobody look!  Now, you've stabbed  your brother before, correct?  Oh, sure.  And you were upset at the wedding.  So it's not crazy for me to ask you this.  Ryan McPoyle, did you attack your brother at the wedding?  Oh. I'm not Ryan.  What? You're not? No.  I'm Lion. Like the animal.  Lion McPoyle.  Wh-Why are you on the stand?  Because you said "his brother"  and threw your big fake hand at me.  O-Okay. Ryan's at home with Liam, taking care of his infected eye.  Okay, uh, uh, boy, let's, uh,  str-strike that, uh, hand comment from the record.  Uh, would you happen to know  if Ryan stabbed his brother in the eye?  Oh, yeah. I know. He totally did it.  (gallery murmuring) Well, then I guess  we will never know, ladies and gentlemen.  Uncle Jack, he just confessed!  He did? Yes!  Yeah, Ryan stabbed Liam. I totally saw it.  Oh, my God! We won!  (light cheering and applause)  We did it! We did it. How did I do it?  Lion, was Ryan drinking milk at the wedding?  Of course. Everyone was.  So who did the stabbing doesn't matter, Your Honor,  because they were all still drugged  on Bill Ponderosa's spiked milk,  which is the point I've been trying to make the entire time.  So just to be clear, you've proven my case.  You lose.  (gallery groaning) (sighs) I can't follow any of this.  What? Guys, guys, I got it.  You-you got what?  I got the bombshell.  UNCLE JACK: Okay, Mr. McDonald,  you recently found out some very interesting information.  Care to share it with the court?  Yes. I've recently been informed  that Ryan McPoyle only drinks mother's milk!  (gallery gasping, murmuring) Which means there's no way  he could have drank the milk that Bill spiked,  which means he was sober when he attacked his brother,  which means Bill is innocent!  Case closed! Kaboom!  Bombshell!  (laughs)  I did it. I did it, black judge. I did it.  Mr Mr. McDonald, how did you come upon this information?  Oh, I banged Margaret McPoyle. I'm curious  how she told you, because Margaret is a mute.  Well, guess what, smart guy, I had her write it down.  One more thing, Your Honor. Margaret, you carry a picture  of Mother with you at all times, don't you?  Do you mind showing that to the court?  (gallery gasping)  LAWYER: Your Honor,  "Mother" is the name of the McPoyle family cow.  The cow that provided the milk for the wedding.  The milk that was drugged by  Bill Ponderosa.  That mute bitch lied to me for sex.  Bombshell diffused.  Abramowitz! (gallery murmuring)  Your great-grandmother's last name was Abramowitz.  I found it on an ancestry Web site.  That makes you a dirty liar because you are Jewish.  (gallery groaning and murmuring)  Okay, I That came out kind of bad.  I-I'm not disgusted by the Jewish part.  It's the it's the lying part that I was talking about.  This dirty liar is a Jew  ish man.  Recess?  CHARLIE: Oh, God!  Oh, that stupid Dee. All right, calm down, calm down.  Look, as the great Johnnie Cochran once said,  if the glove doesn't fit, give up.  That's not what he said! That's not It  How are you a lawyer, Jack? I  I mean, I know more than you. All right, look  Watch your voice. Watch your voice. Okay, okay, let's just  let me do my bird thing. Okay, Bill,  I want to do the bird thing. Can we just do it?  Yeah, that's great. No, let's do the bird thing.  You're good with it now? Okay. Love it, yeah.  Jesus, son, what'd you cut this with? Shut up, bitch.  Son? Your This is Your son is your dealer?  He's reliable.  Oh, God. Frank, what are you doing, man?  Come on, reign it in. I paid for it.  I'm gonna do it. Hey, fat ass, this asshole's short 30 bucks.  Go steal another set of my golf clubs, you piece of shit.  (bleep) you. Forget it. Piss off.  Guys, guys, we're doing the bird theory, all right? All right.  All right. All right. All right. I'm taking the lead here, okay?  Yeah. All right, let's do it. Birds on three.  ALL: One, two, three. Birds! Those are just ridiculous.  It's like three hands like eight hands out there. Yeah.  CHARLIE: Your Honor,  this is the McPoyle family crest.  On it you will find a bird--  a Pocono swallow, to be more accurate.  A very rare, very elusive bird.  You'll notice its trademark  unibrow, highly uncommon in most aviary circles.  And my research shows  that unlike your typical North American barn swallow,  the Pocono swallow, if kept under the proper conditions,  can live as long as 80 to even 85 years,  much like a parrot  or some of the more resilient coastal gulls.  Your Honor, where is this going?  I don't know, but it better lead somewhere fast.  Your Honor, I can assure you  that this will be our final argument.  Well, if it's gonna help end all of this madness,  I'll allow it.  Thank you, Your Honor.  Now, there was another member  of the McPoyle family clan at the wedding  the night of the incident.  A member that none of us have met.  Certainly not anyone on this side of the aisle.  A one Mr. Royal McPoyle.  A bird. The McPoyle family's  pet Pocono swallow, and my research shows  that this particular Pocono swallow  has a history of violence.  Look into the gallery, and you will see Royal's victims.  It took Margaret's vocal cords in 1999,  leaving her mute.  Keith McPoyle lost his eyes and his ears  to it in '76, and we all know  that according to bird law, it's three strikes,  and you're out.  Bye, bye, birdie.  Ready, boys and girls, because here's where it gets good.  Ryan McPoyle didn't attack Liam. Royal did.  And Lion was lying about Ryan attacking Liam  to protect Royal from the chair.  Or lethal injection.  Or perhaps some sort of small bird guillotine.  I wouldn't understand the physics of it.  I'm not an executioner.  I'm just the best goddamn bird lawyer in the world.  So, bottom line-- and listen up, numbnuts,  'cause it blows a hole in your case--  birds don't drink milk.  Objection, Your Honor. (gallery groaning)  There's no Royal McPoyle.  Perhaps, or perhaps not.  Your Honor, I call Pappy McPoyle to the stand.  Pappy McPoyle, patriarch of the McPoyle family.  Royal was your pet bird. You've had him since you were a boy.  And isn't it true that you never go anywhere without him?  (crying): Yeah. Yeah.  I have seen  raccoons and oysters dancing  in the head of a pin with the angels.  They are laughing.  LAWYER: All right, Your Honor,  clearly, this witness is mentally unwell  and cannot answer any of the questions properly  Uh, perhaps, Your Honor, or-or perhaps it's just a cover.  But it's quite all right.  I don't have any further questions.  Oh, except one more.  Didn't the bailiff ask everyone to remove their hats?  That is true.  Mr. McPoyle,  would you please remove your hat?  Mmm Mr. McPoyle, please remove your hat.  Perhaps he is too insane to understand the question.  Why don't I just?  (squawk)  (gallery groans, gasps, shouts)  Ladies and gentlemen, Royal McPoyle.  (squawks)  Chickadee, dee, dee, little birdy.  Let's dance.  Your Honor, this is Mr. Belka Meir.  He's a professor of ornithology at the University of Penn.  Mr. Meir, it's safe to say  you're a bit of an expert on birds, yes?  I believe you're correct, yes.  And you would understand this Pocono swallow quite well,  wouldn't you? Yes, I do.  Then please ask it if it attacked Liam!  Ask if What?  CHARLIE: Mr. Meir, I would like you to please talk  to the bird and say, "Did you attack Liam McPoyle?!"  (laughing): I can't converse with with a bird.  Well, I thought you were an expert on birds. I am an expert on birds, but  Well, I need you to communicate with the bird. 
 This is very important, and I need to MEIR: But it's a  (laughs)  Well, this is a bit embarrassing, Your Honor.  Perhaps this man has lied about his credentials.  Uh, fortunately, I am familiar with a little bit of pigeon.  Perhaps I can get through to it in some way.  (cooing)  LAWYER: Okay.  Your Honor, this is nonsense.  Here, kitty. (mews)  Here, kitty. Chase the laser beam, kitty. (gallery gasping and murmuring)  Order. Your Honor, you've got a man speaking to a bird.  And yet, you refuse to rule  on me having to pay alimony to this cat.  What is this?! Order!  It's a mockery of justice, Your Honor.  This is ridiculous, and this  I said, order! (gallery clamoring)  LAWYER: He's talking to the pigeon!  I'm not paying alimony to a goddamn cat!  Order! I want order in this court!  Fly, my pet!  Fly!  (bird squawking, people screaming)  Bring me their eyes!  (laughing)  (screaming, shouting)  Bring them to me!  (laughing)  Oh!  (clamoring)  (screaming)  MELVOY: In my 35 years on this bench,  I have never seen such a mockery made of this courtroom.  You people have wasted my time,  you've wasted the taxpayers' time,  and this justice has heard enough.  I am throwing this case out.  I should've done it hours ago.  He's throwing it out! That means we win!  That means we win! That means we won!  Damn, damn, damn!  Son of a bitch! Order.  Damn! Damn it! (shouting)  Order!  This court has ruled.  Now, I suggest  that you people get the hell out of my courtroom  before I put you all in jail.  You got it! Get out!  Bailiff, next case.  It's ridiculous.  We have Morgan State Delivery  v. the proprietors of one Paddy's Pub.  Oh! That's us. That's us, Your Honor. Oh, that's us.  Oh, hell no! Uh-uh. Uh-uh! All right!                          1 DENNIS: Okay, gather round, everybody, gather round.  Gather round, please.  I have a, uh, a presentation.  Now, because of everyone's A.D.D., I know I'm gonna  lose your attention in about three minutes,  and, uh, Frank's gonna fall asleep. FRANK: No way.  I slept 26 hours last night.  You still seem very sleepy. Can I start my presentation?  Where's the easel? No, no, I'm not using an easel-- don't interrupt.  You want me to go get the projector? No, I don't want the projector.  And I don't want the easel. What are you gonna point with?  Don't want whatever the hell you're gonna say.  'Cause it's all gonna be old and outdated, all right?  Let me start my presentation, which is actually about that.  It's about innovation.  Not taking questions. Goddamn.  Let me do my thing, okay? Stop interrupting.  Okay, so, um, as we all know, um, tomorrow is St. Paddy's Day,  traditionally our most profitable day.  However, recently, profits have been declining.  Every year. And we need to change.  We need innovation.  We need to move Paddy's from the past and into  the future, a mobile Paddy wagon.  Now, these days, people like to have things on demand.  So instead of having to go to a bar,  we will bring the bar to you.  Ooh, is that, like, a car service type of thing?  Where we pick people up and take 'em around from bar to bar  and jack up the prices?  That's actually a really good idea. Uh, no.  The Paddy's wagon is the bar.  MAC: No, Dennis.  If we want to make money,  we need to honor ancient Irish traditions,  like serving an irresponsible amount of booze to people  who are genetically predisposed to having alcohol problems.  CHARLIE: Right. MAC: You see,  St. Patrick started that tradition,  and that's why we celebrate him today.  Yeah No, that's not what he did.  No, he-he played the flute for some kids,  and then he lured them into a cave somewhere,  and he diddled them. FRANK: Nah.  You got him mixed up with the Pied Piper. Right.  FRANK: St. Patrick didn't play the flute.  He drove the kids out of Ireland.  And then he molested 'em.  No, no, if-if St. Patrick molested kids,  he would be regarded as a scoundrel. No, no, no.  I feel like, in the olden days of the Catholic Church,  pedophiles were regarded as heroes.  All right, all right, look, g-guys, uh,  St. Patrick didn't do any of that shit, okay?  He drove the snakes out of Ireland.  Uh, I-I don't know about all this.  I kind of want to just do the traditional thing  of, like, sticking around the bar  and-and trying to catch the leprechaun. No, no!  No, we don't want to do a leprechaun thing again.  Stop, stop, guys I'm gonna catch one.  I'm, like, this close. You're not gonna catch him  because he doesn't exist. Guys, please  You know what I don't even know  if I've set up my glue traps for him yet.  Charlie, enough with the leprechaun!  I mean, can you believe him? Okay, wait.  Who cares? Look, I'm trying to You know what,  actually-- I might want to get myself a flute.  I was thinking the same thing. We've been talking you were?  Yeah, because I-I feel like it's a really fun  DEE: I know we're kind of old, but Go get a flute?  Go get a flute, yeah. Go get go get a flute!  Everybody go get a flute!  DEE: in the sixth grade, I feel like it's kind of simple.  (sighs heavily) Frank, look  All right, let me explain it to you, at least.  (snoring) No, he's gone.  Okay.   So, Frank, here's the plan.  We're gonna fill the wagon with hip, attractive clientele.  We're gonna use my streamlined system to process drink orders.  We're gonna take photographs with a retro filter  for the Web site.  And that will entice future end users  to comment and spread brand awareness  over various social media platforms.  That seems insanely complicated.  Why don't we just take cash?  No, no, no, no. What I'm talking about's way simpler than cash.  It's-it's streamlined.  I'm lost. It's I'm trying to explain it to you  and I feel like you're not even listening. I-I  (Irish accent): Top o' the morning, you filthy lads.  I'm fixing to have a whale of a time in this here mobile pub.  I'm so sorry-- what is this?  Crazy Paddy, you big, dumb arse.  (laughs) Yeah. Why?  'Cause it's fun. No.  I thought that's the thing about St. Patrick's Day--  people want clownery and-and they want to embrace  the Irish stereotypes. No, no, no. This isn't innovative.  It's outdated and it's gonna offend people.  Well, I brought my piece in case anybody gets out of line. Oh, I  Okay, Frank, Frank, look-- no guns.  Let go. No guns, no costumes.  Trust me, I got this.  Frank, you're gonna drive. Drive.  Okay, Dee, you're gonna serve drinks. In the back.  As a human being. A real one.  Mm. Guys,  I'm gonna provide  the experience.  (Irish jig plays) BOTH: Ooh.  Okay, yeah. Yeah, right?  Yeah, I like this. Nice.  I See, I told you. I know what I'm doing.  Come on, let's go.  Frank, you're driving.  Okay. Here we go. (engine starts)  Ho! Check it out, Mac-- got some cool stuff.  I got some green paint and I found a snake.  Great. Why?  You know, the snakes, 'cause, like, we I don't remember  where we landed on St. Paddy, but I remember snakes  were involved. And the green paint's for the, uh, beer.  Okay, love the snake. Great catch there.  But why not just use food coloring for the beer?  Uh, 'cause beer's not a food.  When was the last time you ate a beer?  When was the last time you drank paint?  Have you been drinking paint?  No.  Let me see your tongue.  Oh, my God, dude!  Oh, that shit's just disgusting! It's not bad.  You you can't drink paint. I know. I hear you, I hear you.  You say that, but I don't think that you're gonna stop.  Yeah, I get it, though, man. It's, uh Right.  I-I feel like you're saying you get it, but you don't get it.  It's cool. It's not cool.  It is what it is. Oh, my God,  this is so frustrating! Look,  I'm gonna go down to the basement  and I'm gonna check out my glue traps  and see if I, you know, got a leprechaun in there. Wait, no, no, no, no.  What We said no leprechaun this year.  You're not chasing leprechauns.  I know, and I kind of forgot where we landed on that.  I got these great cookie sheets, they're filled with glue, so  But I-I hear you, I hear you.  It's a frustrating thing. It's like the guy doesn't  listen to us, man, when we're trying to get through to him.  It's a bummer.  No, not you. Keep moving, let's go,  come on. You kidding me?  Oh, oh, h-hey-hey, there, fellas.  What's going on? Where you going? You know what?  Don't answer that. Because I already know.  You're going for a ride in the Paddy's Wagon.  Oh, cool. Is this, like, a car service thing?  Hey, can you take us to Center City?  No, it's not a goddamn car service. Why does everyone  (Irish accent): You get in that wagon right now or I'm gonna  sock you a good one right in the kisser!  (forced laugh) Yeah, you dumb bi  What the hell are you doing? Uh, just innovating.  I took the Paddy's wig and I cut it  into an awesome beard. Great new character. No.  Hilarious. You've just created another  offensive Irish stereotype, Dee.  The Fighting Irish-- I-it's true.  I mean, that's what Irish people do. That is not what  They get drunk, they fight people.  All right, I'm trying to give these guys Look, guys,  don't pay attention to her.  I-I want to give you an authentic, um, uh,  once-in-a-lifetime experience here.  Oh. Oh, wait, so is this, like, a bang bus?  No, no, no, no, no. It's not a bang bus, okay?  Look Just get in the wagon,  I'll give you a ride to Center City.  Get in.  DENNIS: Gentlemen,  let me walk you through how our simple business works.  God, take it easy, Frank!  Don't tell me how to drive, you bitch.  Let Let's keep it light for the customers, all right, Frank?  As I was saying, fellas, uh, what you're gonna  need to do is you, uh, you're gonna  take a picture of this QR code,  you're gonna download the app,  log in using Facebook, and you're gonna watch  a-a brief, 30-second advertisement.  And then once we receive your online order,  you will promptly be served a beer.  Can't I just pay you cash? That's what I Yeah.  Well, no, cash is the way  that antiquated companies do business.  Yeah, I just want a beer. I don't really  want you to have all my personal information.  A beer. Just want a beer.  Don't want you to have my  (Dee and Dennis laugh) Yeah.  Look, man, um, if I just gave you a beer,  and you just gave me cash,  then you wouldn't be able to experience  everything that we've got to offer here, okay?  Look, I'll show you. This Let me just pull up my  I got a little presentation here that I put together.  But, uh, can't get the goddamn thing to to go online.  I don't have a signal here. Goddamn it. You know what?  Dee, uh, why don't you just give him a couple free beers?  We'll-we'll call 'em "freemiums."  Don't know if you're familiar with that term.  This is like all foam. Dee, you goddamn bitch!  Hey! Oh, this thing's bouncing around  like a pinball. Don't blame me.  FRANK: Keep it light, you bitch!  All right. Yeah, this is weird to me.  Can we just get out here?  Hey, it's locked. Can you guys let us out?  No, I'm not gonna let you out. Screw this. I'm calling the cops.  Why would you call the cops? We're just hanging out, man!  All right, stop, stop, stop.  All right, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Push "end." End.  (phone chimes) Give the phones to the girl.  Let's go, guys. I don't want to have to do this shit.  Frank, we got to pivot the business.  FRANK: Mm-hmm.  Come on, get the hell out. Everybody out.  Out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out.  All right. (clears throat)  Don't worry. We're gonna mail your phones back to you, but  we're gonna need your addresses, so fork over your I.D.'s.  Let's go. Come on. And their money.  We can't have 'em cabbing it back to the city  and going straight to the cops.  (scoffs) Goddamn it. That's a good point.  Okay, you know what? Dee, collect their wallets.  Don't worry, guys. We're not thieves.  You'll get your wallets back, too.  Yeah. Don't be babies. All right, uh,  come on, come on, guys, let's go, let's go.  Let's go. Shut the doors.  Did we just kidnap and rob those guys?  We just drove the snakes out of Philly,  the way St. Patrick did.  Oh!  So, what you're saying is,  technically, we gave those guys  a very authentic St. Patty's Day experience.  Oh. Yeah.  Nice. In a way.  Oh. All right.  That's good. That's good. Yeah.  Okay, okay, okay, okay. Here.  Jesus Christ, where's Charlie?  Hey, Mac, somebody stole my damn wallet. What?!  Beat it! Beat it, Mauricio! I need to talk to Mac.  Charlie, where have you been, dude?  I can't run the bar by myself and do security.  People are getting their wallets stolen.  Okay, uh, look, just come  to the basement with me, like, really quick.  Goddamn it! All right.  Attention, everybody.  Irish honor system.  Please serve yourselves.  Put the money in the bucket. Thank you. (cheering)  Uh, I don't think the Irish honor system's a thing, man.  Oh, it's a thing.  It's an ancient Irish tradition.  Know your history, bro.  What could possibly be so important?  Charlie  what the hell am I looking at?  (groaning and muttering)  CHARLIE: I caught him.  Wake up that son of a bitch.  Dude, I think you've kidnapped a little person.  Huh?  Nah nah, nah. First of all,  I've captured a leprechaun, okay?  You wouldn't say, "I kidnapped Bigfoot," right?  You'd say, "I captured Bigfoot."  Well, that may be true, but leprechauns aren't real.  So what we're dealing with here  is a little person in a glue trap.  Yeah, I thought about that, ruled it out, okay?  'Cause the basement door is locked, so unless  he's a being who's unrestrained by the laws  of the physical world, he's not getting down here, man.  Dude, if he is a human being,  he's going to sue the shit out of us.  If he's a leprechaun, he's got a pot of gold.  Yeah  Well, yeah, that's No, no.  Well, let's not rule one out over the other.  I mean, it's very weird  that he's down here, right?  MAC: Okay. Let's ask him.  Uh, sir, I'm gonna ask you a direct question.  Are you now or have you ever been a leprechaun?  No, I'm not a goddamn leprechaun!  Please It was pretty convincing.  Are you kidding me?  If he's a leprechaun, that's what he has to say, right?  Sir, why are you dressed like a leprechaun?  'Cause it's St. Paddy's Day, you idiots!  This guy's good. He's good. (clicks tongue) Yeah.  Nasty little son of a bitch, isn't he? You think?  There's, like, a real bite to him.  I know. You know what I think we should do?  We just rough him up a little bit.  You know, just get the truth out of him, just a little bit.  It's a great idea.  We don't want to bruise him up. Yeah.  You know, so, I just wish we had, like, a hose or something.  Yeah. You know, we could blast the truth out of him.  Right? That'd be good  Oh, shit. There's a hose right here.  I I don't ever remember a hose being down here, do you?  No. I don't know. Dude  do you realize what just happened?  You made a wish, which the leprechaun clearly granted.  You know, everyone knows, you capture a leprechaun,  you get three wishes, right?  So we got to think very carefully what our next two are here.  I wish I could live forever? What are you doing?!  I wish you don't. How about that? No, no! Why did you do that?  Why did you do that? Why didn't you say,  "I wish I could live forever."?  And live forever with you?! Well  Look, I'm not a leprechaun!  Just let me out of here, you dickheads!  Ah. Wish there was a way  we could just know for sure, you know.  Charlie?  Get the snake.  DENNIS: The problem was, Frank  that last group of belligerent hooligans just didn't understand  how to experience our business properly,  but I think this new group is gonna get it.  Plus, they're physically weaker,  in case anything goes wrong.  What's happening?  (with Irish accent): I'll tell ya what's happenin'.  One day you're young and pretty,  and the next, the years of drinking and abuse  have robbed you of your youth.  Abuse? Did these guys hurt you?  No!  Me husband did this to me.  Arrr!  Dee Mm?  What the hell are you doing?  What are you? What, are you a pirate?  I can't tell if you're doing a thing now,  or if this is just who you've become.  (normal voice): I've giving them  an authentic Irish experience,  like you were begging for before  You're giving them a completely inauthentic,  frightening experience, and you're scaring them.  Okay, listen, ladies, nobody's gonna get hurt.  Will you just let us out, please?  Well, no.  No, I'm not gonna let you out.  I need you to experience everything  I-I have to offer, okay, so you're  Rahr! So, experience Dee!  Shut up!  All right, look, we're gonna have a good time here, okay?  You're experiencing some free beers right now  because I can't get the goddamn Internet to work.  That's a problem for me. Do you guys know how to use  tablet computers? You're young. No.  I just want to connect the goddamn thing to the Internet.  They told me it'd be easy. It's not, though.  Okay. Well, I'll tell you what.  I'll let you out after I take a couple photographs of you.  How's that sound? Yeah? Take some photographs  for my for my Web site? So, look happy.  Look like you're having fun. No need to cover those up.  My customers like those. They're like me.  They're gonna want to see that.  Yeah, okay, so smiling smiling and  (camera shutter clicking, women crying)  You're not convincing me. Smile!  (sobbing) Oh, damn!  This is not supposed to be scary.  This is supposed to be an authentic, fun time for you.  (camera shutter clicking, women crying) Yeah, all right, well,  I need to buy it, okay?  I'm Please let us out.  I don't want to be on your weird Web site. Shh.  Well, if you don't comply with me, then you're gonna end up  on the weird one, okay? So, smile.  (crying) Ugh! All right.  You know what? This isn't gonna work.  All right, come on, come on.  Let's go. Come on.  All right, out you go, ladies. Out you go.  I know you didn't threaten to call the cops,  but you would have-- I'm certain of it--  so I'm gonna need your wallets and your phones.  Give 'em to the girl.  Oh, yeah, I'm probably gonna pop on your Twitter accounts,  just so you know. Write us some, uh, enthusiastic reviews,  which you would have done, as well,  had you experienced our business properly,  but you decided to be  (sighs) All right, well  (tires screech)  (women sobbing)  Talk, bitch! I'm blasting you! Come on! Talk! Come on, leprechaun!  Come on, leprechaun, admit it! Where's the gold?!  Aw, what's the point, dude? There's no water pressure.  I feel like I'm giving him a baby bath. Yeah, I know.  Snake's not working either, man.  Well, that's because the snake is dead.  Because you put it in a plastic bag and it couldn't breathe.  All right, doesn't matter. He probably killed it  with his leprechaun magic, anyway.  I'm not a leprechaun, you goddamn assholes!  Yeah, yeah, guy. How are we gonna get his pot of gold  if he won't even admit to us that he's a leprechaun?  I mean, if this guy would just admit he was a leprechaun,  we could be done with this whole mess. Well, yeah.  Of course. LEPRECHAUN: Okay, fine, you got me.  I'm a leprechaun. I admit it.  What?  God I am a I'm a  damn a I'm a leprechaun.  Yeah, right, but you don't have the accent, That's  and that's throwing me off, right? It's throwing me off.  (Irish accent): I live in a faraway land,  and I was transported here  by a giant magical rainbow.  And you never got me Lucky Charms.  (laughing): Oh! That's it! That's it!  You were right! Dude! You caught a leprechaun! I told you, man! I knew it!  Hey, can you let me go now?  No, you can't go. You know No. No.  we need your pot of gold. Where is it? Yeah.  It's at the bottom of the rainbow.  Hmm. Must be some sort of leprechaun riddle,  'cause there's no rainbows out today.  No, dude I don't think this guy's talking in metaphors.  I think he means exactly what he's saying. Yeah?  Dude, he's talking about that gay bar  down on Locust Street-- the Rainbow.  You know which one I'm talking about, right? No.  Right. I'm gonna go check it out, alone.  Why?  Well, because you'll be here.  And if, uh, the gang comes back,  they'll also be here, and I'll be there, alone.  Right.  But you'll be here.  Great. Great.  All right, you go do that, Okay. Yeah.  and, uh, remember, you're there to look for a pot of gold.  Okay. Alone.  Yeah. You'll be there, alone.  Okay! Got it.  All right, well, that just leaves you and me, and, uh,  we both know there's no pot of gold at that gay bar.  So the question is  what to do with the little liar.  We haven't made a goddamn penny today.  We actually lost money,  with all the gas we burned going back and forth.  Yeah, well, it's not my fault. The business model's flawless.  If you knew how to drive and you knew how to serve  a goddamn beer, we wouldn't be in this mess.  (sighs) Hmm.  All right. (grunts) Mmm.  Okay, everybody out. Get out. Let's go. Come on.  Go, go, go, go, go. You guys are in the wrong demographic.  Where have you taken us?  Right. Yeah, I guess, uh,  we got so used to our routine of picking people up and dropping  'em off outside of town that we never even tried  to sell you people beer, did we? (laughs) They're too old, anyway.  Who's gonna watch 'em on a Web site? That's true.  Yeah, you guys are a little too old for our, uh (woman shrieks)  So Wallets and phones. You know the drill.  I don't know why we don't just do the car service thing.  People seem to be really needing rides all over the town.  No, you know, that idea may work. You think so?  Thank you. You're welcome.  Oh. B-But before we pivot to that one,  um, Deandra, you mind, uh, jumpin' out  to see about the gas cap? I think I left it off.  Yeah. (tires screeching) Oop.  Oh! Hey!  Oh, goddamn!  Goddamn it!  (groans)  What you did there, Frank, that's, like Very funny. Yeah. That bitch  was dragging us down. Yeah.  She was driving me crazy, man. Oh.  Oh shit. What?  She didn't put the gas cap on.  Oh, is it open for real? Big-time.  Oh, shit. Yeah, let me grab that real quick.  I got it. (grunts)  No, no, no, no, n Aw, goddamn!  (groans)  (sighs)  I can't believe Uber jacks up their prices just because it's a holiday.  That's unbelie It's a scam.  We should have been doing that the entire time.  Are you kidding me? That was my whole idea.  Dee, stop trying to take credit for everything. Wait--  what is going on in here? Weren't Mac and Charlie  taking care of the bar? Yeah, they were.  Why is the bar empty? FRANK: It ain't empty.  What are you doing back here, you piece of shit?  It's a long story. The business hit a wall,  went up in smoke, and then went under.  Why are you speaking in metaphors?  It ain't a metaphor. I fell asleep,  crashed into a wall, the engine burst into flames,  and I had to drive it into a river. Right.  (music playing in distance) (muffled shouting)  What the hell is that?  to keep this smile from my face   Listen, Tony   I'm all over the place   Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right   Here I am, stuck in the middle with you   Well, you may be a man.  You may be a leprechaun.  But only one thing's for sure:  You're in the wrong basement.  Goddamn it! No!  I'm gonna see if you bleed green. No! No! No, no, no!  Whoa, whoa, whoa, Charlie, Charlie, what the hell is Whoa, whoa. Hey!  What are you doing?  (music stops) What does it look like I'm doing?  It looks like you've tied a little person to a chair  and you're gonna torture him.  (chuckles) No, I've tied a leprechaun to a chair,  and, uh, yeah, I was gonna cut him to pieces.  Charlie  you been drinking straight paint?  Yeah.  MAC: Charlie, he's not a leprechaun!  Do not hurt him! I repeat:  he is not a leprechaun! Oh, hey.  What is this? Why are you covered in glitter?  I would love to answer all of your questions,  but there is no time.  You see, I went to the Rainbow to look for a pot of gold.  The gay bar? Oh.  Again, no questions.  And when I got back,  I found this bag full of wallets,  hidden where we keep the towels.  Why did you need towels?  Not answering questions, okay?  Because apparently this son of a bitch is a pickpocket.  That's why he's been lurking around Paddy's.  Oh! Well, that makes a lot of sense, 'cause he kept saying,  like, "I'm a pickpocket. I'm a pickpocket. Stop hurting me.  I'm not a leprechaun." And I just thought that was, like,  a metaphor for, you know, "I-I am a leprechaun."  This little son of a bitch has been picking pockets  at our bar every St. Paddy's Day  for years. FRANK: Well, we got a whole bag  full of wallets and phones, too.  You did? That's good. Because the bar did not do so great. Yeah.  Turns out the Irish honor system, that's not a thing.  Yeah, we were gonna actually return the wallets  that we got, but, uh, Yeah.  since no one seems to be  being honorable, uh, maybe we keep our wallets  and those and, you know, Yeah.  chalk it up as a win. Yeah. Oh, the luck of the Irish.  (chuckling) Let's not make it a tradition, though.  Sure. Yeah, probably better not to.  All right, well, what do we do with this piece of shit?  (tires screech)  (distorted laughter)  Oh, shit, that leprechaun just flew up a rainbow!  Stop drinking paint, Charlie. Huh.                     1 CHARLIE: First of all, I'd like to say I-I personally  didn't think any of us would be standing  in front of you here today.  No, no, I mean Shit, no.  I thought we were going straight to hell. Yeah.  Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Right, well  But that being said-- I mean, we're good people. Oh, yeah.  I did what I did. You don't like it,  you can kiss my ass. Oh, oh.  Easy, easy. Hey, could we be judged individually?  'Cause I don't want to be lumped in with him.  Look, I know you're gonna judge us.  But before that cruise ship went down,  we prayed. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yes. Yeah.  I mean, like, sure, we've done some bad things,  you know, but-but we've changed, I promise.  I'm gonna walk you through how. Mm-hmm.  So please just reserve your judgment, okay?  Because once we're finished,  I'm sure you will judge us accordingly.  Mm-hmm. (chuckles softly)   Goddamn, this ship is the tits!  Frank, Frank, watch your language. You know?  This is a Christian cruise.  Yeah, and I got to say, winning raffles, going on cruises--  I like this new church of yours, Mac.  I think you found the right one. Yeah.  Oh, I didn't find them. They found me. Ah.  And it's all, of course, a part of God's plan.  It's also a part of God's plan  that we all get closer to him through fellowship.  Hey, Mac, is God gonna be able to protect  against the ship sinking?  God protects all things, Charlie. He is an awesome god.  The only way this ship is gonna sink is if the captain's drunk.  Guys, we don't have to worry about drunk captains,  'cause this is the dry cruise, remember?  Yeah. Yeah, I do. And about that, um,  where exactly does God stand on that dry thing?  Is that a hard, fast rule or is there some wiggle room?  Look, this cruise is an opportunity for us to get away  from the sins of everyday life. That being said,  we will each have to have a half a cap of mouthwash every day.  You know, just to stave off the shakes.  Smart, smart. Don't want to get sick. Yeah. Oh, thank God.  Okay, guys, I am gonna head up to Bible study right now. Oh.  Oh, right now. Uh, this is our suite. Yeah, you guys can check in or whatever.  But the Do you want to meet me there?  Do we? Yeah, yeah,  we'll, we'll We got to  set our bags down and then, uh  Yeah, we I have to unpack, I always do.  All right. Peace be with you.  All right. Okay. Yeah, yeah.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  You're supposed to say, "And also with you."  Why is that? Would you say  I'm not gonna say that. Uh, you know what, I'll say it,  if it's gonna help you get out of here  and go to your Bible study. But I'm not gonna mean it.  Oh, you don't have to mean it.  Yeah, you just have to say it.  Okay. And also with you. Bye.  Guys, this is gonna be the best cruise ever. And also with you.  Yeah. I'm not saying it.  Take care. I'm not saying that.  Oh, my. Oh, my. Oh. You don't have to mean it.  Mmm. Yeah.  Oh, shit. (rumbling growl)  Yeah. I needed that.  Man, and the beer calms my nerves, too, you know  what I mean? I feel like I could drink that whole suitcase. Oh, God,  me, too. But let's not, okay?  'Cause this is the only alcohol on the entire ship.  Ooh, yeah. Yeah. All right, okay.  That'd be bad. But it's time to suit up now,  so we can get into some nonsense. What do you mean, suit up?  Did you bring costumes?  Yeah. Yeah.  I'm gonna be the captain.  Charlie's gonna be the first mate.  No, no, no, I-I'm putting  a stop to this right now.  No costumes, no high jinks.  Okay? Can we just Guys, can we take a vacation  from our usual bullshit?  You know, I'm not saying we got to do the God stuff,  but let's not-- let's not do a bunch  of anti-God stuff either, okay?  So don't be gluttonous.  Okay? You-- no wrath.  No lust for me. You know, which is gonna be difficult,  given the implications of being on a boat.  All right, well, I'm taking a vacation from you guys, okay?  I'm tired of getting shit on. All right.  That's what I'm talking about, Dee. Nobody's gonna shit on you.  Nobody's gonna call you a bird.  I agree. But first, I got to take the cross off Oh, yeah.  that Mac gave us. This thing is burning me to shit. Yeah, yeah.  There. Look at that. Oh!  DENNIS: Oh.  DEE: Oh! Goddamn, Frank.  Oh, my God.  You might actually be the devil.  Jesus, I'm gonna take mine off, too.  I could be Satan. (laughs)  Screw God!  (thunderous horn blows)  Whoa, whoa, what-what was that? Did-did God do that?  No, no, no. Don't go crazy on the God stuff, all right?  That being said, the timing of that big boat noise was  pretty suspect, so, Frank, maybe don't push his buttons?  Yeah. I get that. Yeah.  All right, I'll leave him alone.  Hey, Mac.  We are about ready to get started. You feeling okay?  Yeah, David. It's good. I-I just, uh,  was waiting on my friends.  They said they were gonna be here and they're not here yet.  I should have taken on a missionary position with them.  You know? They need salvation.  Especially my one friend, Frank.  I even started putting battery acid on the back  of his cross necklace to burn through his skin.  Why?  Oh, to subtly send the message  that he might be a demon.  Oh, well, yikes.  Uh, listen, when your friends are ready, they'll come.  Right, yeah. You know, we should just get started.  Scott, you ready to go? Yup, yup. All right,  everybody, why don't we gather around.  Why don't we, uh  Well, let's just  We'll sing through it once  and we'll get it on its feet.  (upbeat tune playing)  Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,  guys what's that song?  I-I'm not familiar with that hymn.  Uh, the song's "Sit Down, You're Rockin' the Boat"  from Guys and Dolls.  It's for the talent show. We do it every year  on this cruise. It's fun.  Fun? No, no, the songs aren't supposed to be fun,  they're supposed to be bleak and dreary,  so we can focus on how bad we are.  Yeah. We need to punish our ears  to pay for the original sin of being born.  Mac, look, uh, I know it can be difficult  transitioning into a new church.  All we ask is that you try to keep an open mind.  Okay, I Maybe I can do that.  I But, guys, I can almost guarantee you  that I'm not gonna like this.  Said to myself sit down   Sit down, you're rockin' the boat   And the devil will drag you under   With a soul so heavy you wouldn't float   Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down   You're rockin' the boat!   Yes!  Yes!  Yes! Yes!  I feel like I've been waiting for this my entire life.  Good. We're glad you had fun.  Yes, yeah. I'm ready to go again.  Well, you've already gone twice. We're sort of  taking turns We're gonna go  from the top. Five, six, seven, eight  These winter coats were a good idea-- it is chilly. Yeah.  Come in handy. You don't want  They're cranking the air conditioning.  Yeah, you don't want to be sick on a boat.  Whoa, look at this place.  I think we died and went to heaven, Frank.  Oh. Dude.  I thought you said they didn't have alcohol.  Look, they-they got screwdrivers.  Oh, no, Charlie.  That's just orange juice.  There's no alcohol. Just orange juice, like the mixer?  Yeah. Yeah, people drink it.  People drink it. Yeah. That's crazy to me.  When was the last time you drank straight mixer?  Oh, I had a diet cola mixer a while ago.  Oh, did you? (burps)  Was it any good?  Yeah, oh, yeah. Whoa. (sniffs)  What? Dude.  You drinking a beer right now?  What? Get out of town.  You can lie, but that burp told me the whole story.  You holding? What you got?  You smell the beer? You holding beer?  Come on, man.  Bingo! (laughs)  MAN: Excuse me.  You can't have alcohol on the ship.  Oh, this, uh, this is an empty.  That-that was an empty can.  A pelican dropped it and we Yeah, we picked it up.  Yeah, it was, like Do you have  any more on you, sir?  No, not a bit. Yeah.  What's going on here? Uh, uh, Captain.  Do you have any more alcohol on you?  Uh, not a bit.  If you'll excuse me. Yup.  Whoa!  What the hell is that, Frank?  Well, I don't want to run back and forth  to the cabin all the time, it's so far away.  Son of a bitch!  And you-- you have any beer on you?  Aah!  Charlie, you lied to me.  Uh, well, you lied first, man!  Is that the rest of it? Yeah, that's all of it.  We have to confiscate all these beers from you. Okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, got it.  DEE: Whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no, no, no.  That's my seat, bitch.  Excuse me.  Sorry. Got a little worked up.  Uh, not quite in vacation mode yet.  Let me try again.  Um, please get your shit off my seat.  I don't see your magazine or towel on it,  and I got here first,  so I don't feel like it's really your seat.  I'm sitting with you. Thought you were taking a vacation from us.  Yeah, I was trying, but this is the only seat open,  so can you try not to shit on me  for, like, the next hour or so, please?  I'm trying to relax. Dee, relax.  I'm not gonna shit on you.  Okay? Nobody's shitting on you.  How's it going with the wrath thing?  You, uh, staying away from that?  Well, yeah, you know, I was trying,  but there are certain "see you next Tuesdays"  on this ship that are making it very difficult.  Well, yeah, I feel you. I'm  I'm already struggling with the lust thing.  See this, uh, flaxen-haired seductress  across the pool over here?  Dennis, she looks like she's 12 years old.  No, she's of age. I checked.  Well, she's gallivanting around, you know,  flaunting it for me, and she knows how easy  it would be for me to have her, too,  because of the implication.  Not that you would understand.  It's not what you think it is.  No, I think I get it. We're out in the middle of the ocean.  She's stuck on a boat. She couldn't possibly say no,  'cause something might go wrong for her if she did.  That's that's exactly what it is.  How did you get that so fast?  It's like when I'm alone with a guy,  and we're messing around, and he gets all skittish about banging.  So then I insinuate that it would be a shame  if my account of what happened was different from his  and then he ended up getting a call from the sheriff.  You know what I mean?  And then, boom. We plow.  Okay. Yeah. No, I-I think I get it.  Yeah, right? Right, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  (gasps) Oh, my God!  Oh, a bird shit on me! Oh.  A bird shit in my mouth!  A bird shit inside of my mouth!  (muttering gibberish)  I'm literally getting shit on.  I'm literally getting shit on!  Hit it! Hit it! Hit it! Whoa!  Oh, yeah! Hey.  Hey, fellowship was fun. Yeah, see?  It doesn't have to be all dour and penitent to praise God.  Is it my turn? Absolutely. Step up.  Okay.  Aah! No!  I failed! It's okay.  I failed. I failed you. Nah.  No. I failed God.  All right, get me good. Whoa.  Hello. What is?  I brought my cat-o'-nine-tails. Yeah.  You know, so, flagellate me. Three-three lashes for missing.  Why would you want me to do that?  So I could be a better boy.  Mac, it isn't a sin to miss, okay? That's  We don't punish ourselves for that.  You don't punish yourselves?  Then how do you become closer to God?  By just appreciating the game and the wonderful day.  Well, sure, yeah, it's a wonderful day now,  but look at that storm coming.  (thunderclap) That's impending doom right there.  He-he probably sent that storm because I keep failing him.  Look, just relax, try it again,  and this time, hey, no guilt.  No guilt?  Okay.  Oh, my. Yes!  I did it! I did it! All right.  In your face! I beat your asses.  (thunder rumbles) Whoa. Gay. Gay.  Gay, gay, gay, gay.  What are you doing? Why are you two kissing?  Uh, because he's my husband, and we love each other.  What's going on?  What-what about God? You-you heard him.  He clapped and said, "No! Boom!"  You think thunder is God clapping?  Oh, no.  Oh, no. (thunder rumbling)  FRANK: You think there's gonna be anybody here with talent?  I mean, this is a Christian cruise.  This is gonna be boring as shit.  I'm anticipating a boring show.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, there she is. Hmm.  Sitting by me again, huh? Shut up.  I need something to wash the bird shit taste out of my mouth.  Oh, yeah. I saw you guys. Where are the beers?  In the captain's stomach.  Yeah. CHARLIE: Yeah, it's, uh  We kind of got, like,  you know, caught with them.  All of them?  Yup. Pretty much, yeah.  I knew you couldn't stop from being gluttonous.  Oh, you guys. Uh, all right, fine It was a mistake, man.  Give me the mouthwash. I need the mouthwash then.  That's gone, too. I kind of drank all of it.  Charlie drank it. He needed to calm down. You serious?  Goddamn it! (thunder rumbles)  It doesn't do Oh. (electrical buzzing)  Whoa. Whoa. See. Oh!  See, I don't like the storm, man.  The storm's starting to freak me out. You know what I mean?  Yeah, WTF? Yes, yes, the storm is intensifying.  And yet I remain calm in spite of the fact that this  one here is dressed like this.  Uh That's just crazy. Yeah, it is weird.  This girl in the sweater? He's been doing it all day.  You think that's? Can you just can you just drop it?  Well, I would if she wouldn't always be sitting in my eyeline.  Then again, that is what she does.  She wants me looking at her at all times.  She's driving me nuts, I'll tell you.  Maybe I'll send her a drink or something.  A virgin daiquiri for the virgin? MAC: Guys, guys, guys, guys,  guys, guys, guys, guys, I've got news, I've got terrible news. 
 Oh, see this is exactly what I wanted a vacation from.
 CHARLIE: Of course you do.  There are two guys in this church DENNIS: Yeah.  that are gay.  Who's the other guy?  (laughter)  I don't get the joke. (overlapping chatter)  What's wrong with that? So what? Well, guys, being gay is not Christian.  (electrical buzzing)  DENNIS: Oh!  Oh, see? That's that's freaking me out.  That's the big man! That's the big man. I don't know what it is,  but I don't like it. Let's go find our beer, man.  We're gonna go snoop around, see if we can find our beer. Let's look for some alcohol.  Recover that beer and bring some back.  Yeah. Don't take 'em all. And why is?  MAN: Ladies and gents,  it's talent show time. Please welcome  Marlene, the magician.  That's the bitch who stole my chair!  Magic? The dark arts? Are you guys serious?  First the queers. Then sorcery?  This cruise is going straight to hell. Okay.  I'm out of here! All right. See ya.  Peace be with you.  We're not saying that other bit. No.  Aah!  For my first trick tonight,  I'm going to need a volunteer.  Hmm. Hey, you, bird girl.  Come on up. Can you believe this bitch?  (laughs) Go. Go up.  I don't Bird girl.  Yes, we call her bird. We also call her a bird.  (thunderclaps)  Oh, baby. See? These costumes are a great idea, Frank.  (laughs) So we can go anywhere we want on the ship now.  Anywhere we want. And nobody's gonna know.  That's not exactly the first mate's costume I had in mind.  Hey, man, you said "first mate." That's gonna do.  I was, like, Gilligan. That's the only guy I know.  Yeah, no. It's good. It's good.  All right, so what do you think?  We find the captain's quarters,  kick down the door, find our beer. Oh, no.  Strangle the guy or something. Oh, no, no.  That beer? That beer is long gone.  No, we don't want to do that. Drank it, huh?  Oh, the party is right down here.  And right down here below deck. This is the party?  That's right. This is it. I don't hear anything.  All I see is a bunch of pipes.  How is this a party? The pipes are the party.  The pipes are the party? Yeah.  What are you talking about? Well, all the booze we're ever gonna need is  running through these pipes.  So, what? Wait, wait. We're just gonna drink straight boat fuel?  No. We're gonna cut it.  With what?  Mixers.  Hmm? Mmm.  (chuckles) Oh, good. Yeah, you got one of those.  (clang) Lord, hear my prayer!  The only reason I went to this church in the first place  was to become closer to you!  Well, that and the other church was getting super Vietnamese.  I just need to know my purpose!  I-I used to think it was worship  and then song and dance!  I got to be honest, I've really taken to it,  and I think musicals are gonna become  a huge part of my life moving forward!  But now with these gay Christians,  I don't know!  I need you to show me a sign  to tell me my purpose here!  Maybe some lightning!  Maybe some thunder?  No?  Should I have stuck with the Vietnamese?  Is this your card?  (applause)  DEE: Can I can I have the deck, please?  I-I got a trick that'll blow you guys out of the water.  Wait, I'm confused. Is that a challenge or a terrorist threat  to the ship? (laughs) (rimshot)  (Dee laughs mockingly)  Give me the goddamn deck.  By all means.  Pick a card, any card.  Hmm  Now take a good look at that card, please.  You might want to bring it a little bit closer,  just so you can see it well. A little bit closer. Great.  Now, tell me, what suit is your card?  Spades. Spades. Ooh. All right.  Now watch while I turn  these spades into stars. Oh!  (gasping)  DEE: Oh, shit!  Who's getting shit on now, bitch?  MARLENE: What is wrong with you?  You knocked out my tooth!  (booing) Did I? That wasn't the plan. I didn't mean to-- I-I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to do that.  Get off the stage, bird girl!  She stole my chair at the pool, and I got so hot about it.  Hey, hey. What? No, no, no, no, no!  Yeah!  What? No. Aw, no, come on!  Well, what is this, boat jail?  I'm not a goddamn Somali pirate, okay?  No, wait, wait! Ah  Goddamn it.  MAN (over radio): thunderstorms, capable of producing gale-force winds  The storm's worsening, Captain. What should we do?  FRANK: Fire the torpedoes!  What? Full steam ahead!  Christ, not you again! CHARLIE: Frank, I think I found  where he's hiding the beer! What do you got, Charlie?  No, no, it's just, like, wires and stuff. Yeah. Oh, yeah?  Put these men in the brig.  Charlie. Wait, wait. Ah, get your hands off  I'll dispose of those.  Oh, yeah, yeah, I know where No, no, don't let him drink that!  Don't let him drink our torpedo juice!  (sighs)  Dee?  What'd you get thrown in for?  I couldn't control my wrath. You? Yeah.  Gluttony. Yeah.  Been drinking boat fuel and shit. Oh, sure.  Sure. Yeah.  Oh hello.  (thunder rumbles)  Wow. I'm sorry. Didn't mean to scare you there.  Anyway, I, um I should have introduced myself earlier.  I'm the daiquiri man,  but I suspect you already knew that, didn't you?  (chuckles softly)  Was it good? Was it sweet?  I guess.  Well, it either was or it wasn't.  Yeah. Yeah. Of course.  Yeah. No, I had one, too. It was it was sweet.  You seem sweet.  I've been watching you  and following you, of sorts.  You know, in a good way.  So how'd you like that magic show?  Do you enjoy magic?  You know, I-I can do magic. Whoop.  Uh, how did you get that? Get your license?  Don't worry about it.  1996, though. That's good. That makes the cutoff.  There you go. I wasn't gonna steal it.  (clears throat) Um  So, how about this storm, huh?  I think it's kind of cool, you know?  Here we are on a boat, you know, out in the middle of  out in the middle of nowhere, and nobody would ever hear  our screams in this wind, you know.  Oh. (chuckles)  The thunder's really It's throwing this whole thing off.  It's making everything I say seem sinister,  which it's not intended to be, you know what I mean?  What's up? I-I'm sorry. I have to go.  No, no, no, no, no. No. Sorry, no.  It's There's nowhere to go. (chuckles)  There's really nowhere to go.  You know? So  why don't I, uh, come in your room?  (chuckles) "Come in your room." That's not what I meant.  I would like to go in your room.  Um, and I suspect that maybe  you might say no, and yet  I also feel like maybe  you wouldn't dare.  (screams)  Well, that's not supposed to happen.  Guys, come on, come on! It was a misunderstanding!  The storm made it seem way worse than it is.  She was never in any danger.  Lust?  Yeah.  Oh, my God, Mac.  You're soaking wet. Are you okay?  Yeah. I was out in the rain  looking for a sign from God.  I never got the timing right,  but doesn't matter.  The point is, I thought I was here  for you guys to open my mind.  But now I realized I'm here to close yours!  I'm sorry, what?  Guys, I'm here to convert you.  From being gay.  You want to convert us? Yeah!  You realize how insulting that is?  How would you like it if I tried to convert you?  Uh I wouldn't care.  'Cause that's, like, impossible.  There's no way you guys could convert me to your lifestyle.  Let's give it a shot.  Well  I'm gay.  Yeah. No shit.  Oh, you guys knew this already?  That you were gay? From the day we met.  Oh, my God, I've been trying Yeah, always.  Whoa, really? But what's going on?  Did you just get tossed in here?  Or, like, why are you in here? Oh, no, I just walked in on my own.  What?! You let the door close behind you?!  I couldn't find you guys. I wanted to hang out.  I had something important to tell you.  What is it? There is no God.  Well, what?! What is happening right now?  Why, where are you getting this from? Yeah, why  I was like (sighs) Okay.  If there was a God, there's no way  that he would make me queer, right?  I can't, I can't listen to this anymore.  I got to get out of here. I can't be around you.  I've got to get out of here!  Got to get out of here!  What are you squawking about?  Let me out of here!  Honestly, what's the point anyway?  There's no meaning to any of it.  There's no God, there's no heaven,  there's no hell. Wrong!  Oh, I just wanted a couple of days.  Just a couple of days away from you guys.  But I can't escape you!  You know where hell is, Mac?  You know where hell is? It's right here.  It's right now.  We are in hell!  (yells) Oh, Jesus.  (horn blaring)  What the shit was that?                          1 (thunder rumbling, rain falling)  Ooh. Man, that was, like, one Mississippi that time.  Yeah, that storm's, like, right on top of us, huh?  Yeah. It's kind of cool, though.  I mean, I can't think of a better way to have a movie night  than in the middle of an electrical storm. 
 It's kind of cozy, right?
 Mm-hmm. Cool, right?  Why do we have to watch The Wiz?  This movie sucks.  Well, it's Old Black Man's night to pick the movie.  Yeah, but he's asleep. Yeah, but, like  why do a remake of The Wizard of Oz? I mean, the original  was a classic. Uh, don't you think it's fair, though,  that they get their version? You know,  I mean, it's very difficult  being a black person in America, you know?  So what? Doesn't mean I want to watch Orlando Bloom  in Boyz n the Hood.  [DEE]: Yeah, I don't want to see that.  Oh, yeah, if you flip it it's weird, man, yeah. I would see that.  I would see that. I would see that.  I mean, look, this may be  a little bit touchy for me to say,  but, uh, you know, black people  They have a lot more opportunities these days.  Well, we did have a black president before the orange one.  Yeah, but that doesn't mean there's not problems.  I mean, what about the whole, like, Black Lives Matter thing?  Uh, well, sure, no, good point.  But, I mean, I don't know why it took 'em so long to realize  that their lives matter.  I mean, they-they've always mattered,  you know? But I would also say that all lives matter, you know?  And while black people may not feel like it,  it's kind of tough out there right now for everybody.  I mean, really, our lives aren't all that different.    (all grunting)  (groans) Whoa. Oh  What the hell happened? Did we get struck by lightning?  Uh, I think it came through the electric blankets.  Yeah, we got electrocuted. Holy shit.  Look at this the VCR's toast.  Uh, wait a sec  Where's Old Black Man?  Oh, my God. He's gone.  What the hell? What?  Uh  guys?  You're gonna want to see this.  What?  Well, that's interesting.     What the hell is happening?  Why are we black people?  But only in our reflections.  This is insane.  Are we in a dream? Do we got, we got to, like,  pinch ourselves or something?  Why is it daylight outside?  How is this happening?  Forget how. We're past that.  It is happening. It just is.  Give me one good reason   Whoa  
 What are you doing?
  Give me one good reason   Why we're this way  
 Why are you doing this?
  I don't have a reason   Whoa   I don't have a reason for a thing   That's happened today   I wonder why we're singing   Every word that we say   I wonder if we're living out The Wiz in some way   Uh, oh, well, no, it's not The Wiz, because nobody  switches bodies in The Wiz. Got to be something else.  I mean, I think we're experiencing something  a little more like The Hot Chick, The Change-Up   Here I go.  Vice Versa, All of Me   Like Father, Like Son   Dating the Enemy   A Boy Thing, A Girl Thing   13 on 30   Detention 
  Face/Off   Uh Right. Oh, actually, no, Face/Off wouldn't work, 
 because that's a face-switching movie.
 Yeah, no,  guys, I think we found ourselves in a Quantum Leap.  Hmm? What the hell's a Quantum Leap?  Oh, a great show from the coke-fueled era  of '80s television where Scott Bakula  would leap into other people's bodies,  but he didn't know it unless he saw his reflection.  These are not good reasons   Whoa   Now I'm just confused and I don't know   What the hell to say.   (music stops) 
 Wow.
 Shit. 
 Yeah, I don't know what that was.
 That was super weird.  Okay, guys, I think I know what's happening here.  I think we're in the respite of a musical,  where people can get out the necessary information  that doesn't fit into rhyme form.  Clearly, yeah, that's what's happening.  That's what's happening,  right? So let's talk fast be-before 
 another song starts.
 Okay, so Okay, that's a good idea.  You know what the problem is? We don't know the rules.  And there's no way we're gonna figure this out  until we figure out what the rules are.  (music starts playing) What are the rules?   Oh, Christ, I'm singing again.  What are the rules?   When you've just turned black   And you can't switch back   Well, you got to go   And find out the rules.   Wh Oh. 
 Oh. Oh, my.
 Yeah, yeah. Wow.  Holy shit, what have I done? Um, okay, look,  this is gonna keep happening, I think. Oh, God.  All right, so let's-let's figure this out, soon.  Let's split up, okay? Y-You two, 
 uh, go and try and find Old Black Man.
 Mm 
 I'm sorry Old Man. Just Old Man.
 Yeah. Yeah.  And, um, help him out, you know?  Do-do the Quantum Leap thing. See that thing through, in case  it's that. And the three of us,  we'll go out and, um, we'll try  to do the Freaky Friday thing  Try to figure out whose bodies we switched with.  But are they gonna look like us, though?  I don't know.  What are the rules?   What are the rules?   What are the rules?   What are the rules?   When you just turned black   And you can't switch back   Well, you got to go and find out the rules   I think we're in The Wiz   Don't force the Wiz thing.  Wait, where are my keys? 
 Where are my keys?
 You got 'em?  I can't  Wait, what is this? 
 It's a wallet.
 I know it's a wallet, asshole.  I'm saying it's not my wallet.  Oh.  I appear to be a guy named Reggie Williams.  Oh, shit. Oh.  Yeah, this is an interesting new rule.  It seems that even though we have our own clothes,  we have access to the pockets of our reflections. 
 What movie is that from?
 I don't know that one.  My pockets are empty. Oh! Maybe the lesson  we're supposed to learn is that black people are broke.  You're broke. 
 That's a good point. Yeah, yeah
 Oh, shit, hang on a second.  This kid's got 25 bucks.  Oh! Black people are rich. 
 That's the lesson.
 You know what, no, I think we're not  supposed to make wild assumptions about black people  based upon whether or not we have stuff in our pockets.  Yeah, that's that's just Don't make that assumption.  But I'll tell you what, you know what the first thing I need to do is?  Find Reggie Williams.  Uh, no, actually, that's the second thing.  I got to cancel my credit card, 'cause this Reggie guy might have it, you know?  Oh, right, that's the lesson we have to learn:  that black people will ruin your credit.  No What?  Dude, you you have to stop. And you have to stop. I mean  What are you talk I'm just trying to figure out what the lesson is.  We're never gonna zap back making these kind of  Well, hold on a second the thing I was saying was that I  would cancel my credit card no matter what race the guy was. 
 But you went right to it
 All right, you know what,  okay, fine, let's just find the guy.  Look, how are we gonna get in your car without your keys?  Oh, I can get in, man. I've lost my keys before. You just  got to kind of rock the car a little bit. Wiggle it down?  And check the back door, actually, 'cause sometimes 
 sometimes that's unlocked.
 Back door. 
 Like a wire hanger or
 Usually if I push it 
 a little bit, though
 A coat hangar somewhere.  Just kind of slide the window down  (siren chirps)  (indistinct police radio chatter)  [OFFICER]: Car 559, responding to robbery in progress.  Shit. Okay, look, it's all right, all right, calm down, calm down.  It's all good, it's all good.  You know, we can talk our way out of this.  We get out of this stuff all the time.  Well, I think we just found out a new rule.   (siren chirps)  This is the exact same place where I found Old Black Man 
 What. God, God, Frank.
 Oh, sorry, sorry. Old Man 
 Okay.
 In the first place.  You know what? This has got to be our mission.  I just feel it. We're just gonna find Old Man. 
 We're gonna find him a place to live.
 Yeah, yeah.  Like, we'll stick him in a nursing home or something.  You can afford that, right? 
 Right, right. And then
 Yeah.  When we turn white again, I'll stop paying the checks.  Oh, stop! Don't-don't say that out loud.  Just I feel like whoever zapped us here is probably listening.  Who's that? Who zapped us?  I don't know, Ziggy? They don't  They never really clarified on Quantum Leap.  They just, they just accepted it.  What? You mean nobody ever went after the guy for revenge?  Can you just move past it like they did?  Okay. Let's go find your guy.  All right, all right, but let me do the talking,  because, you know, guys like Z, they don't like strangers.  Yeah, but you're not you.  Oh, right.  Um, okay. Well, I got an idea  of how we can ingratiate ourselves to them.  Let's make one thing perfectly clear   I'm gonna say some words down here   I haven't had the chance to say before   Where are you going with this, Frank?  I'm gonna say "homie"   Oh, come on.  I'm gonna say "bro"   Are you serious?  I'm gonna say "my man"   Well, not you're just stereotyping.  I'm gonna say "fo' sho'"   Okay.  I'm gonna say the "N" word.   No, no, no, no, no. Stop, stop, stop, stop. 
 Why? Why?
 Thank you. No.  No, we're not saying that. 
 Absolutely not.
 Why? I'm black now.  It's probably the only chance I got to say it.  Why are you looking for a chance to say it?  Well, a lot of black guys say it.  Why-why-why should they get a pass?  It's just not the same, okay?  You're not one of them   Don't say them   No, that's not what I mean   What do you mean?   You're not one of us   That's just confusing   Now I'm getting lost   We'll say "N" together   Not saying the "N" word   We'll leave off the "E-R"   Not saying it that way   And that is the end   On saying the "N" word.  
 (gasps)
 What's up, my niggas? 
 Oh, well.
 (grunts)  What are the rules?  There you go. Hey, see? 
 You know what it is?
 Yeah.  I, uh, I'm black.  Uh too. Uh  I'm, uh, I'm black and I, I'm a friend of Frank's. 
 Right, right, right.
 And, uh  And I was looking for Okay.  A man, uh, you know, that Frank came  and brought to Dee's apartment to, uh,  sleep with a bunch of other people, and I  I don't, I don't know how to describe him.  He's, uh, old, and, uh, um 
 And he's
 And, uh  He's, uh, about this tall; he has  Nigga, you talking about Old Black Man.  He right over there laying.  [DEE]: How much does this guy sleep? Is he a cat?  All aboard. Chug-a-chug-a-toot-toot.  You really like that train, huh?  Can you put it down for a sec, so we can talk?  Well, I'm, I'm still playing with it, though.  Okay.  Listen, I'm a social worker,  and I have some questions.  Now, are those older guys your friends?  Oh, yeah. That's my gang.  Wait.  Y-You're in a gang?  Oh, not like a gang-gang, like a  Oh, right this must sound weird.  All right, how can I explain this? Um  Well, we hang in a bar   Where I like to clean the toilets   And I also kill the rats and get tanked   And I live in a walk-up   In some section eight housing   Where I sleep with a man named Frank   You sleep with him?  Unless he brings home a hooker   Then I sleep in the closet   Excuse me, can I make this train fly?  
 Um, sure.
 (imitating airplane)  Is Frank your father?  No, he's just some guy   That banged my mother   Like this guy and the other   She's a hooker and it's sad   But I don't feel all that bad   Guess I'm just another black kid   Who doesn't know his dad.   Guess we got that in common, huh, kid?  Oh, unless he knows his dad.  Oh, shoot. That was racist.  (mimics airplane)  (mimics fighter plane shooting)  This is bullshit, man.  Th-This is total discrimination.  Well, we were breaking into a car that wasn't ours.  But, dude, I think we've got bigger problems on our hands. 
 What if we have priors?
 I do have priors.  Oh, I have priors, too.  I-I didn't mean us, I meant them.  Dude. That could be  He probably does have priors. You prob 
 Yeah.
 Oh, no, see. No. Let's not do that.  Let's not go there, man.  Let's not draw conclusions   They're only just illusions   Never, ever, ever just assume   Right.  The road is always two ways   And assumptions make bad through-ways   Let's open our hearts for much more room   Yes.  Like maybe I'm a doctor   Maybe it's just that   Or maybe I'm a French chef   And that's why you're so fat   Maybe you're a fireman   Saving people's lives   [BOTH]:  Maybe we're just good men   With houses, kids and wives   Let's draw good conclusions   Let's make a better guess   Let's hope we learned our lesson   [BOTH]:  And just pray for the best.   Well, Reverend, I see that you and the deacon are praying.  I apologize about any inconvenience  and just want to thank you again  for all the work your parish has done  with the police athletic league.  [BOTH]: We're church blacks!  (both laugh)  Church people.  Yeah. Church we're just church people.  The fact that we're black is irrelevant. 
 Has nothing to
 (clears throat)  Will you look at this place, Old Man?  You will not have to be living with that Dee person anymore.  So it's kind of a win-win for everybody in this situation. 
 Carl.
 Ruth.  Where have you been?  Looking for you.  Children, did you find him?  Yes. Yes children?  We're their kids! 
 Holy shit!
 Oh, shit. 
 We reunited them.
 We did. 
 That was our mission.
 We did it! 
 Oh!
 Oh, God, yes.  Hey. What's all the hubbub about over there?  (gasping): Oh, shit.  Oh, what?  That's Scott Bakula from Quantum Leap.  [FRANK]: I thought you said  Blacula, like a black vampire.  Hey. So we were right?  Wait a minute, are you here helping somebody? 
 Are you leaping?
 Oh, my God.  The show I can't get away from it.  Look, that was just a TV character. I'm an actor. 
 Why do you got a mop?
 Researching a role.  So  You didn't get a piece of the show?  Your residuals ran out. I'm sorry.  I've been working constantly for 30 years, okay?  All right. Okay, yeah.  So Well, anyway, we just  reunited a family, and we're gonna, Yeah.  We're gonna leap. We're gonna leap now.  [FRANK]: Yeah, right now.  Ziggy, now!  It's not working. How do you do it? 
 How'd you do it on the show?
 Tell us how to do it.  Okay, just get out, okay? Hmm? 
 Get out. Everybody, everybody get out.
 [FRANK]: Wait.  Fine. Fine, Scott.  But listen to me.  Don't steal our leap.  Yeah. Don't steal our leap.  How did they know   That my wife took it all?   And I'm not researching roles   How did they know?   Ziggy, if you hear me   Take me far, far from here   Let me leap to '89   That was a better year   I miss my old Camaro   And my mansion in Van Nuys   Wish I still hung with Nash Bridges   Played poker with The Fall Guy   Oh, Ziggy, can you see   My tears?   Ziggy!   Leave me far   Far from here.   [MAN]: Hey, Hollywood.  Why don't you leap on up to the third floor.  Somebody shit all over the dining hall.  Okay, boss.    Dude, can I admit something to you?  I feel like that's the nicest the police have ever treated me.  Well, maybe that's the lesson that we have to learn.  That if you're an upstanding member of society,  then the police will treat you with respect.  Hmm. Although I still do suspect that we were arrested 
 due to racial profiling.
 Aw, I don't think so, dude.  No?  I think it's still, I think it's still unclear.  What are the rules?   Ugh. Here we go with this.  What are the rules?   When your race has changed   Life can be real strange   When you're trying to figure out all the rules  
 Hey, guys.
 Oh, hey. Hey. 
 Well, we're not in a Quantum Leap.
 What?  We reunited Old Black Old Man with his wife. 
 Nothing happened.
 Yeah, we ran into Blacula. 
 Bakula.
 Bakula. 
 Scott Bakula, the actor?
 Yeah, I think 
 he's trying to steal our leap.
 Yeah, he might be. 
 Mm-hmm.
 This doesn't make any sense.  See, we're not in a classic body-switching movie, either,  because we've been learning lessons left and right, 
 and we're still not changing back.
 Really? Huh.  Oh! What are the rules?   What are the rules?   What are the rules?   What are the rules?   When you've kept your brain   But the world's insane   How the hell you gonna find out the rules?   Well, guys, maybe we didn't keep our brains after all,  like the Scarecrow in The Wiz.  I grabbed Dee's VCR, 'cause I'm thinking  maybe if we get this thing fixed, we can get shocked again  while watching The Wiz, and that'll send us back.  Oh, my God! Charlie! I can't believe I didn't think of this.  Do you guys remember that electronics store  on Market Street? The Wiz?  It's called The Wiz! Yes!  Maybe we got to bring the VCR there.  Guys, I think we really are in The Wiz. 
 You called it, man, yeah.
 I don't know, I don't know.  We can't be sure, but, uh  at this point it does feel like the path of least resistance.  It's the only thing we haven't tried.  Yeah, right?  What are the rules?   Of being black in America   What are the rules?   Of leaping from your body   What are the rules?  Who can say the "N" word?   What are the rules?   I really wanna say the "N" word   What are the rules?   What are the rules?   Oh, shit, there it is! The Wiz!  We can't do that dance anymore. 
 That was exhausting.
 It's closed!  Hey, open up! We need your help! Open the door! 
 Back up. Here he comes.
 Ah.  What do you want? We're closed. 
 We're to see the Wiz.
 Yeah, we really got to talk to him.  There's no Wiz. It's just the name of the damn store. 
 Oh, yeah?
 Oh. Well, all right, man,  well, can you just fix this VCR for us, please? Yeah.  Go away. Come back when we're open. 
 Wait-wait-wait.
 Just-just hear us out.  Excuse me   Ooh  My kind brother   Ah   But can you lend a hand?   Ooh   Ah   We really are in trouble   Ooh   Ah   (high-pitched):  We really need a friend   Ooh, ooh   Ah   We're trapped inside these bodies   Trapped inside, we're trapped inside   Ooh   It's so hard to understand!   Ooh  But if you look inside   Our souls, sir   Ah   You'll see that we're white men.   (chuckles): Oh. Oh. Oh, I see.  Yes! I see it now.  Let me fix your VCR.  (excited chatter) Yeah! Oh, great!  Thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you.  That's a nice white man.  And the song helped. 
 [FRANK]: Yeah, it worked.
 911?  I'd like to report a disturbance.  [CHARLIE]: He's definitely calling the cops.  (all talking at once) 
 That racist bastard!
 Hey, you know what happened,  is we intimidated him 'cause we're black.  Oh, my God.  No. You know why he's calling the cops?  He's calling the cops 'cause he thinks we're insane people.  We were singing and talking about switching bodies and shit.  What are the rules? 
 Whoa-whoa-whoa.
 Ugh, I'm sick of that one.  I don't want to have to sing that song again.  All right? That being said, it is difficult to decipher  when exactly we're being discriminated against. Yeah.  Well, look, look, look.  Maybe that's the lesson here   Things are not always that clear  
 That's definitely true.
 They're not.  We have a lot in common   But too much of it   Is fear  
 (siren chirps)
 You're right. 
 Right.
 That's right.  So here come those police again   [DENNIS]: Shit.  But let me talk, 'cause they're my friends   They like me   They gave me this train.   He's got a gun!  (overlapping shouting) 
 Oh, God!
 They shot Charlie!  [COP]: Freeze! Get on the ground!  We just learned our lesson   Aah-aah, yeah!   A horrible lesson   Aah, yeah!   We just learned our lesson   And we wanna go home   Our home  White home   Just say home, we really   Really wanna go home   Let's click our heels together   [CHARLIE]:  Whoa, yeah   And pray we leave forever   Oh, yeah   We just learned our lesson and we wanna go home   Our home  White home   Just say home!  We really, really   Wanna go home   O ver the rainbow!   I wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna go home   I wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna go home   I wanna go home. I wanna, wanna, wanna go home   I wanna go home I wanna, wanna, wanna go home.   ALL (distorted, echoing): Go home! Go home! Go home!  Wake up! Hey, go home! Go home.  Go home! Wake up! (clapping)  Go home. It's morning. You know the routine.  Go home. Or wherever the hell it is you go during the day.  I had the craziest dream.  You were there. You were there. You all were singing.  All right, well, that's great. We don't give a shit,  'cause we don't like hearing about people's dreams.  Yeah, let's go, chop-chop. Come on.  Does this mean you didn't learn your lesson?  What in the hell is he talking about?  Learn a lesson from your dream?  How would that work?  Yeah, the only thing we learned is  that you have terrible taste in movies.  Yeah. Let's go. Come on. We'll see you later tonight.  Yeah. We'll see you, pal. 
 Hit the road.
 Do your day thing. Do your day thing.  He wants me to learn a lesson from his dream.  We got to have peace   To keep the world alive   And war to cease   Oh, boy.  What are the rules?  We got to have joy   True in our hearts with strength we can't destroy   People, hear us   Through our voice, the world knows there's no choice                          1 (children coughing)  Oh, Christ, does every single one of these kids have the flu?  Seems like it.  All right, now I bet you guys are wondering what's going on 
 with this racing suit, huh?
 No, not even a little bit.  You're like, "What's that rascal Charlie up to?"  "What's he up to this time?" Right, right? 
 I'm not thinking that at all.
 Yeah, yeah, well,  it's an issue of aerodynamics, really.  You see, every second counts in the water park. 
 Right.
 And we plan to ride 
 every single ride in there today.
 Yup.  Yeah, the brochure says three days.  We're saying bullshit to that. 
 We're gonna get it done in one.
 One day.  All right, well, good luck with that 'cause you got, like,  ten minutes of clean water and then every slide's basically  a urine delivery system. 
 Yeah.
 (laughs)
 MAC: We're not gonna get 
 drenched in piss.
 No.  We're gonna go in there, find our favorite ride, 
 bomb down it once,
 Yeah.  then sit by the pool the rest of the day disease-free.  Don't kid yourself about the water, buddy.  You're not gonna be disease-free;  this water's already infested  with every parasite on the planet.  And I, for one, have no intention  of stepping foot in any of it.  So what do you come to a water park for?  Hot food, cold beer, bikini'd women seeking relief  from the insufferable prison of motherhood.  Yeah, lot of pleasures to be had at the park, Frank. 
 None of which involve piss.
 Hmm.  And it's all free, too, if you know how to get it.  Well, it's not free, you got to pay to get in.  Not me, I had my bracelet laminated in the '90s.  I haven't paid to get in here since I was 14. 
 Nice!
 Nice, nice. 
 Oh, smart.
 Oh, shush! Shush, shush, shush, shush, 
 they're about to open!
 Why do we have to shush?  Oh, guys! I almost forgot.  Do not go near the pool drains,  no matter how good you might think they feel on your butt. 
 What?
 Huh?
 What?  You do not sit on those!  You know, because of the suction on your butthole? 
 No one's thinking about that, man.
 (all disagreeing)  No one's thinking about that at all.  Oh, good, 'cause it is bad news.  Those things will suck the intestines right out of you.  Like it did to that one kid back in '96.  Now, she had to chew through her intestines 
 just to get free.
 CHARLIE: When I see the drain,  I'm not gonna go try and sit on it. 
 Oh, here we go.
 Okay, here we go! Here we go!  We got to go! Get in there! 
 Go! Go! Go!
 Christ!    Kiddie Twister   Kiddie Twister   Here we go, here we go, here we go! 
 Yeah, Kiddie Twister!
 I'm so excited. 
 It's been, like, 20 years.
 What's that?  Uh, it's a urine tester.  Just want to be 100% sure.  It turns light red at the slightest hint of piss. 
 And I think we're good.
 Let's roll.  Hey, guys, guys, guys.  Slide's for kids only.  Size requirement.  Shut up, nerd! 
 (laughs)
 (whoops)  Kiddie Twister!  (whoops)  Screw you, nerd!  You're gonna get hurt  Uh, come on, nerd.  (laughs)  Whoo-hoo! Kiddie Twister!  I don't give a shit.  MAC: Kiddie Twister!  (whoops)  Kiddie Twis Oh, shit! 
 Kiddie Twister!
 Wait, Dee, no! 
 No, I'm stuck, wait!
 (Dee yells)  BOTH: Ow! 
 Shit!
 (Dee yells)  Ow! Ow, Dee, I'm stuck!  Yeah, no shit! 
 Dee, you got to move.
 Me move? You move.  You're blocking me.  Your stupid wrist band got us all jammed up. 
 It's not just that.
 (grunting)  The slide's too small, the nerd was right.  Shit, what are we gonna do?  Uh okay. Just remain calm, all right?  Do not panic, that's the worst thing you can do.  Okay, but we got to get unstuck before they send another kid  because oh, God,  some big, fat kid's just gonna come blasting down on us. 
 MAC: You're gonna be fine. Trust me.
 (thud, both yell) 
 Shit!
 Goddamn it!  Jesus Christ!  FRANK: This is slow, Charlie.  I'm never gonna get through this crap.  We should've gone down the first slide we saw.  I know, I know, but we needed to start at the northmost point 
 of the park, right?
 (groans) 
 Then we work our way south,
 Yeah.  and that cuts back on the excess 
 running back and forth.
 Oh, yeah.  You know, that said, I'm sorry I got us so lost.  I can't ever tell which way is north on a map.  It's at the top. 
 I thought north was, like, up.
 "Up"?  Yeah, like if I turn the map this way, now where is north? 
 Still at the top of the no.
 Down? 
 Now, come on, Charlie, this is ridiculous.
 It's confusing, right?  We got to get going here. 
 I know, goddamn it.
 Where's he going? 
 Coming through. Excuse us.
 What, what?  How come he can cut to the front?  Oh, Ethan is here with a special program  for children with leukemia,  so he skips to the front of the line.  Thank you! Coming through.  FRANK: AIDS!  AIDS, I got AIDS. I got AIDS, we're coming through. 
 Yeah, yeah, sorry.
 Cutting through.  I'm his doctor, my patient's got to get 
 to the front of the line
 Yeah. 
 Because he has AIDS.
 I got the AIDS.  He got it from a gay guy in the '80s. 
 I'm not gay, I didn't but
 Well  There's two kind of AIDS  there's the vagina AIDS and then the needle-based AIDS.  I-I'm a vagina guy. 
 Well, no, actually my test results show
 I got sorry, I'm AIDS.  that it was the gay AIDS. 
 All AIDS are bad.
 Well  That's no good AIDS.  But I'm telling you, like I said,  this is not the gay AIDS.  (indistinct chatter, splashing)  Lie back down.  One of these little stinkers yours?  My son.  This one here? 
 WOMAN: Mm-hmm.
 Oh, yeah, 
 he's adorable.
 (chuckling)  You?  Oh, daughter, yeah.  I try to take her to fun places like this.  Let a little sunshine back into her life  ever since her mom  Oh, my God. Did she  Die horrifically?  Yeah.  Drowning. Kind of ironic,  us being at a water park,  but, you know, you got to  you got to roll with the punches, you know?  Got to get back out there and live life  Daddy, Daddy, can I borrow $20?  What?  Oh, hi there, what's your name?  Abby.  I'm hungry, Daddy.  Can I please have $20?  Well, I think you can get something to eat  for a lot less than that, hon.  Dad!  I'm hungry, I'm starving,  and you haven't given me any money.  (sighs) Yeah.  What the hell?  (chuckles)  Anything for my little 
 Abby.
 (chuckles)  Interesting.  What's interesting?  Nothing.  I'm done with you.  Keep up. 
 Aah! Jesus.
 You'd think all the pressure  would blast us through.  No, it's just squeezing me further into the stuck!  Okay, well, get-get the bracelet off. 
 Just rip it off.
 Dee, I'm trying.  I can't get any actual leverage on it.  Besides, it's triple-laminated. 
 It's not just gonna rip.
 Oh, no. 
 I think someone peed.
 What?!  Sherman, did you pee? 
 No.
 Sherman, my vial 
 is turning light pink.
 MAC: Ugh  goddamn it, Sherman, I ordered you not to pee! 
 Sorry!
 Oh, disgusting!  Sorry's not gonna cut it, Sherman, 
 it's not gonna cut it.
 Nobody else pee!  Ah, the sun's just blasting me  right in the face.  Why does it have to be right there?  Dee, if God put the sun there,  there's probably a reason, okay?  Don't question him; we need God!  God didn't put the sun anywhere.  The sun stays still; the Earth moves around it.  (all scream) 
 Oh, Jesus Christ.
 Okay. All right.  We gotta get these kids out of here.  All right. I'm going for it. I'm just pulling on one of 'em.  Come on. Ah, this friggin' dome's like a magnifying glass.  (groaning)  MAC: Get him through, I can get him.  (Mac grunts) 
 DEE: Get help.
 Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Kid, kid, kid, listen. Come here.  Before you go,  no matter how alluring it is,  do not put your genitals or your butthole  near the pool drain. You got it? 
 In fact, cover your butthole.
 DEE: Okay, go. 
 Okay, kid. Go, kid, go!
 Come on. Go.  Cover that butthole, kid!  Mac. Stop talking to children  about their buttholes, okay? 
 It's not appropriate.
 Okay.  Okay.  Uh, I think we gotta get another kid out.  You know what?  What about this one?  That kid looks passed out, Dee.  Yeah, he's out cold, but I think  I can maneuver his body pretty easily.  Yeah, but if we send him down there, he might drown.  Guys, I gotta take a poop.  (Mac and Dee grunt)   
 MAN: I see you stealing.
 ABBY: I wasn't stealing them!  I just forgot I was wearing them!  Let go of me!  My dad's a cop!  Abigail! What is going on in here?  Where have you been? I've been worried sick about you. 
 This your daughter?
 Yes.  Officer Dennis Reynolds.  Hi. Off-duty, of course.  This is your jurisdiction. 
 Look, I caught her stealing sunglasses.
 Yeah? 
 No, I didn't! I was just
 Abigail,  I gave you $20 to buy whatever you wanted.  What happened to that? Do you still have it?  Yes.  Well, then you need to pay for these sunglasses.  Actually, no. You know what?  On second thought, no.  You don't get the sunglasses. 
 You need to be taught a lesson.
 I think that she gets  I really appreciate everything that you do.  Real police officer to security guard,  honestly, I want to thank you for everything. 
 Thanks.
 This little girl,  she's gonna be grounded for a month.  Come on, Abigail, let's go.  Try to touch me, and I'll scream "rape."  Please.  I see the road you're headed down:  the lying, the stealing, all of it.  And as somebody who's been down that road,  let me tell you something:  you've got real talent.  Okay  Mmm.  That ought to work.  What are you doing?  Oh, it's a simple lunch play.  I tell the burger stand  some hyperactive brat knocked my food on the ground,  they replace it, no questions asked.  I usually just swipe a burger  off some dumb-ass family while they're not looking.  Well, that begs the question, Abigail:  you want to be a thief or do you want to be an artist?  You see, an artist takes whatever  he wants when somebody's looking right at him. 
 These are too small for me.
 Yeah. 
 You get the point.
 Yeah. 
  Here comes the hot stepper 
  Murderer  
  I'm the lyrical gangster 
  Murderer  
  Pick up the crew in-a de area 
  Murderer

 Hey, man, go through.  Hey, go for it, go, go, go!  No, you need a raft! You need a raft!

 You goddamn nerd!
 Go. 
 We're making good time.
 We're doin' it, Charlie.  We're pretty much we're pretty much caught up.  Whoa, hey, hey, guys!  What are you guys doing? You guys doing a AIDS thing? 
 Oh, yeah!
 Yeah.  I gave Frank a couple hickeys 
 to sell the lesions.
 Sucked on 'em.  Yeah, yeah.  You doing a fake daughter thing? 
 Yeah.
 Cool. All right, man, see ya. 
 See ya.
 (starts fake crying) 
  I'm the lyrical gangster 
  Murderer  
  Excuse me, Mr. Officer 
  Murderer  
  Still love you like that 
  Murderer   (thud, screaming)  Act like you know, G go   I know what Bo don't know   Touch them up and go, uh-oh   Three, two, one, go!  (whooping)  I got AIDS!  (whooping)  Yeah! (whooping) 
 Frank, we did it, man!
 Charlie! 
 With time to spare!
 Charlie! We 
 Every single ride in here!
 We won!  CHARLIE: Hey! Hey, hey, hey!  Hey! Suck on that, river rat! 
 Every ride!
 (laughs)  (both laughing) 
 We did it.
 Oh, shit.  Frank. Look at this! 
 Oh.
 Oh  What what is that?  I don't know.  I mean, that-that's not on the map what ride is that?  Excuse me? 
 Excuse me, ma'am?
 Yeah?  What is this ride over here?  Oh, that's our new slide.  It's, uh, Thunder Gun Express.  We just finished construction.  It'll be open in a few weeks. 
 A Thunder Gun ride?
 Yeah.  Like the movie?  Yeah, but there's no water or anything yet, 
 so we still have to test it.
 Oh, yeah.  It's totally dry. 
 Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
 It's not, it's not  no, but it's not, it's, it's not open yet.  It's Thunder Gun, man. No hesitation. 
 No, no, no.
 No surrender. No man left behind.  We got to get to the top of that slide.  And raw-dog the shit out of it!  (indistinct chatter)  (huffs) 
 Mac?
 Yeah?  My vial is blood red.  That's because the water's not even running through anymore.  It's just pooling up. 
 Well, I got to tell you something, though, I
 Huh?  I don't know if I'm gonna be able to hold it much longer. 
 What?!
 I-I've been in here for so long, I-I  Don't you do it, Dee! Don't you do it!  The problem is it's already happening.  I'm peeing on your shoulder right now. 
 But I don't mean to, I'm sorry.
 (groaning) 
 It's warm.
 You bitch!  When we get out of here, I'm gonna kill you!  What am I supposed to do? How are you even holding your pee?  We've been stuck in here forever!  Oh, I peed as soon as we got in the slide. 
 Me, too.
 What?!  (laughter) 
 Ew!
 What?!  These animals are, they're laughing!  Of course they are!  I think they're actually enjoying this shit!  Oh, they love every second of it! 
 They're just pissing all over us!
 Goddamn it.  We're gonna die in here with them!  Wait, wait, wait. Wait a second, Dee. 
 I've got an idea!
 What?  If we can get Sherman's mouth  to this bracelet, we can get out of here.  You said you couldn't rip through it.  No, I can't.  But Sherman can chew through it!  Like the girl in the pool drain  when she got her anus stuck, she chewed through  her prolapsed anus and chewed herself to freedom. 
 What are you talking about?!
 Sherman!  Get your mouth to this bracelet and chew!  Aw, screw it. Try it.  Chew like you've never chewed before.  Go, Sherman, chew!  (indistinct chatter)  Whoa!  Whoa! Hey, hey, hey, hey! What are you doing?  I got some boy to give me this.  I said I'd kiss him if he met me in the parking lot.  Then I swiped his wristband, so he can't get back in.  (laughs) Nice.  Thanks. Well, I got to roll.  What do you mean? Where you going?  We're just getting started.  Yeah, but my mom said it's time to leave.  DENNIS: Wow.  That's a disappointing glimpse into your future.  Now, why don't you tell your mom  you want to stick around for a little while?  That won't work.  She never listens to me.  Oh, now, see, no. That bothers me.  A genius whose fate is controlled by an idiot?  You think I'm a genius?  Yes! Yes, I think you're a genius.  Are you kidding me?  When I was your age, I couldn't have accomplished  half the things you did today.  See, this is why the Chinese are destroying us.  If you were born in China,  you'd be the head of some factory by now.  Or they would've thrown you in a river,  'cause you weren't a boy.  All right, it's not a great analogy,  but you get my point.  A-Abby  you deserve better.  Here, I I want you to have it.  No, what do you mean? You earned that.  No, please, take it.  So you never forget me.  Thanks, Dennis.  For being the first adult to actually give a shit about me.  DENNIS: You!  Yes?  We need to have a conversation.  Your daughter is a special kid.  A gifted child who should be treasured.  If she were born in China, she  Wait, I already did that.  Didn't work.  If she were born in  What country treasures their women? 
 What are you talking about?
 What am I talking about?  Mom, can I have a slushy?  Yes, in just a minute.  Is that Abby's brother?  I don't have a daughter.  Yes, you do. The girl that was just  ABBY: Please take it.  So you never forget me.  DENNIS: See, an artist takes whatever he wants  when somebody's looking right at him.  What is wrong with you? Why are you?  (shushing)  (quietly): Huh.  (Charlie whistles)  How would you even describe something like that?  It's so beautiful.  They should've sent a poet. 
 All right, let's go, let's go.
 Okay. 
 All right, all right.
 Okay. 
 Here we go.
 (laughing)  Oh, oh.  All right.  This should be good, right?  Oh, that's great. 
 That'll do it.
 Oh!  Who's going first?  Well, it should be you, right?  I mean, you pulled off the AIDS thing.  Oh, Charlie! Charlie!  All right!  Let's go before we get caught.  Let's go before we get busted, okay? 
 All right, here we go.
 All right. 
 All right.
 Ready, Frankie! 
 I won't let you down!
 All right! 
 I like the spirit here.
 Oh! 
 (squeaking)
 Oh, it burns! It burns! It burns! It burns!  Aah!  (shouting)  (shouts)  My back!  That guy has AIDS!  Aah! Aah, my back!  (crowd clamoring)  AIDS! Everybody out.  Aah! Aah! 
 (Frank grunting)
 (crowd clamoring)  We're free!  Oh, my God!  Ah, we're free!  My God!  Is that blood?  There's AIDS blood in the pool!  That's goddamn AIDS blood?!  (crowd screaming)  Has anyone seen my son?  Goddamn it!  I hate this goddamn water park!  (dramatic music playing)                          1 MAC: No, your mom is the monster, all right?  My mom is the sweet one.  CHARLIE: Oh, the sweet one?  Are you kidding me? Uh, look,  if anything, my mom's aggravatingly sweet,  but we're not having an argument about who's sweeter, what  Whoa, whoa, hang on a second here, guys.  What are you going on about?  All right, look,  my mom's been calling me,  like, all the time, okay?  She's clearly upset.  Well, how would you know? You don't even answer.  My mom stopped calling me altogether.  Your mom stopped calling you  the day the phone was invented.  My mom has a great relationship with me. 
 She never calls you!
 She calls me all the time! 
 Yes, she does!
 But I have proof, anyway.  I have proof. Look at this.  I got this in the mail.  Is that, like, a ransom note from Mac's mom?  Huh? No. This my mom sent this.  Oh. Why would your mom write a ransom note to herself?  Oh, it's not a it's not a ransom note.  This is just how she writes notes to me.  That-that's like a bunch of gibberish, Charlie.  I don't know  Is that a hieroglyph of a dog?  Yeah, that's the animal my mom fears the most, right?  She-she feels trapped inside her own home.  There is no way  you could get that from this.  Oh-oh, okay, guys, guys, guys.  I think I have a pretty simple solution here.  You see, ever since I moved in  with Mac, and Dee and Old Black Man,  my surveillance system's just lying around in storage.  I got about a baker's dozen of cameras.  They're just sitting there.  I say we set them up in your mom's home  and find out what's really going on in there. 
 That could work. I mean, yeah.
 Great idea. 
 You don't think that's creepy?
 CHARLIE: What?  He's talking about spying on your moms.  So what?  You can't spy on unsuspecting women.  That's horrible.  Uh, they're not women. They're old.  At a certain point a woman goes from being a woman  to just being an old person. 
 True.
 Well, what happens to a man?  A man lives and then dies. Why are we having this argument? 
 A man remains a man.
 Dennis, it's a great idea.  Okay, and no one's gonna get hurt.  It's not like they're gonna get exploited in any way, right?  No, no, no, exactly. I think once we have a look  at what's going on in there, we might find the situation  to be, uh, pretty comical.  (laughs)    BONNIE: Oh, it's so nice of you to bring us  all these lovely gifts, Charlie.  The plant, the globe,  (cooing): and the little teddy bear.  Oh, no, no, no, no, Mom.  No, we aren't gonna touch the gifts, right?  Okay, we don't touch them. We just, we look at them. 
 Okay.
 And they look back at you and they Hands off.  Mom, make sure you don't water this plant. 
 Your mom's not gonna water the plants.
 Oh.  She has a very nurturing nature. She would  Oh, Mrs. Mac, are you gonna water the plants?  (groans) 
 See.
 Oh, Charlie.  I'm so glad to see you. 
 Yeah, okay.
 I was worried that 
 you were dead.
 Why?  (groans)  Oh, my mom also thought I was dead,  and she also loves me very much.  (grunts)  No, I don't.  Oh, she meant the first part.  She meant the first part where I  because she can't imagine a life without me, right, Mom?  I don't give a shit. 
 See.
 I'll put you out  of the misery of this conversation. Mom?  Is there anything you want to tell me  that's going on in the house?  Anything that's bothering you? 
 Anything you want to talk about?
 Mom, is there anything 
 that's going on in the house
 What are you doing?  that you want to talk about that's bothering you 
 What are you doing?
 in the house or I'm asking my mom a simple question.  You're asking her the exact same question I just asked, 
 so what are you
 Do you own all of the questions?  Do you own that question? 
 You're gonna steal my question.
 (Bonnie yells)  Ow!  Mom, what happened?  She poured hot soup on me!  I was adjusting my undercarriage,  and I accidentally spilled it. 
 She poured hot soup on her, dude.
 She was adjusting 
 her undercar Wait a second.
 What  Are you thinking what I'm thinking?  (gasps) We-we could also get some soup.  No, the-the video. We can go back and watch the video 
 and see what actually happened.
 Oh, we can watch and see Yes.    (Charlie and Mac arguing indistinctly) 
 complain about the soup.
 She's beating the shit out  Gentleman, welcome to your moms.  MAC: Wow, man. This is a serious setup.  Yeah, no, it's no joke. I like how you moved the desk. 
 All right, uh, look,
 Yeah.  there was an incident with some soup.  And, uh, did you get anything? 'Cause I'd like to see  if-if his mom poured on my ma on purpose.  Oh, she definitely did pour it.  And she definitely did it on purpose.  There you go. She's abusing my mom, man.  It's clear as day, but what's really interesting  is what seems to be happening right here  in the live feed. 
 Oh. You want to sleep.
 (snoring softly)  Well, I'll sleep you.  (snorts) 
 CHARLIE: Huh.
 MAC: Uh what the hell, man? 
 That's your mom abusing my mom!
 Well No, it's not!  That's just one of those things, you know, 
 like where
 What thing?  You know, where you're just like, you're like, it's like  a "Why, I oughta," but, you know, it's no big deal. 
 Why, I oughta what?
 Why, I oughta bludgeon you  with a hammer. But she's not actually gonna do it, you know?  It's like how Ralph Kramden on The Honeymooners would always  say, "Why, I oughta." He was threatening to beat his wife. 
 Uh, yeah.
 Yeah. You know? I mean, it's-it's funny 
 'cause he's not actually gonna do it,
 That was funny. Yeah.  even though the threat is always there. 
 Yeah, he might
 Yeah, he might cave her face in, 
 but he won't. He won't. Yeah.
 Yeah, yeah. But he's not gonna, you know? 
 That's
 Yeah, b Well, that's funny.  But in this circumstance, it's not funny because it's my mom!  Right, right. Wait, actually, you know what,  we-we don't really know for sure whether it's funny or not.  You know, let-let me try something here. 
 Let me just
 (rewinding) 
 You want to sleep.
 (snoring softly)  Well, I'll sleep you. 
 (snorts)
 (canned laughter)  Hmm. Well, what-what is that?  Well, I don't know, you made me think of, like, sitcoms,  The Honeymooners. I just thought, "This isn't very funny."  But if I add a laugh track, maybe, I don't know.  But it's not a show. This is their lives.  Yeah, but it-it does kind of lighten it up for me.  Well, yeah, it did lighten it. But I'm not saying it  Can can you play it again without the laugh track? 
 Yeah, sure.
 (rewinding) 
 Well, I'll sleep you.
 (snoring softly)  (snorts) 
 See, that goes right back to super dark.
 It's a bummer without it, isn't it? 
 It's not funny, it's not funny.
 Yeah, no.  Yeah, but let me let me just try it again 
 with the, uh
 (rewinding) 
 You want to sleep.
 (snoring softly) 
 Well, I'll sleep you.
 (snorts) 
 (canned laughter)
 (Dennis, Charlie, and Mac laugh) 
 That's funny. That's funny!
 I mean Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's weird, because the situation really isn't funny, 
 and you add a laugh track
 I know, but the laughing tells me that it's funny.  They have timing, man. 
 They have timing, for sure. Yeah.
 That's great.  I don't understand. Is this a dark situation or a comical one?  Well, we-we don't really know yet, Mac. We don't know. But  I tell you what, why don't we stick around back here  for a little while. Let's watch how this whole thing plays out.  You know? I'll keep sweetening the situation  as it calls for it,  and you might as well stick around.  (canned laughter)  Did you just ash in my tapioca? 
 Mm-hmm.
 (canned laughter) 
 Yeah. All right, yeah. I like that.
 (laughs) This is gold. 
 They got something, man. Like Uh-huh.
 It's really working.  I don't know what this is, but 
 What's this?
 Oh, check it out. Mrs. Mac  and Mrs. Kelly have a classic comedic rivalry.  I mean, they're going at it like the greats.  Like Abbott and Costello, Tom and Jerry. 
 It's amazing.
 Huh. 
 Oh, sorry. Fly.
 (canned laughter)  Buzz off!  (scoffs)  (laughing)  All right, well, you know, if you guys are looking  for a comedy troupe that beats the shit out of each other  for laughs, there's nobody better than the Three Stooges.  Put me on the show. 
 Whoa.
 What show? It's not it's not a show. 
 Yeah
 We're just watching our moms  to figure out what the situation is.  Wh I mean, it could be a show,  but, I mean, you're right.  It's-it's not a show.  Yeah, well it certainly looks like  you're trying to make a show,  and I think it's a good idea,  and I think you should put me in. 
 Why?
 Yeah.  'Cause I'm so much funnier than these two.  Look at them, they're just smashing each other with stuff.  I could add a whole, like,  physical comedy element, you know?  Hey, I smell chips.  What are we watching?  We're not really watching anything, yet.  Until Big Funny shows up.  You'll see.  Ooh.  Mrs. Kelly looks hot on screen.  CHARLIE: Come on, man, knock that off.  FRANK: There's something about people on TV.  Catch me up. W-what did I miss?  Uh, well, the grunty one,  physically abuses the shrill one.  And the shrill one psychologically abuses  the grunty one.  And it really plays.  It's really funny,  And, you know what, uh, actually,  I-I'm gonna try something here, guys.  (happy sitcom music plays)  You are a horrible woman,  and I can't wait until those cigarettes kill you.  And I shall dance on your grave.  (audience laughter)  Yeah.  This is so great!  And having those other people laugh  tells me when I should laugh. 
 Good.
 Yeah.  I love that.  And the music that I added makes you 
 you know that it's light.
 Yeah.  It's also helping me realize that I think the situation's  okay o-over there, you know?  And-and, honestly, I'm gonna ignore my mom's note,  like I ignore her phone calls.  I think we're good here.  They have chemistry.  And I really love  how playful and fun my mom's coming off. 
 Well.
 Uh, no. 
 Yeah, no, no.
 Never.  No, no. I actually find your mom very off-putting. 
 Yeah.
 She's hard-hard on the eyes.  Tough on the eyes.  And you know what else? 
 Like, super one-note.
 Yeah.  No! No, no, no, no.  My mom's got lots of notes.  She's a symphony.  She's getting so many laughs. 
 She's pushing the
 I'm concerned about longevity.  I mean, she's getting laughs from us,  now, sure, but, uh, I think that we're gonna  have a problem in the long run.  You just don't understand the nuance 
 of her performance.
 CHARLIE: I don't.  Cut to a close-up.  We need more close-ups.  (hacking and gagging)  Mmm.  (mouthing)  CHARLIE: And she's constantly looking directly  into the camera somehow. 
 She's repulsive.
 She is repulsive.  You know what? I'm gonna go over there  and-and I'm gonna show you.  Sh-she can pop, okay?  She's gonna pop. You'll see. 
 (phone rings)
 Uh-oh.  (humming) 
 Hang on.
 What's up?  My mom's trying to call me.  Hmm. Oh, wait, wait, wait, you know what?  Don't pick up. Don't pick up. 
 Oh, no, I never would.
 Okay, good.  But let's let that play out.  Camera one.  Oh, Charlie.  Charlie, please pick up.  One, two, three.  Charlie, where are you?  One, two, three.  Oh.  God, it's me, Bonnie.  I'm so worried about my Charlie boy.  Please don't have him be in a ditch somewhere,  or squished between two trains,  and his body mangled,  so if they move the trains,  all his guts and bodily fluids  and organs spill out.  Please, God  don't have him die.  AUDIENCE: Aw.  I knew it.  She's a star. 
 Huh.
 Charlie.  This-this could be huge. 
 Yeah?
 I mean,  I think this really could be a show,  with your mom as the star, I mean,  imagine what that would do for your mom.  I mean, w-what do you think?  Oh, shit.  Well, now I'm thinking  about my mom starring in a show, and I like it.  Um, now I'm thinking about minotaurs.  Now I'm thinking about a hoagie sandwich.  Now I'm thinking about a glass of water to go with the chips.  How-how many of my thoughts do you need?  Do you want me to go on and on, or  No, that's We're good.  Mom, you know that I think you are the most captivating  and beautiful woman in the world, don't you? 
 No.
 Oh!  I got something for you.  Sort of brighten you up a little bit.  What the hell is that?  Lipstick.  "Heartbreaker."  Just like you.  I ain't wearing no lipstick.  Come on, Mom.  Be-be agreeable,  which makes you rootable,  which makes you likeable.  (bleep) you!  That's a joke.  That's a joke, we will beep that, I think.  He will beep that, and that'll be funny.  Uh, you know, let me just, uh,  try and put some of this  Buzz off!  That's good buzz off.  You know, that's like, uh, a call back,  which could become a catchphrase.  You should probably think of a few more  so you're not just too one-note.  What about, um,  "I can't even."  Or, "That went well."  I'm gonna take a shit.  That's not a good catchphrase.  It is healthy, though.  (shouting): Oh  Cock-a-doodle-doo!  (laughs)  What are you doing?  Just the wacky neighbor, swinging by  with the usual hijinks.  Aga-aga-aga-agoo.  (crunching)  I'm sorry.  Do I hear someone upstairs?  Oh, neighbor!  Just swingin' by to say, "Hello."  Will you look at that?  I've got my dumb head stuck in the banister. 
 Dee's a nightmare, dude.
 It's awful.  CHARLIE: You're not gonna try and put a laugh in, or  Uh, nowhere to put it.  Yeah, you can't tell where the jokes 
 are supposed to be.
 Exactly.  Whoops. (chuckles) Okay.  It's actually a little bit stuck Mac?  (groaning): Mac, you want to come pull on me?  Dee, I-I don't know what you're doing,  because n-none of this is playing,  and you're not funny at all and  Hey, you know what, Dee?  From here, what you're doing  actually is kind of funny.  I wish we could get Mac out of there. 
 Oh, I know.
 Terrible.  He's making me sick. 
 Yeah.
 Ugly. 
  
 (doorbell rings)  Mrs. Kelly, can you please help me out?  Uh, my head is really stuck.  Um, I don't do well with emergencies,  and I have to answer the door.  (muttering) 
 Hi, Jack.
 Hi, Bonnie.  Just stopping by to pick up that hard drive  I accidentally left under the floorboards. 
 Oh, come on in.
 Okay.  Man, what is Uncle Jack doing there? 
 He's awful.
 Yeah, so creepy.  He's gonna ruin the show.  Yeah, that creepy pedophile vibe  he's got going on is going to be a tough sell.  You know, even in Europe.  Uh, let me try something here.  Let me take that jacket.  AUDIENCE: Ooh!  Thank you.  Mm.  AUDIENCE: Aw.  Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!  (laughing): That's funny from over here.  Yeah, yeah, just give me a good push on  W-what are you doing? Hey, w-w-what are you doing? 
 (loud fart)
 (audience laughing)  What the hell was that, man?  Wh-what, that fart?  I'm just trying some new stuff.  No, n-n-not the fart, no. 
 The fart's good.
 Yeah, no, I'm talking  about the-the sound effects under my uncle. 
 What-what?
 Well, uh  I'm trying to make him likeable  by turning him into the romantic lead.  Romantic lead?  They're brother and sister.  Yeah, the audience doesn't know that.  Well, you know what? I want to see her  bang somebody, but not him.  Yeah. All right.  What-what if you make him like a,  like a spy or something, right?  And he's looking for his hard drive, right?  Because spies are always looking for hard drives.  Or, or, or how about if you write in  some scumbag stranger comes in off the street,  and goes to town on Bonnie.  All right, look, I don't want to over-write this thing.  And-and all of a sudden you want to turn it into a spy thriller? 
 Well
 That's I don't want to genre jump.  Let-Let's just see how the romantic lead thing plays out 
 for a minute here.
 All right. 
 All right.
 All right? 
  Life is hard on your own 
 Oh! 
  Life is hard on your own 
 Ow!  But here's a place to call home   Old Lady House, where there are no laws   Old Lady House  
  They're in menopause 
 (farts)  Old Lady House   You'll never be alone.   Yeah? 
 (chuckles)
 What what do you guys think?  I mean, um, obviously, the audio is temp, you know.  But we could keep my singing voice if you like it. 
 I like it.
 I like it, and it feels like a real show,  and I love all the letters flying around on the screen. 
 Those are interesting.
 Those are names, 
 uh, 'cause it's a credit sequence, which is
 Okay.  pretty good, but-but why isn't my mom in the credit sequence?  'Cause I feel like she was popping.  You're lucky your mom's in the credit sequence at all.  Because I'm writing her off. She's terrible. Let's 
 Yeah, the word thing you did was good.
 Yeah, it was good, right?  I mean, we got to get somebody younger in there, 
 somebody hipper, somebody who's more fun.
 Yeah. 
 You know, preferably somebody of color.
 Okay.  What are you talking about? You can't kick my mom out.  She lives in the goddamn house.  Well, I'm gonna cut around her, then. 
 Yeah, we're gonna
 Until the ethnic comes, and then 
 we're gonna need your mom's room.
 We're gonna get an ethnic. 
 You can't get rid of my mom!
 I'm getting rid of her. 
 I'm going to cut around her.
 Mac, 
 she's out, she's out.
 I'm gonna  This is He thinks she pops. 
 She's terrible.
 Yeah. 
  
 Oh, Mrs. Kelly, Mrs. Kelly. 
 Mrs. Kelly, hold on. Just give me one second.
 Ooh! One, two, three. 
 One, two three.
 What? What? 
 One, two, three.
 Oh, my God, what? 
 (audience applauds)
 Hi, Frank.  What are you doing here?  (whispers): I came to see you. 
 Oh!
 Frank, is that you? Hey,  come help me out, I'm stuck.  Not now, Deandra.  (audience laughs)  Oh, by the way,  none of the stuff you're doing is playing.  Except for the fart stuff.  What fart stuff?  See? You should have farted after you said that.  Just come help me get out of this thing. 
 Put a fart in, Dennis.
 What?  (farts)  Oh, goddamn it, what's Frank doing over there?  I You know what, I think he's playing the scumbag  who comes in off the street to bang your mom.  Well, I don't want him banging my mom, dude. Shit.  (audience laughs)  Oh! Uh, hi, Frank.  I didn't know, uh, Bonnie was  gonna be having company. I would have put my hands on.  How embarrassing.  Get lost. I'm gonna bang your sister.  You got it.  Goddamn it, dude,  This is gross. I-I don't want this.  Can we turn this into something else? I mean  Well, maybe You know what, maybe we could turn this into,  like, a love triangle thing  between Jack, your mom and Frank?  No, I don't want a love triangle between 
 Well
 I don't want any shape of love between them.  That's just gross.  AUDIENCE: Ooh!  I'll be in the upstairs attic  rooting around if anyone needs me. 
 Yeah, I do. I need you.
 Oh, I'll be up there, Dee. 
 U-Uncle Jack
 Come on, Bonnie. This boner 
 ain't gonna last forever.
 Okay.  (audience laughs, applauds)  Yeah. Goddamn it, though, 
 he's really gonna bang her?
 Yeah.  Did Mac put a camera in my mom's room?  No, I did.  Listen, people it does not matter  how you people try to ruin this thing.  I will make it work, because I'm a genius.  MAC: Now look at the plant!  Look at the plant.  Now look at the globe. Up. Back to the plant.  Can't cut around her when she's in every shot, can you, Dennis? 
 And look at the teddy bear. And the plant.
 Great.  This disgusting bitch is in every shot?  I don't want to stand here no more.  I got to take another dump.  Oh, look, Mom, no more shitting, all right?  Um and when you go, are you not having a full elimination?  I mean, why are you going so much? 
 (audience laughs, cheers)
 Mom?  Mom, where are you?  Don't try and steal focus, Charlie. 
 Charlie, can't breathe.
 What? What?  Help. Help, Charlie.  Get off me, you crazy bitch! (grunts)  Mom, look, no more shitting! 
 Let's go, we got to go where the action is.
 Oh!  Mom! Frank!  Come on, stop banging!  Charlie. What a pleasant surprise.  Get off me, man. Get off! 
 Mom stays in the picture.
 Let's go, come on! 
 Charlie! I only got to third!
 Come on, get out of here.  Go. You can have any woman you want it's got to be my mom?  Hey, come on, what are you doing?  Wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay, Mom,  we got to go where the action is. Come on.  FRANK: God Goddamn it!  I was sliding into home, Charlie. 
 Get out of here, Frank.
 Aw, come on.  Son of a bitch. Get lost! 
 Charlie!
 Aw  I can't breathe. You guys, I'm pretty sure  I'm gonna die in this banister.  Charlie, what's going on?  Look, I'm coming clean. We've been watching you guys, right?  The presents that we brought over they're hidden cameras.  The teddy bear, the globe all that shit.  I don't know how you didn't see it. And then we  turned it into a show. The show was pretty good.  We had chips. But look this all started 'cause you  sent me this in the mail. I got freaked out.  Well, I sent it to you because I missed you, 
 I wanted to see more of you.
    That's all that is? It's not because you feel trapped  in your own home and you guys are fighting too much  or whatever it is?  No. We get along great.  (grumbles)  Oh, but this makes me feel so much better.  Now that I know that you're watching me.  (grumbles)  My mom feels the same way.  And she also says that she loves me 
 and misses me.
 Well, shoot,  all right, well, why don't we bring it on in 
 for a hug, huh?
 Okay!  This was all just one big misunderstanding.  Get off me, dude. Get off. What are you doing? Get off.  (farts)  (laughter)  DENNIS:  Old Lady House   You'll never be alone.   I got to say it: that's the best episode yet. That is! 
 It's a classic!
 Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I love the button at the ending. 
 Yeah?
 Oh, that was the biggest joke 
 in the show. The biggest moment.
 It was, it was.
 DEE: Was it? 
 I mean it, really.
 Oh, well, guys, look, I told you 
 I know my physical comedy.
 Yeah. 
 Right?
 Okay, yeah. 
 Oh!
 Oh!
 What are you doing? 
 What's wrong?
 Hey.  Show's been canceled, guys. 
 What?!
 Wha  I got a four-episode sex arc.  Nah, nah. You know, now-now that everybody knows  they're being filmed, it's more like a reality TV show,  and I just can't enjoy it when the people who are being filmed 
 know they're being filmed.
 Yeah, but what about  our show, man? What about making my mom famous? 
 It's just not funny anymore.
 Oh, oh,  oh, oh I know how to make it funny. (grunts) 
 (farts)
 Oh! 
 What?
 Oh, I  I just shit my pants. 
 Oh, God!
 Oh!
 Oh, God. 
 Oh!
 Oh, God. 
 Oh, Dee.
 That's not funny.  I just meant to fart. I didn't 
 I didn't
 Oh, my God! Without the laugh track 
 that's, like, really horrible.
 Yeah, you're just  a grown woman who shit her pants. 
 (audience laughs)
    Now it's funny again.                     1 FRANK:  Go for it   Go for it   Go   Go for it, go for it, go.   Go for it, go for it, go.   (grunts)  Go for it, go for it, go.   Go for it, go for it.  (coughing sneeze)  Well, somebody's chipper this morning.  Oh you guys were there all this time?  I didn't see you.  Yeah, we just didn't want to interrupt  your morning routine.  Is doing cocaine every morning your routine, Frank? 
 Yeah.
 Hey, Frank,  how's Wolf Cola doing?  Funny you should ask.  I'm selling it to the Jews in Boca Raton.  They're slurping it up  like candy. They're  I'm telling you, they're addicted.  If I recall, Wolf Cola used to just be, like,  a money laundering front.  Well, it was, but I'm selling it now by the truckload.  I mean, they can't get enough of it.  It's become the official drink of Boca Raton.  Why do you ask?  Well, just 'cause of this.  The group released  another video today.          (men shouting)  (automatic gunfire)  Preliminary investigations  have revealed that Wolf Cola may in fact be  an American soda company, although how and why Boko Haram  has adopted it as their official soft drink  is unknown at this time.  We'll keep you updated on this story as it develops.  Boca Raton, Frank?  Or the official soft drink of Boko Haram?  Whoops.    How do you confuse a city in Florida  with a terrorist organization in Africa?  It's an easy misunderstanding.  It is if you're an elderly cokehead,  trying to launder money through a dummy 
 (laughing): soda corporation.
 (laughs)  This is bigger than cola, Dee.  This is gonna touch all of Frank's Fluids.  My God, there are other fluids?  Yeah, Wolf Cola, some Nip boba drink  Fight Milk. 
 Fight Milk?!
 Fight Milk?! 
 Yeah.
 Wait, wait, dude, that's our drink.  You've been selling that?  It's selling like crazy  with the UFC guys. 
 UFC fighters are drinking Fight Milk?
 What?!  Buying it like crazy.  Oh, my God, Charlie, this is huge. 
 Yeah!
 Remember, we designed that  for bodyguards, by bodyguards.  And it makes total sense because the-the best bodyguards 
 are former UFC fighters.
 Well, of course.  And the best UFC fighters are former bodyguards,  so bodyguards, UFC fighters, 
 that's like
 It's a revolving door. 
 Absolutely.
 Of course.  We got to take control of the product.  L-let's get out there.  Let's-let's-let's mingle with these dudes. 
 Let's expand the brand, baby.
 (caws) 
 Fight Milk's back.
 (both cawing) 
 Fight Milk!
 Yeah! Yeah!  Found my go bag.  Dee, come over here and dye my hair blond.  (Dee and Dennis laughing) 
 Go bag?
 You're gonna go blond? 
 (laughs)
 Yeah.  This is not funny.  Oh, no, it's very funny to me, actually,  'cause your life's falling apart.  Yeah, you really screwed yourself this time, Frank.  Hey, do you mind?  Yeah, go ahead. I'm screwed?  You're going down, too, buddy.  (sniffs) What?  Remember when you wanted all the power  so you could get the puss?  I made you executive  vice president of worldwide distribution. 
 Shit, but nobody knows that, right?
 (laughs)  I mean, dude, I only wanted the illusion of power.  The-the illusion.  I never saw an ounce of puss.  Oh, this is a good day for me. 
 You're going down, too? This is great.
 You're laughing?  You're executive vice president of operations. 
 Oh.
 What?  Yes.  Goddamn it, Frank, why would you lump me into this?  It's a family business. I wanted it to be wholesome. 
 Okay, a-all right, all right.
 Oh, no. 
 Don't panic, don't panic, don't panic.
 Oh, no.  I got this, I got this.  We-we just need to face this thing head-on.  And we need to do it right away, okay?  Because we only have  24 hours.  This is why we had to wait  for you to go to Bed Bath & Beyond?  Yes, bitch. Now, listen,  we live in the age of the 24-hour news cycle,  which means we only have  24 hours to respond to this, okay?  If we don't, then Internet trolls  are gonna control the narrative.  I don't know how we're gonna come back  from dealing with terrorists.  Christ, Mercedes built Nazi tanks, okay?  And the Jews are still driving their cars around.  Floyd Mayweather beat the shit  out of multiple women and he's the highest paid  athlete of all time.  All right? There's only one thing  you can't come back from banging kids.  Well, what about the Catholic Church?  Hmm. That's a good point.  Yeah, no, they did sidestep  banging kids pretty masterfully,  but they've got billions of dollars at their disposal 
 and we do not, so
 No.  here we go.  (techno music blares) 
 Fight Milk!
 Fight Milk's in the house.  Fight Milk's in the house. 
 CHARLIE: Who needs some Fight Milk?
 MAC: Fight! Fight!  (both cawing) 
 Fight Milk's in the house.
 That's right.  Time to stop eating your crow  and start drinking your crow, everybody.  MAN: Hey, guys.  Turn off that Cancun,  pussy ass, techno bullshit. 
 Yeah.
 Yeah, that's what I said. 
 I said turn off the
 That's what I was saying is  Don't play the c the  the Cancun bullshit, Charlie, 
 and he said
 I said the same thing, yeah.  Got to go spring break. Well, anyway, 
 let's tell you about ourselves.
 Yeah.  We're the founders and creators of Fight Milk. 
 Yeah.
 We wanted to come by and tell you  a little bit about what we do. 
 Yeah.
 Now, I've always been very passionate 
 about dominating other men.
 Uh-oh.  There's nothing like the feeling  of another man submitting to your will.  Now that's power. 
 Yeah.
 In a lot of ways, that's love.  What are you talking about?  Okay, he's a bodyguard, though. 
 Yeah.
 I feel like you were being unclear. 
 Did-did I not say that?
 Yeah, you should say 
 you should lead with that.
 I'm screwing up the pitch.  You know what, I'm gonna jump in here.  We're-we're a couple of crow enthusiasts  who wanted to take the power 
 and essence of a crow
 (caws)  and-and we packed that into a delicious milk drink 
 that we invented, thus Fight Milk.
 Yeah.  I don't know what you guys are talking about right now,  but I have heard of your stuff  and Cerrone and Felder, they actually love it. 
 Are you kidding me, dude?
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Cowboy Cerrone and Paul Felder drink Fight Milk?  Oh, they love it. They crush it. 
 They crush it.
 They're crushing 
 That's
 Fight Milk  is supposed to be crushed.  Uh, this is for wiping yourself down. 
 Yeah, yeah, thanks, bro.
 Okay, man. 
 All right, yeah, my man.
 All right, thanks, bro.  Yeah, thanks, guys. 
 Hey, good luck with that.
 Oh, yeah, yeah. 
 Hello?
 Hello? 
 Uh, Mr. Cowboy, Mr. Felder.
 (chuckles) 
 Oh, Cowboy!
 Hey! 
 Oh!
 Oh! 
 It's us, the Fight Milk guys.
 Hey.  Oh, man, we love your drink.  We just had some.  Yeah, man, I'd get up and shake your hands  if I wasn't shitting my brains out right now. 
 Oh, no.
 No, no, that's fine, yeah.  (farting)  So, Fight Milk makes you sick?  Makes you expel all body fluids.  Sweat, piss,  and shit; we got these weigh-ins coming up.  Nothing cuts weight like Fight Milk.  Oh, you're using it to cut weight, huh?  Yeah, they should give you guys a Nobel  (farting)  (Felder vomits)  Oh, I just puked on my dick!  Rock and roll.  All right, cool. 
 Well, uh
 Rock and roll, yeah. 
 Yeah.
 We just got you some merch.  Um  CHARLIE: Yeah, water bottle. 
 (coughing, retching, farting)
 For when you feel better, and 
 Um yeah,
 We should, uh  well, keep drinking the-the drinks  that makes you guys throw up and 
 Oh! Oh!
 Oh, God!    All right, you guys ready? This is our opportunity  to control our message to the public.  And I think how we do that is soften their brand. 
 Whose brand?
 Boko Haram. 
 What?
 Wait, stop,  Fr-Frank, you want to change  the perception of a global terrorist organization? 
 Yeah, and I've got many facts to do it.
 No. No, no, no, no.  Put your facts away. We're just here to apologize, bozo.  No, hold on a second, Dee, no. We're not here  to apologize, either, okay? You never apologize.  We're just here to take responsibility,  but for nothing specific.  All that matters is that consumers feel 
 their voices are being heard.
 No.  You say you're sorry, and then you just move on.  No, Dee, actually, you don't say anything.  But you do have a very important job  to say nothing and stand behind me.  You see, audiences are gonna trust me  over you because you're a woman,  and, by definition, shrill.  No. Women identify with women in power.  Oh, no, Dee. Women hate other women in power. 
 I'm threatened by 'em.
 Everyone is.  Now, objectify yourself and humanize me.  Hmm.  (theme music plays)  And here to tell their side of the story  is the team from Wolf Cola.  Guys, thanks for coming in.  Oh, well, thank you for having us, Chet.  We at Wolf Cola were as shocked and saddened  by this news as everyone else.  Uh, this by no means reflects our ideals  as a premium soda company.  We're a family-run business,  and we really care about people's concerns.  Listen, the point is,  we have heard you all,  and we are working tirelessly to remedy this situation.  CHET: Well, not an easy situation,  indeed, but handled with grace and aplomb.  Thank you, Mr. Reynolds. And it looks like  you're already getting good feedback.  Oh, that's-that's great. Well, uh, thank you, Chet.  And I want to say thank you to America  And also, we're sorry.  We accept full responsibility  for this heinous mistake, and please know  that I am actively firing people as we speak,  because I am the boss.  (whispers): Bitch.  That's good to know.  Yes.  Next up, a heroic tale  FRANK: You know what, Chet,  can I say something?  I think we've said enough.  I think you got to understand  that Boko Haram did not do 9/11. 
 Yeah.
 That was al-Qaeda.  Paris, that was done  by ISIS.  Boko Haram is just concentrating,  they're doing Africa. I mean 
 (groans)
 I mean, there's mosquitos down there  that are bigger terrorists than Boko Haram. 
 (theme music plays)
 We're gonna take a break.  And the 24-hour news cycle starts again.  Way to go, assholes. 
 I made good points.
 Jesus Christ,  I am just getting eviscerated online.  People calling me a bitch, flat-chested bitch,  pretty much everybody wanting to rape me.  You opened that door the second you apologized, Dee.  You don't see this? People need an outlet  to unleash their rage. Now social media  will come down on you  with the fury of a middle-aged man  who's accomplished nothing. 
 Hi-yo!
 What's up, bitches?  What's that? What do you got?  Huh? Crow traps, baby. Look.  Fight Milk is boomin'. Apparently,  people are using it to lose weight.  Yeah. Now, we're gonna lean into that new market 
 and rebrand the product.
 Mm-hmm.  I like this rebranding idea.  That's what I got to do I got to rebrand my product.  You guys, the problem is, I just ooze sexuality.  Well, you ooze.  A real woman of power,  she exudes no sexuality at all.  That's true.  I think we got to focus on not losing Boko Haram.  That's a good business. The fastest-growing marketplace  is Muslim extremists.  Frank, we're not going into business with terrorists.  Are you crazy?  Look, we need to get back on TV immediately  and control the goddamn narrative.  Yeah, speaking of TV, we're gonna be doing a little controlling  of our narrative, so you guys mind clearing out?  Yeah, this is now our set.  All right, come on, we got work to do, guys. Let's go.  Let's go. Don't forget your phone, 
 stupid idiot.
 Yep.  (hard rock playing) 
 (caws)
 (caws) 
 Three, two, one! What up!
 What up! 
 Are you fat?
 You probably are, 'cause you're watching TV!  Or Internet. 
  
 (cawing)  Fight Milk! Rebrand!  (caws) 
  
 (cawing)  Let's talk about women's bodies.  I like women.  It's easy for us men we have four  acceptable body types.  Skinny ripped, jack ripped, dad bod,  and fat if you're funny.  It's a landslide!  As we all know, women only have one acceptable body type.  Skinny, big tits!  New evidence is suggesting that all this science  inside one crow's egg  can scientifically make your breasts larger.  Watch the enzymes enlargify your breasts.  (whooshing)  Want to hear more about it? The sci 
 (cawing)
 Aah!  No nerds! Fight Milk!  (cawing)  Finally there's a crow-based  protein alcoholic drink for you.  BOTH: Fight Milk! Fight Milk!  (cawing) 
 Well, what do you guys think?
 I don't get it.  That's 'cause you're a stupid ring girl. 
 It couldn't be any simpler.
 Yeah, look,  take it easy. Basically, we're trying  to expand our product to the world of UFC women,  and look, uh, ring girls are the perfect combo. 
 Really.
 Yeah. I mean, honestly, ladies,  you could afford to lose a few pounds,  maybe in this area 
 Well
 or here.  Really, I mean, between the three of you, we could be opening up  a bakery with all the muffin tops I'm seeing. 
 Yes.
 Now, Fight Milk will help you  lose those unwanted pounds  so you don't have to resort to surgery,  which could cause scarring and make you even less attractive 
 to men than you already are, okay?
 All right. 
 Now, I feel like
 No, no, look, I'm sorry,  my friend has really weird women issues.  I didn't realize he brought a laser pointer.  But the point is, you guys could look even better  if you drank Fight Milk.  We're not into your weird diarrhea drink.  Right. Okay, it's not a diarrhea drink. 
 It's
 You know what, Charlie?  This isn't the dream that I had for Fight Milk.  No! We're not the diarrhea guys. 
 No!
 That's not what I want to be.  It's not for women! It was never made for women!  But it'd be great if women also drank it.  The dream was to create a muscle-up energy drink 
 Yeah.
 that gave you the power to fight like a crow! 
 Yes!
 Men!  Or women. But yes. But definitely 
 crow-power fighting skills.
 Either way, 
 Absolutely.
 I think, dude, we got to get back to the lab.  I think we got to get some more crows.  (theme music plays)  From dog fighting to finding a loving home.  (chuckles): Amazing.  Now, who wouldn't want to adopt a little guy like this?  (chuckling): Well said, Mike.  Great story.  Now a local soda company is back in hot water  with controversial remarks.  Returning to talk about it today is the team from Wolf Cola.  Thank you so much for having us back, Chet. Um,  we at Wolf Cola are not just about making a satisfying soda.  We are about making satisfied customers.  We do acknowledge consumers' concerns.  Yes, but we are not apologizing.  (mutters) 
 Right. Oh.
 Sorry.  I'm just here to humanize him. 
 To support me.
 To-to support him.  Support me.  (clears his throat)  Uh, Chet, we would also like to announce  that for every can of Wolf Cola sold,  a portion of the proceeds will be going to a charity  that supports African people.  FRANK: All Africans,  even the our friends at Boko Haram,  because they are people, too. 
 We don't discriminate.
 Okay, right.  Uh, yeah, look, Chet, if I may  address the public directly? 
 By all means.
 Okay.  Um, I assure you  that we have righted this ship,  and we are taking every step necessary  to address all of your concerns.  We at Wolf Cola hope to be a part  of your family's daily refreshment for years to come.  And we can say that without saying I'm sorry.  CHET: Well, Mr. Reynolds,  it sounds like Wolf Cola has the right man in charge. 
 (sniffing, grunts)
 Yeah. Well, I appreciate that. 
 (laughing): Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
 Whoa.  I thought we were done with the dog segment. 
 What the hell's this?
 Oh. Looks like we got  a lovable little guy loose in the studio here.  Yeah. Can we get him out of here? 
 Great. Thanks.
 Not a dog 
 lover, Mr. Reynolds?
 Yeah.  Well, if you're asking me  if I like wild animals slobbering all over me,  then, yeah, I guess I'm not really a 
 not really a dog lover then.
 Wow. I have  never met a person who does not like dogs before. 
 (laughing): Yeah. Yeah.
 (laughs)  There are plenty of us out there,  uh, Chet. Okay, trust me. We're just afraid to admit it  because we feel like we're gonna be judged by people like you. 
 Well, let's take a break.
 You know what? Actually, I'm not done. 
 Uh, Chet, are you a vegetarian by any chance?
 No.  Oh, so you're a hypocrite. Yeah.  See, I find that most people that are whining  about dog fights are actually the same people  going to football games and UFC fights,  watching human beings beat the ever-loving shit  out of each other while eating, uh, fried chicken.  So, wait. Are you saying you're an animal rights activist?  No, I'm actually the opposite, pal.  I can't imagine a bigger waste of peoples' time and energy.  I mean, Chet, if you can eat fried chicken, then  I should be able to eat me some fried dog.  Know what I'm saying? I should be able to eat a bucket  of fried dog at a chicken fight. (laughs)  Yeah. All I'm saying is,  look, let's just, you know, let's be consistent.  (cawing)  (laughing)  MAC: How you feeling, boys? You've been pounding 
 that new formula?
 Yeah, I see you doing it.  Yeah, and we're not doing so good, asshole,  'cause nothing's coming out of me.  My trash can's empty.  Yeah, we're scared to shit we ain't gonna make weight. 
 MAC: Oh, guys.
 Guys, just don't worry. 
 Yeah, yeah, don't worry.
 No, guys, guys, guys.  Don't worry. Okay, look, this is all a part  of our two-step process, all right?  See, right now, you're crow loading  Yeah, you drank about, like,  four or five entire crows  'cause I'm grinding one up for every bottle at this point.  Yes, and it is that crow enzyme that's jacking you up,  and that's why you look so beefy and so handsome.  And All right, but then what's gonna happen is, you start drinking  the Fight Milk Classic, right,  and-and that's gonna make you really sick,  'cause that's just the crow eggs  and some of the crow's fecal matter.  So you start to puke everything out,  and then you'll be fine for the weigh-in.  You're gonna be puking on your dick in no time.  Yeah, yeah, that one's real nasty. Don't worry about it. 
 Yeah.
 You're gonna make weight at the weigh-in.  Yeah, all I know is, we don't make weight,  I'm killing you both.  Yeah. 
 All right.
 MAC: Uh, that's fine.  We're gonna be We're good. 
 Yeah. Yeah.
 All right, guys, hey, go go kick ass.  Remember, that's the nasty one. Drink that one.  That one's got a real    All right,  let's bring out the first fighter, Cub Swanson.  (applause and cheering) 
 We got to get him on Fight Milk, man.
 Oh, yeah, we got to get him.  We got to get him. We got to get him drinking it.  Up next, the challenger, Donald "Cowboy" Cerrone.  (applause and cheering, energetic music playing) 
 Come on!
 (cheering) 
 Yes!
 (whooping)  This is it. If he makes weight,  this is gonna change Fight Milk and our lives forever.  I know, but if he doesn't, we're bolting, right?  Oh, yeah. I've already scoped out every single exit. 
 (crowd chanting)
 155.  (applause and cheering)  Yes!  MAC: Yeah. We did it! 
 We're gonna be rich!
 We did it! We're gonna be rich! 
 We're gonna be rich.
 Let's go.  All right, Cowboy, how you feeling right now?  I'm feeling good. Ready to put on a show for all these guys.  (Mac and Charlie cawing)  What the hell is going on? Who are these guys?  Uh, just like to take the opportunity to thank Fight Milk.  Yes, and thank you, Cowboy, and thank you, Megan.  We'd also like to take this opportunity  to announce that Fight Milk is now 
 the official drink of the UFC.
 Official drink.  Now if you're in 
 (microphone feedback)
 No, no.  This is not the official drink of the UFC.  And I don't know who these guys are. 
 Security, get these assholes out of here!
 Fight Milk!  BOTH: Fight Milk! Fight Milk!  AUDIENCE: Fight Milk! Fight Milk! Fight Milk!  Fight Milk! Fight Milk!  MAN (on TV): The nationwide hatred for Wolf Cola  continues to intensify on an hourly basis  Holy shit. We're getting hammered worse than before.  Bye-bye, Frank's Fluids.  Turns out there are two things that can't be forgiven  raping children and disliking dogs.  CHARLIE: Well, what am I gonna do with all the merchandise, man?  Throw it in the garbage, burn it. Who gives a shit.  Yeah, we're done. Fight Milk shit the bed. 
 What happened?
 CHET (on TV): Breaking news  from the sports world.  Fighters at a UFC  event in Philly tested positive  for several banned substances,  stemming from an energy drink called Fight Milk.  We pumped it full of human growth hormone, you know.  Yeah.  I mean, just nothing else was working.  It just it was just giving people diarrhea. 
 Mm.
 Ugh.  Starting to become known  as the official drink of the UFC,  this Fight Milk is a serious smudge for the group,  and a potential public relations nightmare. 
 Ooh.
 Holy shit. Holy shit. 
 What?
 You guys, this is good.  This is good. We're freed, and they are screwed.  See, this is actually the one good thing  about the 24-hour news cycle.  If you give it enough time, something new will come along  to replace peoples' old outrage with new outrage.  Not much is known about Fight Milk,  except that it's made right here in Philadelphia  by a parent company known as Frank's Fluids.  Goddamn it!  (sighs)  Start the clock.  Yeah.                     1 DENNIS: All right.  Uh, let's get started.  (clears throat) What do you guys want to know?    NARRATOR: The circumstances surrounding the death of  the woman born Maureen Ponderosa  captivated South Philadelphia.  (indistinct police radio chatter)  She was discovered in an alley with a broken neck.  In 2013, Maureen had begun 
 her transition to a cat.
 (cat mews)  And in her cat form, she went by the name Bastet  to honor the Egyptian god of cats.  (cat yowls)  The story quickly became fodder for local media.  So much for having nine lives.  This cat did not land on her feet.  She landed on her neck.  NARRATOR: Authorities soon focused  on the suspicious nature of her death.  GIRARD: My name is Lance Girard.  I've been with the Philadelphia Police Department for 24 years,  12 of which were with the Homicide division.  I've seen a lot of things.  A man wants to turn himself into a woman?  Okay. Who am I to judge?  But, really, a cat?  What's next? A watermelon?  (camera clicks)  First thing we wanted to establish is  to whether the deceased was acting strange.  Not like "I'm turning myself into a cat" strange.  More like suicide strange.  We learned that she was excited about an upcoming surgery,  a, uh, reverse nipplectomy.  That's where they add more nipples.  (cat meows)  I guess  I don't know she wanted more nipples.  The thought of that just makes me want to blow my lunch.  Now, apparently, the ex-husband was on the hook  for this surgery due to an alimony arrangement.  He wasn't happy about it.  That's when he became our primary suspect.  DENNIS: Was I irritated by this?  Yeah, of course I was.  I mean, it was the most expensive procedure yet.  You know, but I-I remained supportive  and, uh, kept my cool.  And I never threatened her in any way.  Now, due to the nature of this call,  we decided to bring him in for questioning.  (indistinct police radio chatter)  And he cooperated.  Said he wanted to clear his name.  GIRARD: He answered every question.  Even offered DNA samples.  Although he did request to draw his own blood,  which is kind of strange.  Mr. Reynolds was forthright.  Charming, quite frankly.  GIRARD: It wasn't until I reviewed  the interrogation footage later that I saw it.  Something very unsettling.  24 years on the job,  I'd never seen anything like it.  Two hours.  Never moved.  Never blinked.  Gives me goose bumps just thinking about it.  He had all the right answers,  but my gut told me this guy was guilty.  Of something.  Did I kill Maureen? No.  Am I glad she's dead? Sure.  NARRATOR: Maureen's family was convinced of Dennis's guilt.  (snorts) Maureen?  Maureen died three years ago.  Dennis killed Bastet, all right?  And let me tell you something. He did us all a favor.  You ever seen a grown woman take a dump in a sandbox?  NARRATOR: Despite conjecture, the question still remained:  Was there anything in Dennis Reynolds' past  that would suggest him capable of murder?  Testing. Testing.  Syphilis. Syphilis. (laughs)  That's Well, yeah  Well, he kind of  snapped the neck, uh, off a crow one time a little bit.  But that but that's not  not normal right, you know?  (laughs) I mean, it was just like boys  being boys. Yeah. That  Look, we had a totally normal childhood, and  Look, Dennis wouldn't hurt a fly. No way.  FRANK: Whatever Deandra says is BS.  She's probably just covering for him  because she's afraid he's gonna snap her neck like that crow. 
 (crow cawing)
 DEE: He didn't just snap it.  He broke the thing's head clean off. 
 It was gruesome.
 (snap)  I still have nightmares about it.  And I'm old.  She told you what?  No, no, no, no. No, no.  Look that crow was injured,  and I was simply putting it out of its misery,  while, yes, testing the tensile strength of a crow's neck.  Well, yes, there was another crow,  but that's because I simply couldn't believe  that a crow's neck could be that weak.  Well, yes, there was a third crow,  and a fourth, if you must know, but who likes crows?  FRANK: Look, if you can kill a crow, you can kill a cat. 
 (crow cawing)
 (echoing): Cat, cat, cat  That's why I started recording all our conversations.  I suspected Frank was probably recording  all of our conversations, because of course he would.  But let me tell you something,  he was no fan of Maureen's, either.  He was just trying to deflect attention,  which is why I started recording  all of our conversations as well.  I could have worn a goddamn IMAX camera around my neck  and he wouldn't have noticed.  The old bitch.  And I caught him saying some pretty troubling stuff.  What are we watching here?  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Cats, cats.  Is that me?  Cats. I'll tell you what to do with cats.  Who shot this thing? Dennis?  Here's what you do with cats.  Back in the sweatshop in 'Nam, we found a cat,  we tossed it right in the soup.  Those hungry bastards ate cat soup every day.  What's the worst thing that could happen?  Some little kid choke on a hairball and die.  So then you toss him in the soup.  I was making money hand over foot, literally.  Somebody lost a hand or a foot, I'd toss it in the soup.  (burps)  Well, that's all a lie.  (burps)  Uh, there was no soup.  (burps)  Nope.  There's no sweatshop.  (muffled burping)  Excuse me. I got to go to the can.  (static crackling)  NARRATOR: Investigators wanted to verify the timeline  Dennis provided to authorities.  DENNIS: Like I told the police, uh,  Mac and I were watching a movie back at the apartment,  and then I went to the bar.  That's true. We were watching Operation Dumbo Drop.  We were doing this amazing thing that I came up with,  where we watch an old movie,  and then I turn the volume down really low  and we make wiseacre remarks the entire time.  Yeah, he didn't come up with it.  It's just Mystery Science Theater 3000. 
 It's a spin on that.
 It's exactly that. 
 Well, there's no robots.
 So it's worse.  Oh, come on, Dennis. It's funny.  It-It's not funny. It's not funny at all,  because you can never think of jokes on the fly.  H-He, like, pauses the movie  to try and think of something funny to say,  and then he never can think of anything funny,  so he ends up just saying a line from Borat or Austin Powers.  It's super annoying and played-out, and it's not funny.  Well, uh, like this. "Get in my belly."  But you're never referring to anything when you say it.  "Yeah, baby. Get in my belly."  Well, that's two different characters. 
 That's Mike Myers.
 It's not Mike Myers.  It's it's multiple characters  that Mike Myers plays in-in the same movie.  Multiple characters in the same movie?  What is he, a wizard?  Look, it's funny, Dennis.  It's not funny.  Are we done with this? Can we be done?  I'm tired of saying the same things over and over again.  Well, wait. Wh hold Dennis, d-don't leave without me.  I mean, dude, look, are you mad at me?  NARRATOR: Investigators could find no discrepancies  in the timeline.  But then  a twist.  He totally could have done it.  Now, supposably, Dennis didn't see Maureen that night,  but remember that Maureen was once Dennis's  (imitates Borat): "Wife. Very nice."  That was Borat.  It was Friday, payday.  Maureen always came into Paddy's  to pick up her alimony check, ASAP.  NARRATOR: To avoid confusion, it should be pointed out  that in a bizarre twist,  Deandra Reynolds refused to be a part of this documentary  unless we allowed her to play Maureen  in the reenactment.  (cat meows)  MAC: And Dennis always made a big show  of getting her with the spray bottle.  You know, because cats hate water.  (cat yowling)  So, you see, Dennis totally saw Maureen that night.  Charlie was there.  Why hasn't he spoken up?  Probably because Dennis  intimidated him.  Oh, I just thought it'd be more dramatic if I  Oh, come on, come on. I didn't lie.  I just left out some facts that are insignificant.  And-and intimidate Charlie? Please. What am I gonna do?  Call him on the phone and threaten him?  No, I know. But, I mean, if Mac's gonna do it,  then, you know, I'm gonna do it.  (bell clanging)  (chuckles)  At this point in the interrogation,  Christ, I was at a loss.  NARRATOR: Further inspection of Dennis Reynolds' safe 
 revealed a cache of suspicious items.
 (siren wailing)  DENNIS: Awesome.  NARRATOR: So while Mr. Kelly's statements  were clearly unreliable and would need to be thrown out,  another breakthrough came:  autopsy results came back from the lab.  Um  Look, is getting groomed like a cat by your ex weird?  Yep.  Is it illegal?  (chuckles) I wish.  NARRATOR: The investigation was at a crossroads.  Then another massive break.  FRANK: Dennis has an answer for everything.  Well, answer me this:  Where's the collar?  (camera clicks) 
 (cat meows)
 Cats have collars.  Maureen's body  didn't have a collar on it.  Killers keep trophies.  Alls I'm saying,  find the collar, find the killer.  NARRATOR: This is not the first time the collar came up.  Dee Reynolds had, oddly,  made the collar an issue during filming.  DEE: Hey. Stop!  Stop! Stop with the squirting! Stop! Cool it!  We said one spray and then my line.  I It was in my contract that we talked  I put one squirt in there for on purpose.  And this collar! I Th-There's something wrong  with the collar. It's driving me nuts.  It is an actual flea collar?  You son of a bitch.  I-I really think the water activated  some kind of, like, chemical agent. My-my neck's burning.  NARRATOR: Was the flea collar actually burning her,  as she claimed?  Are you serious?  Yes, asshole! It was burning my skin!  You want to zoom in on this?!  NARRATOR: Hard to say.  But maybe there was another reason she removed it.  FRANK: Whatever Deandra says is BS.  She's probably just covering for him because she's afraid  he's gonna snap her neck like that crow.  (crow caws)  NARRATOR: Maybe Deandra didn't want to wear the collar  in order to cover for her brother  and to establish that Maureen never wore a collar at all.  We then discovered something in this piece of footage  that blew the doors wide open on this case.  Was I a person of interest?  Yeah.  I am an interesting person.  But at the end of the day, you know,  I'm just some guy with a crazy ex-wife  who fell off of a roof pretending to be a cat.  That's the end of it.  All my stories checked out.  I was cleared. Case closed.  FRANK: Find the collar, find the killer.  Find the collar, find the killer.  DENNIS: 'cause a dog is who I am now!  WRESTLING ANNOUNCER: hit the referee!  FRANK: Find the collar  MAC (imitates Borat): "Very nice."  FRANK: Find the collar, find the killer.    Guys, this was an open-and-shut case that was shut months ago.  And Maureen never wore a collar. You guys put that there.  Well, yeah, we needed a big twist at the end  to show that you're guilty.  But I'm-I'm not guilty.  What about the security footage of Maureen's death?  I mean, it shows her prancing around on the roof  like an asshole, and then she just falls off.  CHARLIE: People don't want to see that,  because it's hard evidence, 
 you know what I mean?
 Yeah.  CHARLIE: Like, it's better to actually sit on that footage  until, like, maybe episode ten, and then let people  decide then if you're guilty or not.  Ten episo You're gonna do ten episodes of this?  Yeah, but then even then we would keep it vague.  I mean, 'cause that's entertainment, you know?  Someone gets murdered, and then you make a show.  But you never give any actual answers, 
 because that's what people love.
 No.  You drag it out. You rake it all over the victim's family.  It's sort of like eating a bag of chips, you know?  It's never gonna actually make you full,  and at the end you're sick,  but you want to go back for more.  You want more chips. 
 Murder is chips.
 Okay,  you know what, I don't know what you guys are talking about,  but I'm gonna find these tapes, and I'm gonna destroy them.  Well, we have backups, so it 
 Yeah.
 Oh, you know what?  That could make a good episode, where he's destroying  Let's think about that, right? He's destroying the tapes  MAC: You know what,  that would be  (imitates Borat): "very nice."  (Mac and Charlie laughing)  Is that Borat?  Yes! See?  He gets it. He's laughing. 
 Yeah, 'cause I know he was doing an impression.
 He's laughing.  Okay, wait, uh, let me let me think of another one.  Let me think of another one. "I'll be back."  CHARLIE: Oh (stammers) Who is that? Who is that?   (trio chanting backwards)                         1 (whistling a tune)  What's going on with you, man?  Are you limping?  Uh, no, I've just been working out  on this new exercise bike I got, 
 and my glutes are, like, so sore.
 Yeah. 
 CHARLIE: Know what it is?
 (whistles) Oh. 
 MAC: Yeah, big-time, big-time.
 Howdy. 
 Hi.
 It's it's very windy today, isn't it?  Yeah.  Oh, man, look at this.  Dog shit.  Did you just step in that on purpose?  Oh, no, I just you know, I didn't really see it.  You pointed it out to me!  And then you stepped directly in it. 
 Since when do you read?
 What? Nothing. No.  (laughs): Books are stupid.  I don't. I was just (groans)  It wasn't like, I didn't time it out. 
 I mean, why would I do that?
 I have no idea. 
 Why are you still standing in it?
 It was just an accident, man.  People step in dog shit accidentally all the time.  Is that a lottery scratcher?  Sometimes it's in, 
 sometimes it's out.
 Are those mirrors? 
 No.
 You creep.  (grunting)  Look out, faggot!  BOTH: Holy shit.  God! 
 (coughing)
 Are you okay?  (sighs)  Hey, Frank, what the hell was that?  What? I saved your life.  But you called me the "F" word.  So what? I'm a hero.  You used a slur, dude.  That's like a hate crime.  DENNIS: Yeah, that's hateful speech, man. 
 DEE: You really can't
 Yeah, but he saved his life.  Yeah, but you can't say that word anymore.  So, which is it?   
 MAC: You are entitled to nothing!
 (indistinct arguing)  Listen, motion to present  articles of confederation. 
 Motion denied.
 Oh  Shut up, bitch. You don't deserve anything.  Excuse me. Hey. Can I help you?  Okay, look, well, usually, we're a pretty reasonable crew. 
 Yeah, right? I mean
 Yeah.  we have our differences, but we settle them in house. 
 Sure.
 We have a good process.  There's filibusters, the whole thing. 
 No.
 This one's a doozy. 
 Yeah, this one we can't do in-house.
 We can't we can't  That's why I wanted to bring in a third party.  Someone to hear us out and deliver a final verdict. 
 That's you, guy.
 Yeah, that's you.  CHARLIE: That's you.  Because a great injustice has occurred, okay?  Frank committed a hate crime.  I saved your life. 
 But you used a slur!
 It was a slur. 
 That's
 You'd be dead if I didn't!  Okay, okay, I think I'm getting it.  You want me to figure out whether or not  a hate crime's been committed?  What? 
 No.
 FRANK: No, no, no, no. 
 Way off. Way off.
 No, no, no, no, no.  DEE: Oh, no, but, no, it's not about that at all.  Yeah, it's about this.  A two-dollar scratcher lottery ticket. 
 Mm-hmm.
 Yeah.  Y-You've hired an arbitration attorney  to figure out which of you is entitled  to a two-dollar scratcher? 
 Now you're getting it.
 Me. 
 He's getting it.
 Now he gets it.  DENNIS: The thing is, each one of us feels that we're entitled  to that ticket, and we need you 
 to tell us who it belongs to.
 Yeah.  Why don't you scratch it and see if it's worthless,  and then you wouldn't have to go through all of this? 
 Okay, so he's not getting it.
 What?! 
 Is he serious?
 Do you not want a job?  Hold on. Is it Phil? Is your name Phil? 
 Yeah, Phil, yeah.
 It is Phil?  It's Phil.  This ticket represents hope, okay?  Potential yeah?  Promise.  The very foundation upon which this group rests, eh? 
 CHARLIE: Yes.
 MAC: And that hope  belongs to me.  It belongs to me, you son of a bitch!  (overlapping arguing)  Please, stop.  Each of you will have an opportunity to plead your case.  The only rule I have is that you each treat each other  with respect and common courtesy.  Do we all agree to those terms?  Well, we would like to thank you so much  for taking our case so last-minute.  The other guy was not our style.  Well, I'm very happy to do so.  I do have a few questions. 
 Fire away.
 DEE: Yup.
 DENNIS: Of course, yeah.  Now, the ticket in question, uh, who purchased it? 
 Me! Thank you.
 Well  That was me, and that's why 
 this whole thing is so cut and dry.
 FRANK: It's  Hold on. I purchased the ticket,  and therefore the ticket belongs to me.  I actually bought the ticket a couple of weeks ago.  But I didn't realize it was gonna be so goddamn blustery 
 that afternoon.
 (wind whistling)  And as I was putting my book into my purse,  the ticket flew out and landed on the ground.  So, you purchased the ticket two weeks ago.  I did.  And why hadn't you scratched the ticket yet?  Oh well, that's because  nobody ever wins those tickets, right?  But as long as you don't scratch it,  then you're not a loser.  You know, in fact, you're a winner.  Potentially. 
 DENNIS: God, Dee
 That is so sad! 
 It's so pathetic.
 What are 
 It is pathetic.
 So sad.  What are you talking You just said  this exact same thing, like, ten minutes ago,  talking about how the ticket  represented hope and all that bullshit.  Somehow coming from you, it just came off so sad.  Well, hold on a second. Motion for sub-arbitration  to determine whether or not that's sad.  Motion accepted. All in favor?  OTHERS: Aye.  Motion passed. It's sad, Dee.  I'd also like to point out  that while Dee's version is the truth,  it's not the whole truth.  Why don't we talk about the contents of Dee's purse?  The scratcher ticket, the candy sour worms,  the pack of cigarettes.  Now, what I want to know is  how can a woman who makes less than minimum wage  afford such impulse buys?  So, you're smoking now, Dee?  FRANK: Is this about your weight?  Because if it is, you're already too bony.  No, I don't think so. I mean, I think you're  getting pretty tubby in the midsection area. 
 What?
 Like a bird.  No, no, that's fine.  Her hands are becoming a major problem for me though.  I have Parkinson's disease.  What?  Well, at least I have a 46% chance  of getting Parkinson's disease, according to a DNA test I took.  The medical journal was because I'm trying to learn  as much as I can about this, you know?  And, you guys, according to that,  smoking can reduce your risk of  Oh, my God, who gives a shit?! 
 What?
 Dee, this isn't about whether or not  you have some horrific neurological disease  or whether or not your hands are the right size.  They are, by the way, but your elbows are a mess.  They're too sharp.  I don't like it. They're stabbing me. 
 That's what it is.
 You got it.  That's not the point, that's not the point.  The point is: how can you actually afford to smoke?  You see, Dee and I had a deal.  I give her money for coffee  every morning on the way to work.  And she's instructed to give  a very generous tip to the cashier, Cassie.  "This is from my boss, Dennis."  Now, this establishes both generosity and authority.  Possibly a little dominance.  It's all a very choreographed dance  between two soon-to-be lovers. 
 Ah
 (Dennis chuckles)  Cassie's underage. 
 (both groan)
 DENNIS: No, no, no, what-what?  What are you talking about?  Cassie is not underage.  Cassie is 21 years old.  So, the champagne I was purchasing  was to celebrate her legal drinking status.  And to honor her full maturity.  (cork pops)  You see, I was waiting for Cassie to mature.  You know, much like an IRA.  Y-You put the money in, then you wait.  And then you make a hefty withdrawal.  (both groaning)  DENNIS: Okay, yeah, sure.  Before full maturity, yeah, ew.  Yeah, but weren't you just saying  that you were doing deposits before maturity?  Uh, no, no, no, no. See, that's where you're wrong.  No, I was, uh, between the ages of 18 and 21,  simply making investments.  But not for early deposits?  Well, deposits are part of the withdrawal.  Sometimes I can't make a deposit at all. 
 (both groaning)
 DENNIS: Ugh, come on, man.  Just  Okay, just to be clear:  a deposit's a load, right? 
 Yeah.
 Well, yeah, yeah.  That's not what I'm talking about.  No, it's a totally different 
 Are you sure?
 DENNIS: No, with my no.  Look, not in this particular case, it's not a lo  It's-it's  Yeah, it's a load. 
 Yeah. I mean, yeah.
 But that's not the point!  That's not the point! The point is:  Dee has no rightful claim to that ticket,  and I'll prove it.  You see, yesterday,  after noticing the contents of her purse,  I decided to follow her this morning.  Cassie never gets her tip,  does she, Dee?  No. Because I refuse to tip for coffee. 
 I think it's dumb.
 DENNIS: Uh-huh.  So if you were buying circus peanuts  and candy sour worms and cigarettes,  I think we all know what that means  about the ticket in question, don't we?  I don't. Do you know? 
 No.
 Totally lost.  That means she bought it with my money!  So, technically, that ticket is mine!  Okay, okay, okay.  Now, let me sum up the facts thus far.  Miss Reynolds bought the ticket  with Mr. Reynolds' money.  But Mr. MacDonald currently possesses it.  Correct. But I deserve it, and here's why.  There we were, right?  We were just walking down the street,  minding our own business.  I'd just spotted the perfect pile of dog shit,  and naturally I stepped in it. 
 What?
 FRANK: Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Okay, I'm a little confused.  Why would you voluntarily step into the dog feces? 
 Well, I didn't, really
 You just said you did. 
 DEE: You said naturally you did
 And we all watched you do it.  CHARLIE: All right, fine.  I voluntarily stepped in the dog shit  so that I would smell of dog shit. Happy? 
 Less happy.
 Why would it make me happy?  I was trying to cover up the smell  of the skunk that I let spray me  so that there would be no questions. 
 Well, now I have more questions.
 Of course you do.  Like: why did you let a skunk spray you? 
 To cover the smell of cologne, man.
 DENNIS: Oh, man. You know what?  Go to the beginning. Go to the first smell!  The first smell that begat all the other smells!  The first smell was cigarettes! I've been smoking with Dee!  All right? Fine, I said it.  Oh. Oh, okay. So, right.  So you thought we would care about the smell of cigarettes, 
 but not the smell of skunk or dog shit.
 Mm. Mm-hmm.  Well, it doesn't matter anyway, all right,  because I deserve the ticket.  Because if the shit shoe's a matcher,  Charlie gets the scratcher! 
 Oh shit.
 What the shit?
 MAC: Come on.  That shirt reeks! 
 Is that what that smell was?
 Yeah.  I thought it was just him.  It does smell; it smells very bad.  But give me a cigarette; I'll cover it up.  But, look, if it smells like shit, you must acquit.  You know what? If everyone's gonna be smoking on my dime  Look, nobody is debating whether or not  the shoe print is yours.  We all know that it is,  because everybody saw you kick me.  We're debating whether or not you actually saved my life.  Which you did not, because I was just about to do 
 a sweet backflip to safety when you
 Oh, bullshit.  He's never once flipped! 
 Here we go.
 I do flips all the time. 
 CHARLIE: You have never once flipped.
 MAC: In the pool?  Which you would not have done  had I not warned you, thereby saving your life!  That is my ticket.  Oh  Ridiculous. "Backflip."  FRANK: There I was, minding my own business,  bird watching.  Beautiful day, isn't it?  It's really gorgeous and  Are those mirrors? 
 No.
 You creep.  He wasn't really bird watching,  he was looking up women's skirts. 
 He peeps on women.
 That's his move.  He's disgusting.  FRANK: Like I said, bird watching.  Not you.  Now, the point is that I said,  "Look out, faggot,"  which were the words that saved Mac's life.  Thereby, I am entitled to at least half that ticket.  Well, why did you use the slur  instead of just yelling your friend's name?  Well, there was a lot going on.  I needed something that would cut through.  Well, as soon as I said the slur,  everybody knew to look at Mac.  FRANK: Look out, faggot!  Mac knew to look.  Dennis and Dee knew to look.  Charlie, who kicked him in the chest,  knew to look.  Hell, even the little kid with the balloon  knew where to look.  Okay, it may have been effective,  but it was an offensive slur.  And a bigot should not be entitled to a hero's payout.  You're allowed to use any language you want  to save somebody's life. 
 Really? Any language?
 FRANK: Yes. 
 You gonna let a man die over a word?
 Yeah, yeah.  I mean, come on. It's just a word.  "Just a word." Oh. Okay.  Well, Frank, tell me something:  If you were going to save somebody else's life,  you know, from a falling piano, and you needed a word to just 
 to just cut right through
 FRANK: Mm-hmm.  what word would you use to call out to the arbiter?  Uh  I suppose  Yeah, you know what? We're, uh, we're treading 
 on some dangerous territory here, buddy.
 Yeah.  "Nigger"?  DENNIS: Oh! Whoa, whoa! 
 CHARLIE: What, what?
 Charlie, you can't use that word.  I'm trying to guess the word that he was saying 
 that he thought Frank was gonna say.
 No, you don't say that ever. 
 I was not using the word.
 DEE: Don't ever that's not  You can't use that word, buddy.  And yet, we've just sort of been  casually throwing the F-word around  willy-nilly for the past few days,  and that hasn't been a problem?  Well, yeah, Mac, because the there's a very dark history 
 associated with the N-word.
 Yeah.  Did you know that a faggot is a burning bundle of sticks  on top of which they used to burn homosexuals?  So, basically, when you call someone a "faggot,"  you are saying that they should be burned at the stake.  Is that right? That's, uh 
 Yes.
 That's pretty dark, yeah, that's dark. 
 That's pretty dark.
 CHARLIE: Yeah, yeah.  Well, maybe there are a few words 
 that we shouldn't be throwing around.
 Yep. 
 Yeah.
 Yeah. 
 What about "cunt"?
 Oh!  We can't lose that! 
 Yeah, it's a good word.
 What?  That's tough. It's a great word.  And it's just not offensive.  CHARLIE: Especially, uh, directed towards 
 a woman when you're trying to insult her.
 (men laughing)  When you're trying to make a woman feel small.  That's extremely offensive!  Come on, you could yell "penis" at me,  and I'd be fine with it. Well, all right, fine.  Well, then, we're gonna take away your favorite word. 
 Yeah.
 Yeah. 
 What, "cocksucker"?
 Yeah.
 Yeah.  What's wrong with that?  You can't say "cocksucker" if we can't say "cunt."  I find it offensive that the idea  of sucking cocks is offensive.  Exactly. There's nothing offensive about sucking cock.  Half the population loves to suck cock.  The other half of the population,  they love getting their cock sucked.  It's kind of a win-win.  We're getting off the point, okay?  In terms of the ticket, I'm calling bullshit on Frank,  because, for some reason, he thinks that I'm gay,  and that is why he called me the F-word,  which makes him a bigot.  Oh, wait.  Uh, catch me up here.  Now, you're not gay?  Obviously not.  FAITH: Okay. Interesting.  So, Mr. Reynolds, um, simply,  was just trying to disrespect you.  He wasn't trying to make a comment  about your sexual orientation?  No, well, see, here's where things get just a little bit  tricky, because Frank thinks Mac is gay because 
 Mac is gay.
 CHARLIE: Yeah.  What?! What-what are you talking about?  Enough with this. 
 This is boring.
 I mean, he's into the closet, 
 he's out of the closet.
 CHARLIE: Yeah, yeah.  We don't like you either way.  Oh, look, now, I care about my body.  So now they become, like, obsessed with me being gay.  Obsessed? We don't care! We're the ones who don't care.  Okay. All right, hold on.  Dee, let me just let me put this to bed.  Okay, Mac, we're in support of it.  So, just come on out of the closet 
 and be done with it.
 You'll feel better. 
 You'll feel better.
 FRANK: Come on.  I honestly have no idea what you're talking about. 
 Mac, Mac
 (others sighing)  (sighs)  We found the bike.  Yeah, so?  The bike in the basement?  What about it?  Oh, Mac.  Mac, 
 don't make me go get the bike.
 Oh.  I've got nothing to hide.  Just, uh, go get the bike.  I'm-a go get the bike.  I would like to present into evidence, uh    Mac's bike.  What? It's an awesome workout bike.  What's the big deal?  (softly): Okay.  Mac, why don't you go ahead and operate the bike.  MAC: Yeah.  Sure.  No problem. Just-just like any other workout bike.  Well  You pedal 
 (all groaning)
 Uh, there you go.  DENNIS: Outrageous.  Yeah, there it is.  I mean, it's just the craziest  All right, all right, all right.  Okay, I (sighs)  I know what you're thinking, okay?  But it is not what it looks like.  DEE: Yeah, what it looks like  is that you are fucking yourself with a dildo bike.  I mean, you got the bike shorts  with the slits in them, in the  Oh, the-the ones in the back? That's for air flow.  This is grotesque.  MAC: No, you're not understanding.  I modded out a regular workout bike,  to create the optimal workout. 
 And added a penis.
 Yeah.  Oh I see. (chuckles)  I see where you guys are getting off the rails.  That's not a penis.  ALL: Oh. 
 It's a fist.
 (Faith gasps)  Uh  I call it the Ass Pounder 4000. 
 And it works like this.
 Uh, no  Imagine you're riding up a steep hill,  and you've already been working super hard,  and you're sweating and you're tired.  What do you do when you're tired? You want to rest.  You go to sit down,  it pushes you right back up in your workout.  The Ass Pounder 4000 will never let you rest. 
 Yeah, see?
 DENNIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah, we got it. 
 MAC: That's the way it works.
 We got it.  Now, I even have an amazing tagline.  "The Ass Pounder: Never stop pumping."  (exhales)  Well, um  think we've seen enough.  I've certainly learned something.  This this has nothing to do with being gay.  This is just the work of a man who's  an extreme sexual deviant.  Gay or not. 
 Can I have one of those?
 MAC: Yeah, whatever, 
 Yeah, whatever, dude.
 Oh, whatever.  You know, you guys are just jealous because I've got  a million-dollar idea and I've got the ticket.  You don't have the ticket yet, bitch!  I bought the ticket.  What are you talking about?! Are you crazy?!  (overlapping arguing)  Quiet! Quiet!  Quiet!  Now, I've heard from everybody involved,  and I will make my decision.  But let me make one thing clear.  In order for this to be entirely just,  I will make my decision based on fairness and compromise.  You understand?  Okay, I think I'm all caught up. 
 All right, so what's the verdict?
 Yeah, what do you got?  I think it's actually pretty straightforward.  Mr. MacDonald is in possession of the ticket,  so he has ownership.  However, he would not be  in possession if his life were not saved by Mr. Reynolds,  who set off the chain of events saving him.  So I see it as a 50/50 split. 
 (groaning)
 Are you kidding me?
 I'm a hero! 
 Oh! You bitch!
 50/50 split? 
 out of the way!
 DENNIS: Nothing for the man 
 who paid for the ticket?
 I bought it!  And this bigot here is gonna get a hero's payout?  He may be a bigot and he did use disgusting speech,  but it's not technically  hate speech since Mr. MacDonald does not claim to be gay.  Oh.  Oh, does that mean if I claim to be gay, I get all of it?  Well, um, y-yes.  You would be entitled to keep all of it.  I claim to be gay! 
 No!
 No, no, no, no.  Now you're gay?  There's a history behind it.  I've been gay forever.  Everybody knows it. Even the balloon kid knew it.  Soon as he gets that ticket, he's going back in the closet. 
 Yeah. This isn't fair.
 Mark my words.  If he's gonna do it, he's got to stay out,  which he won't, I guarantee you.  Fine. Whatever. Yeah. I'm out!  Totally out. I'm gonna  Hey, uh, excuse me, would you please do the honors  on my ticket, please? 
 It's probably worthless.
 MARGIE: Okay. Sure.  Let's, uh let's see what we have here.  Okay.  Wow.  What? 
 What is it?
 Well, you're a winner.  What? How much?  $10,000. 
 CHARLIE: What?!
 (all exclaiming) 
 No! No!
 Oh, my God!  Gay Mac rules! 
 Bullshit!
 Gay-gay, rich Mac!  All right, if you will just sign this, releasing the ticket 
 and agreeing to my ruling.
 Don't mind if I do. 
 (Charlie groans)
 I wonder what I'm gonna do with all this money.  Maybe start an LLC. 
 Ass Pounder 4000?
 (sighs)  It's all going right into the product.  Yeah, yeah, sign the paper so you can go back in the closet. 
 DEE: Yeah.
 FRANK: Go ahead. 
 You go back in. Go ahead.
 Huh?  Well, you signed the thing. You got your money.  Just go back in the closet. Just get it over with.  CHARLIE: We know you're gonna do it, so you might as well just do it.  Yeah. Yeah.  I don't know. Maybe I'll maybe I'll stay out. 
 Really?
 Yeah.  It doesn't matter.  You can just go back in. You signed the paper.  Y-Yeah. I mean, you got your money.  No, I think I'm out now. (chuckles)  Yeah. I'm I'm gay.  Actually feels pretty good.  See ya, guys.  (exhales)  (bike squeaking) 
 Wow.
 Finally. 
 Eh, good for him, right?
 Yeah, good for him. I'm 
 Absolutely.
 Guess I'm happy for him.  Yeah, it's a relief, honestly.  All right, if, uh, you'll just take care of this,  then, uh, we'll be all done. 
 What's this?
 That would be a bill. 
 Ooh.
 Oh, money stuff. 
 Uh
 That goes to Frank.  I know it's steep, but you did go through  three arbiters, and you've been here 17 hours. 
 Yeah. I'm exhausted.
 Yikes, yikes.  What's-what's it add up to there, Frank?  $9,986. 
 Yikes.
 Holy cow, you guys aren't cheap.  (chuckles): You guys aren't cheap.  The arbitration was Mac's idea. 
 Let's let him pay for it.
 That's a great idea. 
 That's fair. In fairness' sake.
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, he's got the money for it.
 He's got the money now. Yeah.  But maybe let's make him pay it tomorrow, you know? 
 L-Let's let him have this.
 Yeah. Yeah.  Poor guy did just come out over a $14 scratcher. 
 That's all that's left?
 (chuckles): Yeah. 
 Oh, no.
 That sucks. 
 (laughter)
 CHARLIE: Oh, no.  Tell you what, man, I am happy for him, 
 but I do still hate him.
 Oh, yeah. 
 It's not a gay or straight thing, is it?
 No, no, no, no, no.  It's a Mac thing.  (trio chanting backwards)                          1  
 
 (explosion)  Come on, this way.  (explosions and gunfire outside)  Clear the room. 
 All clear, nobody's here.
 (gunfire fades)  It sounds like it got quiet out there. 
 Yeah.
 (clattering)  Shit! Frank! There's somebody here.  FRANK: Is anybody here?  Speak up we will shoot.  Wait, hold your fire, Frank! It's just a kid.  Hey, boy.  Is that water for us?  (gunfire)  Jesus Christ, Frank, you just killed a kid! 
 Eh.
 (exclaims)  Jesus Christ!  Oh, my God.  I'm gonna give him CPR.  Now, is he blowing someone? What is happening? 
 Yeah, looks like it.
 MAC: Jesus Christ,  Frank, he was just trying to give us water, man!  Forget it, he's dead.  MAC: You can't go around killing kids!  Think about his mom and his dad.  How long they been playing this for?  Oh, dude  three straight days.  They've been playing this 
 for three days?
 Yeah, absolutely.  Jesus Christ, have they slept?  No. No, they've just been wandering around the bar,  blowing kids, doing whatever they're doing, you know? 
 Frank, behind you!
 Is this where we're headed?  I mean, as a world? Know what I mean  as a society?  Hey, uh, have any of you seen my guy yet?  Oh, what is this, now? 
 What? Who?
 Huh? 
 What do you want to tell us? Just tell us.
 Oh, I just  totally hooked up with this super hot  stripper soldier last night. He's swinging by. 
 Oh, you're dating a stripper.
 Mm-hmm.  Wow, gross.  Gross? If you guys started  dating a stripper you'd be bragging about it  for days. I meet myself a Channing Tatum  and suddenly it's gross?  A what a charming taint man?  What words is she trying to say? 
 Uh, she's talking about Channing Tatum.
 Oh. 
 He's an actor.
 What do I know him in? 
 Well, he-he plays G.I. Joe.
 Oh! 
 G.I Oh, G.I. Joe's the shit.
 G.I. Joe.
 Yeah, yeah. 
 Well, then say G.I. Joe, don't make up a name.
 All right, you know what,  whatever. It doesn't matter. Anyway,  we had this really amazing connection  and the sex was so meaningful,  both of us wept tears of joy. 
 Makes me want to throw up.
 Yeah. 
 Just what happened.
 You know what I think is happening  right now? I think the guy's  coming by because you stole his watch.  Oh, right, you jacked his wallet or something  so he'd come over and you-you 
 Yeah.
 Right? Just to get him to talk to you again.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 Hello. Hey.
 Hey, Mike.  Hey. Thanks for calling me. 
 Yeah. Thanks for coming by.
 So you have my watch? 
 Oh
 Yeah. Just diving  straight into that, huh?  Listen, um, I'm really glad you called, though.  I really wanted to thank you for last night.  Thank you for last night.  Yeah. It's like, we were  having sex and the whole time 
 Yeah.
 I was like,  "What's become of me?"  You know, all I do is I strip all night, I play  video games all day, I have meaningless sex  with strangers.  My own daughter won't even  talk to me, you know? So I was  like "Damn."  And I realized I hit rock bottom.  Oh.  And that's why I was crying.  Oh. Right, yeah. 
 Yeah.
 Yeah. But don't-don't take it personally.  No. Because it Why would it be? 
 All right, cool.
 It's 
 Yeah, cool.
 Cool, 'cause it really  helped me realize that I got to give that lifestyle up. 
 Oh
 So thank you.  You're welcome.  Um I don't remember your name.  Dee.  Dee? 
 Yeah.
 Cool.  Now, can I get that watch, or 
 Hey, Dee, I think he just wants his watch.
 I think he needs his 
 Yeah, I understand.
 Yeah.  CHARLIE: Oh, yeah, yeah.     Rock bottom? Me? Uh, hey, buddy, how about when  your daughter stopped talking to you  Maybe that was your rock bottom, okay?  I'm not rock bottom.  You know what I am? I'm a rock.  Dee is a rock. In fact, I'm the type of gal 
 who makes men's lives better.
 (door opens)  Hey-o! You guys mind if I shower in that leaky urinal again?  (clicks tongue)  Well, that Don't count that.  That's not a good example.  No, I got I got to do something about this, goddamn it.  I am gonna fix this problem, 'cause I'm gonna  tell you something right now:  Sweet Dee is a rock.  Goddamn it, Frank, you shot a woman. 
 FRANK: Who cares?
 Jesus Christ, man, 
 I got to stop. This is too real.
 What, what?  I got to take a break, dude.  It's driving me insane.  Come on, how are we gonna win if you keep quitting?  I don't care! 
 Lot of storm-outs today, huh?
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. Yeah.
 This is pathetic.  Dee can't handle a little rejection. 
 (scoffs)
 Mac's banged up  over a goddamn video game. 
 Yeah.
 It's  stripper guy is traumatized  because he gets to take his clothes off  in front of a bunch of horny ladies. 
 Yeah.
 And then he has sex with one disgusting bird. 
 Yeah.
 Come on, man, 
 that's not trauma. That's not real trauma.
 Nah. It's not even 
 that bad.
 I mean, if if anything,  that's insulting to people 
 who have experienced real trauma.
 Yeah. 
 I think it is. Yeah.
 I mean, like  you, for instance.  Uh, me?  Well, yeah. Sure, man.  I mean, you grew up fatherless.  You were raised by a woman who was basically a prostitute.  Well, the father stuff was real.  Yeah, without a doubt.  Got some daddy issues there.  And-and you, too. I mean,  like, you know, what happened with you  with Ms. Klinsky, the librarian. I mean, you were raped. 
 Ah. No. St
 And tha-that's got to affect you. 
 That's trauma.
 Will you stop?  Why do you guys br no. That wasn't a rape, okay? 
 It was.
 That was a mutual No, stop. Like 
 She's an older woman, you were a younger
 (scoffs)  A woman can't rape a guy. 
 An older woman can rape a younger
 It's not 
 Doesn't matter. That's not the point.
 Oh, yeah. Right, right. 
 This is separate, yeah.
 Look, it's  It's not the point. The point is,  yeah, fine, I'll do it.  You'll do what?  I'll strip. Yeah.  Huh. I didn't realize you were talking about that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 Huh.
 You know,  if this Mike fella wants to walk away  from an amazing stripping career,  hey, I'll take up that mantle.  You know, frankly, I'm a little disappointed  in myself for not thinking of it before.  You know? It just makes sense.  Right, yeah.  Here's the thing, man. I can't do it without you.  I need you to get my back.  Oh, uh, you want me to strip with you?  Oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no.  I-I-I no, I just literally  need you to have a look at my back, you know,  make sure there's no moles  or, like, unsightly hairs,  bumps, zits, you know, 
 that kind of thing.
 Ah, yeah  And then, you know, get after it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll clean you up.  All right, all right, I can do that. 
 Cool.
 Cool, man. You be my boy?  Yeah, I'll be the boy.  Well, just be my L-like my bag boy.  You know, carry around my-my lotions,  my oils, my scents, my razors.  Cool, man. Chill, chill.  Yeah, that's cool, right? 
 Yeah, that's cool, bro. Cool.
 Cool.    MAC: Frank, where are you, man?  I can't see.  Jesus Christ.  (gunfire)  Oh, who's there?! Oh  Hey, boy.  How you doing, man?  (yelling)  (yelling, groaning)  No! Baba!    Mother!  Oh, shit!  Oh, no, man!  I'm so sorry, man.  Hey, son.  Dad?! What are you doing here?  How did you get in the game?  Guess we  won't be having that catch  after all.  You were gonna have a catch with me?  I was, but (coughs)  you killed me, son.  (gasps)  I love 
 (groans)
 Wa-Wa  Wait! Wait, Dad! Who do you love?  Dad, who do you love? Wait.  Dad, who do you love? No, Dad! No!  (gasps loudly)  (guttural panting)  (whispering): What the hell?  Oh, was that a dream?  Dennis?  Oh, my God, man, I just had the weirdest dream.  (Dennis hums along percussively to dance music)  (sighs)  (gasps loudly, panting)  (gasping)  (loud snoring)  (crickets chirping)  (sighs)  (loud snoring)  (Dennis humming percussively)  (phone ringing)  (groaning) 
 What?
 MAC: Frank.  Look, I-I I can't sleep. I'm having nightmares. 
 Dead kids, dads.
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Mac.  Slow down. What are you saying?  I got to quit the game, dude. I can't 
 do this anymore.
 No, no, no.  Don't quit just yet. 
 Look, have a drink and calm down.
 Okay, fine.  (sighs) I'll calm down. I'll-I'll drink some whiskey or something.  Yeah, stuff it down with brown.  That's the best way to deal with things.  (quietly): Okay.  Kid's a mess.  Goddamn it, Charlie, we're 30 minutes late, man.  I'm so sorry I cut your back so many times, man. 
 What happened?
 I was nervous, dude. 
 Why?
 I've never, like, cut such a muscular back. 
 Thanks, man.
 Yeah. Oh, dude, your back looks great, man.  I'm working hard, dude.  Dude, you're putting the work in, and it's showing, man. 
 Thank you so much, man. I really appreciate that.
 Yeah, right, right, right, right.  But just let's not talk about it in there. 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 Don't bring it up.  Can you walk me through what your guy is again?  Okay, so here's the deal, man.  Who do girls want to have sex with more than anybody else? 
 Jugglers.
 Jug? 
 Dudes who can, like, juggle things.
 I know what a juggler is. 
 You know, with the fire sticks and the balls.
 Yeah.  No, they don't want to have sex with a juggler.  They want to have sex with their dads. 
 Weird.
 Yeah, it is weird, so I'm a dad.  Oh. Okay, cool. Oh, and I'm your boy. 
 All right, that works.
 Well, no. What? Why would you be my boy?  Oh, you said I was gonna be your boy 'cause I have daddy trauma,  and then, I didn't realize I was gonna be your boy  in there, but that works great.  No, that doesn't make any sense.  How would you be my s?  I'm their dad. How could I also be your dad?  We can't all be related. Christ, Charlie, you're not making any sense, man.  Yeah, I mean, you could have a lot of kids, I guess.  I got to say, though, I'm looking inside there,  and this isn't making sense to me.  I mean, these are all older women. Might be  a little bit hard for me to pull off the dad thing at all. 
 That's not a good play.
 You know,  I'm getting a bad feeling about this, man.  Hey, man, do you think maybe that's 'cause 
 of your librarian trauma?
 You're talking about Ms. Klinsky? 
 Yeah, she was an older woman, and
 What? No. There was  Let's not talk Can we stop talking about trauma 
 and-and-and cuts on the on peoples' backs?
 Yes.  And let's It's not sexy, okay? 
 Okay, yeah, well, then let's split.
 Okay. 
 All right, let's go.
 All right, man.  Are you the stripper? 
 Oh, uh, yeah, that's him.
 Uh (laughs) 
 What, are you 40?
 Yup.  Fine. You guys'll do, I guess.  Y-You guys? No. Sorry. I'm just the boy. 
 The what?
 Just
 Sorry. I'm-I'm his boy.  Well, you're not my boy. He's not (chuckles)  Are you gonna stand out here and talk like little bitches,  or are you gonna come inside and take your dicks out for money?  Daddy?  Just don't call me Daddy.  FRANK: Yeah, my generation  we drank our problems away.  But since you softies like to talk about everything,  I figured this was a good thing to do.  A PTSD support group, Frank?  Yeah, yeah. Maybe you'll get some help, 
 we can finish the damn game.
 What's up, dicks?  What the hell are you doing here?  Well, because I am a rock and not a rock bottom, I decided  to reach out to Mike and see if I could get him some help  with, uh, some of these issues he's been having.  I'm confused. Is this a PTSD meeting for vets?  Mm-hmm, yeah. You're a military guy, right?  No. It was just my stripper character.  Really? Oh, I just figured you based 
 your characters off past experiences.
 Why?  Okay, look, I-I'm not gonna pass myself off as a vet, Frank. 
 Yeah, I don't feel good about this. Maybe
 Well, then just don't talk. 
 But
 You don't have to talk. Just sit down.  Okay, everybody, let's grab a chair, let's get this started. 
 Probably not gonna call on you anyway.
 MAN: Okay, right off  the bat, I can see we got some newcomers  here today. You guys want to introduce yourselves?  Ugh. Goddamn it.  Uh, I'm Frank.  I've been around the block, seen some action.  I was in 'Nam for a while.  Private sector mostly.  I did shoot a couple of dinks  who tried to jack some sneakers off the factory floor.  No big deal.  I don't feel nothing about it.  I'm just here to support my buddy.  DEE (clears throat): Uh  Hello. I'm Dee. I'm a rock.  I'm here with this guy.  There was a bit of a mix-up about his military credentials,  but, uh whatever.  Now he's under the delusion that he's hit rock bottom,  you know, and I just don't see how that's possibly true, so,  we're gonna straighten that up while we're  sitting here today, you know.  Mac's being a pussy!  He doesn't want to fight anymore!  I'm not being a pussy.  I just don't want to kill women and children.  FRANK: How do I get him  to stop thinking of them as real people?  Mike's embarrassed about his dancing,  and I just I don't get that.  I don't How is that rock bottom behavior?  You know? Think of Channing Tatum.  Can you please explain Channing Tatum to him? 
 I'm not sure I follow
 Oh, yeah. He's G.I. Joe.  FRANK: Mac can't sleep at night.  He's having erotic nightmares and shit. 
 He doesn't know what's real anymore.
 DEE: Yeah.  Mike's embarrassed about his video game-playing, which makes  no sense to me, 'cause you know what? Video games are hard. 
 You ever play Fallujah?
 Beat it five times. 
 You want to play with me?
 I'm actually trying to get away from that.  Well, what if he paid you?  Ten bucks an hour. 
 20.
 Deal. 
 Wow. Really?
 Well, will you look at that?  Now we're getting somewhere, huh? 
 Yeah.
 That couldn't have happened  without your rock, could it?  Wait a second, Frank. What about me?  You're out. Dishonorable discharge.  MAN: I'm sorry.  What is happening here?  Doesn't matter. We're done with you. 
 Yeah, we're good.
 Yeah.  (crickets chirping)  (loud snoring) 
 Hey, son.
 (gasps) Dad?!  What are you doing here?  I broke out of jail and came straight to see you. 
 Because you love me?
 'Cause I'm gonna kill you, son.  (muffled yelling): Oh. Oh, no!  (loudly gasping for air)  What? What-What's happening?  When did I get here? How long have I been asleep?  You got here, like, five minutes ago.  You've been asleep for 35 seconds.  Oh, Jesus Christ, I'm-I'm losing my mind. 
 I mean, I'm actually going insane.
 DENNIS: You know,  we're all having a little bit of a hard time right now. 
 Yeah.
 But we got to fight fire with fire,  and Charlie and I refuse to be defeated by this.  We're gonna win this war.  What war? 
 The war on women!
 Women, man!  There's a war on women? Can I get in on that? 
 (phone ringing)
 Bro, it's been raging  since the beginning of time, bro. 
 Oh.
 And we're losing ground.  Phone! 
 Hello.
 (disguising her voice): Ah, yeah.  Uh, yeah, is youse Daddy and the Boy? 
 Uh, y-yes, it is. Boy speaking.
 Oh.  Yeah. Uh, I hear youse are re rule good.  Well, yeah, that-that is true.  Well, I've got a party for you. 
 Um, Daddy wants to speak with you.
 Yeah.  Yeah, this is Daddy. What's-what's the gig?  Uh, yeah, a giant party. Tons of sorority girls.  Sorority girls. Oh, sorority girls. Nice.  Did you just lick your hand? Yeah, that  that sounds good. Um, listen, a few new ground rules, though.  I'm a bad dad now. And, uh,  the Boy's also gonna be dancing with me.  Okay. Uh, whatever. Uh, uh  Yeah, we need Mike. We need him. 
 Mike? Why do you want Mike, Dee?
 What? You knew it was me?  Of course I knew it was you. Who else does accents so poorly?  The accents were terrible. 
 The accents were terrible.
 All right, look, I just  I want him to have fun, make a ton of money,  party with a bunch of sorority girls, you know?  I need to show him that this is a great life.  This is not a rock-bottom life.  We'll do it at Paddy's. It'll be a win-win. 
 Make a ton of mon
 Mmm.  Yes. Okay.  What? Hello?  Goddamn it.  This is good. This is th-this is good.  Young girl sorority girls. It's, like, age-appropriate for me,  you know? Not like those perverted librarians. 
 Cougars. Whatever, man.
 Yeah.  And it's gonna be on our home turf. Like, Paddy's. 
 Whoa. And with Mike, we'll be like a
 Oh.  We'll be like an elite stripping dance force, like a unit, man.  Dude, dude, dude, dude, 
 we're gonna look good, man.
 Yeah. Yeah, man.  We're gonna win this war. 
 Oh, hell yeah. Oh, yeah.
 We're gonna win this war on women.  You know what, Mac, maybe we could use you after all. 
 He's asleep.
 Yeah, he's out.   
 (snarling)
 (gunfire)  It's amazing! I can't believe they have zombies  on the final level!  I love zombies. Ghouls, too. I love ghouls.  Right now, if we can just make it to that second box  over there, we can grab the all spark coin  and we can win the game.  (distorted voices)    (gunfire) 
 (distorted shouting)
 MAC (distorted): Frank. Frank.  Frank!  Frank!  (gasps) Oh. What happened? 
 Where am I?
 Oh, you're in the back office.  You passed out playing the game, dude.  We dragged you back here so you could sleep.  Oh, Mac. I think I was too hard on you.  I think I got PTSD, too. 
 Oh, no. We don't have that.
 Huh?  Yeah, I actually slept about ten hours last night, dude,  and I feel great.  I think we were just suffering from sleep deprivation.  Well, where's Mike? I want to finish the game.  Oh, we finished the game. Yeah, like, right after  you passed out, Mike and I just got in there. 
 Dude, it was awesome.
 Do you want to do it again?  No, I don't want to play anymore.  Well, where's Mike? I'll do it with him.  He's out, too. Yeah, he's doing  some weird stripping thing with Dennis and Charlie.  I only woke you up 'cause I figured you'd want to see it. 
 Yeah?
 Yeah.  (indistinct chatter)  I really appreciate you getting me  this gig. I mean, truthfully,  I don't think I was ready to give this lifestyle up.  Of course not. Why would you? You're really good  at dancing. That's nothing to be ashamed of.  Listen, you like video games? I got you paid for it.  You're a great stripper? I got you this gig. 
 And you know what I'm gonna do for you next?
 What?  I'm gonna reunite you with your daughter. 
 Oh, man.
 Yep.  Look, I really appreciate everything you've done. 
 It really, really means a lot to me.
 Eh, well,  you just needed your rock.  Fire it up. 
 Smell good? Everything poppin'?
 All right. No, feels good. 
 Look good?
 I don't know. What do you think? 
 You like how it smells?
 It looks good. 
 And you can't see any of the blood.
 Okay, good.  It's all patched up good. 
 What do you think about my prop, hmm?
 That's really cool. 
 A little kid licking that up there.
 Wait, what-what am I smelling?  Cheese. 
 Is that made of cheese?
 Yeah, yeah.  And then I painted the rest with, like, magic marker and stuff.  Oh, Christ. Why did you make a cheese lollipop? It stinks. 
 For-for my nerves. Yeah.
 That smells horrible.  Oh, God. There's nothing sexy about cheese. Put it away. 
 (cheering)
 Ladies,  are we ready to party tonight?  (whooping)  So am I. 
 (gasping)
 All right.  We're gonna see some skin tonight. Yeah.  Scars and all.  This, actually, is a real scar, too.  And I got a good story behind that.  This is, uh They took out the kidney, actually,  from the fron A Chinaman. And he did not know  how to do it, I'll tell you that much. 
 (groans)
 Cricket was a bad idea, huh?  Yeah, I know. But we needed that, like, you know, 
 McConaughey emcee-type.
 Yeah. But looks like we got  AIDS Dallas Buyers Club McConaughey, 
 not Magic Mike McConaughey.
 That is what he looks like. 
 It's a good crowd, though. It's a good crowd.
 He's Yeah.  All right, well  That was the first time that I really thought,  "Hey, I might actually, uh  I might die, and and no one's gonna remember."  All right! Hey!  Let's, uh, keep it movin'.  Keepin' it real, keepin' it sexy,  and takin' back the power,  let's give it up for Daddy and the Boy! 
 (cheering and applause)
 (Harry Chapin's "Cat's in the Cradle" playing)  Hey, Boy, let's have a catch.  My child arrived   Over here, Pop.  Hey. Good throw, son.  I love you, Dad! 
 I love you, too, son.
 Oh?  And even though I never even said it enough.  What is this?  I wasn't a good Shh!  I wasn't a good father to you, and-and I regret that now.  No, that's fine, because now is our chance to connect.  This is super weird.  Hey! Shush, all right?  This is our thing. We have the power. You don't talk.  All right, you know what, Dad, don't listen to them,  'cause we're gonna win this war.  This is not sexy!  Just take something off!  You know, you take something off!  All right, look, it's too hot for baseball. 
 I'm gonna take my clothes off now. I think.
 (whooping) 
 Okay!
 Yeah, now we'll take our clothes off. 
 (laughter)
 (laughing): Yeah!  Wait, wait, son, don't. Don't. They're laughing.  Don't take your clothes off if they're laughing. We have the power. 
 It's not a joke!
 It's not a joke, all right? This is sexy.  (women booing)  Oh, stop, sto Oh, you know what?  You might want to check your programs 'cause I'm bad dad now.  I'll take you to your goddamn room. 
 I'll bend you over my knee.
 Take your dicks out!  All right, listen to me. This is it, this is what you were made for.  Now you get out there and save the day, soldier. 
 (women continue booing)
 DENNIS: This is about a father and a son 
 whose relation
 CHARLIE: Oh, come on!  CRICKET: And now the moment you've all been waiting for.  Soldier boy, Mike.  Everybody got 'em, everybody got 'em   E-E-Everybody got 'em, e-e-everybody, everybody   Everybody got 'em, everybody got 'em  
 (women cheering)
  E-E-Everybody got 'em   E-E-Everybody, everybody   Everybody got 'em, everybody got 'em   E-E-Everybody got 'em, e-e-everybody, everybody   Everybody got 'em, everybody got 'em   E-E-Everybody, every   (screams)  (music stops, cheering dies down) 
 Dad?
 Oh, Janie? 
 Oh!
 Your cock was in my face!  Oh, God, I didn't mean to! I didn't mean to!  You're disgusting!  My finger touched your asshole!  (all groan and gasp)  Never talk to me again!  (cackles) I got you!  I got you. I'm your rock bottom?  I'm your rock That's your rock bottom,  sticking your dick in your daughter's face, you son of a bitch. 
 Why would you do that?!
 Get out of here!  That's my daughter!  (chuckling): Oh.  Yes!  (Charlie whistles, Mac sighs) 
 DENNIS: Wow.
 Jesus Christ. 
 Wow, Dee, that was dark.
 That's like the darkest thing you've ever done.  You know what that was? 
 That was your rock bottom.
 Yeah. 
 Yeah.
 Hmm.
 (scoffs) Whatever.  Feel good. I don't want to talk about it.  I don't want to talk about my thing. You want to talk about your thing? 
 No, no, let's not.
 You know what we should do?  Let's just, uh let's just get drunk. 
 Yeah, come on.
 Let's not talk about trauma. 
 Or deal with any of that shit.
 Woo.  Let's just have a good time and get drunk, huh?  Stuff it down with some brown.  (all agreeing)  And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon                          1 (indistinct conversations)  CHARLIE: Oh, that's fresh, dude. Yeah, that's real nice.  Seriously, you're gonna bring that up again? Jerry, Jerry,  Jerry I'm so sick of hearing about Jerry, man. 
 Everything is "Jerry" out of you mouth.
 Hey, hey, hey, uh,  Ch-Charlie, I need a new keg. 
 This one's tapped, buddy.
 Yeah, give me a second.  Like, if Jerry jumped off a bridge would you jump off it, too? 
 Which bridge?
 Guys, guys 
 Which bridge, really?
 Yeah, yeah.  Guys, guys, please stop arguing, okay? Can you just  can you do your jobs today? We got a bunch of customers in here.  I want to take advantage of it.  Look, can you just tell him to get rid of Jerry first?  I'm sorry, I don't even know who that is. 
 My tapeworm.
 You have a tapeworm? 
 Yeah, he got a worm.
 Yeah. Got a tapeworm.  And you named it? 
 Jerry.
 Jerry.  Yeah, okay, great. Look, guys, can we not do this?  Can we not talk about worms or sewers or rats today, with all these  people in here? We got a good thing going. 
 Charlie, new keg.
 Well, I just think maybe I'm a little sensitive  because it's Valentine's Day and I don't really  want to hear about Jerry all day long.  But, yeah, fine, what do you want  you want me to put pink ink in the beer or something, 
 make it all inky and pink?
 I No, no, no, no.  I don't want to do Valentine's Day shit, okay?  I don't want to do that. All right, look, all these people  are in here today because they don't have people who love them  and get them shit on Valentine's Day. All right?  So, can we not remind them of that with inky beer?  All right, fine. Can you just tell him to get lost, then?  And then we'll go back to the way things were. 
 Who?
 Jerry. 
 The worm?
 Yeah.  It's an intestinal parasite, incapable of complex thought.  You just described my ex-husband. 
 Oh (laughing)
 Oh 
 Yeah, he's a
 He can't think, yeah.  That's pretty funny. 
 Hey, Dee! Yeah!
 All right, Dee!  (chanting): Dee! Dee! Dee! Dee! Dee! Dee! Dee!  Dee is in the house, uh, Dee is in the house, 
 uh, Dee is in the house.
 Oh
 Oh 
 Thanks for the chant, guys. What's up?
 Yeah, no,  we were talking about the new Dee, the funny one. 
 Her?
 Yeah. 
 Yeah.
 Why are you calling her Dee?  Oh, well, she's like a new regular. She's been coming in here.  You know, trying to make her feel more at home. 
 It's a nickname, short for Dottie.
 Then call her Dot.  Nah, we already started calling her Dee and it kind of stuck.  You know, can't really change it now. It's locked in.  That's my nickname, bitch. Don't you take my nickname.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, hey, hey! 
 You bitch! Get out of here!
 What are you  Don't-don't yell at the customers, okay?  Look, we got a good thing going here, all right?  We got a bunch of new customers in here.  We got a regular, we might get more regulars. 
 Let's not screw this up.
 MAC: Guys, guys. 
 I've got news, I've got glorious news.
 Oh!  (chanting): Mac! Mac! Mac! Mac!  Mac is in the house, Mac is in the house.  Thanks for the chant, guys. Listen, I need everybody  to drop everything and come out to the back alley.  There is an unopened crate out there. 
 An un an unopened crate?
 Crate? Oh!
 Crate? 
 Hey, there's a crate!
 Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa! 
 We got a crate.
 Let's go! 
 We have a crate.
 No. 
 What, what?
 Stop, hey, stop! 
 What? What?
 Stop! Stop.  We got a bar full of customers here.  So what? Oh! Oh, shit, okay, okay, you know what I'll do?  Um, I can put a fan next to the yuck puddle, 
 and the smell's gonna clear everybody out.
 Oh!  I don't want to clear everybody out. I'm saying  why are we running out of the bar to-to look 
 in some dumb crate?
 Well, it's not about the crate.  It's about the mystery of what's inside the crate 
 that gets us.
 Yeah, the straw. 
 Yeah. Well, not the straw, though.
 No. 
 Not the straw?
 No, not the straw. 
 Whatever's in the crate, like
 Oh. 
 Yeah, it's worth a look.
 It's not worth a look.  It's trash. There's nothing in there. There never is.  This is what I'm saying. Why  We're always running outside,  out into the world, looking for riches and treasures  when we've got everything we need right here.  Oh, you're saying we do, like, a booze for money type scheme.  That's good. Who came up with that? 
 Oh. Was it me?
 Who came up with that?  Whoever invented the idea of a bar.  Which is what we decided to do years ago  when we bought this goddamn place. So, can we please,  for once in our lives, not go chasing after crates?  You know, and talk about worms?  Right? Yelling at the customers and shit?  Can we just do the one thing we've never tried?  Can we just do our jobs?   
  
 (indistinct conversations)  '89, good.  Damn drunks.  Rum and Coke, tequila soda.  Pay me.  All right, that's gonna be five.  Out of 20.  Yup.  Aw, she wants another mojito.  Looks like our regular's got herself a usual.  You bet. 
 (chuckles)
 Yo. I am all done with my work.  Can we go check out that crate now?  What? You're not done.  Shit, how'd you know?  Because the bar's still open.  You're not done till we close.  Hey, what do you say you and me go out the back  and check out that crate. Just the two of us  No one else has to know. Just to get it off our minds.  It's not on my mind, okay? Let it go. Christ, five people  have walked in here since we started this conversation.  Can you go check their IDs so we don't get another  underage drinking situation on our hands? 
 Just got my mind on that crate.
 Right, well, 
 get your mind on your job.
 FRANK: Done, done, done. 
 Done with my work.
 Oh, Christ, they're like dominoes.  Frank, you're not done 
 until the end of the day.
 I already cooked the books.  How about you don't cook the books so we can actually tell 
 how the business is doing?
 Oh, well  It's crazy. How are we ever gonna  Oh, the soda gun's clogged.  Dude, can you go clear the lines for me?  Trick Charlie into doing it.  Well, I want you to do it.  I can't trick Charlie.  Charlie's pretending to ignore me because he's jealous of Jerry.  I-I don't want you to trick Charlie. 
 I want you to clear the lines.
 Speaking of Jerry 
 Break time.
 What do you mean?  Lunch.  I'm craving salty,  but Jerry likes sweet.  What are you doing? Don't-don't reach your hands directly in the 
 This is sweet.
 Oh, Jesus Christ, get out of here,  Frank, you're an animal.  He won't stop eating, 
 yet he's just wasting away.
 Yeah.  I mean, can you believe them?  You know, I can't even play Night Crawlers with him anymore  'cause he doesn't want to offend Jerry.  I'm gonna stop you there, Charlie, because  I've exhausted my daily quota of worm talk and worm-related issues. 
 What are you doing?
 Yeah. 
 Don't reach your hands in there!
 Why not?  Jesus Christ Oh, God. Look,  can you just can you please go clear the lines for me?  Are they clogged?  Yeah. 
 Just trick Dee into it.
 It's not a tri  See, this is the problem. You guys all think that work  is tricking people. It's not. It's just your job.  So, can you please go do it? In all the time  that we've talked about tricking each other into doing our jobs  we could've made 1,000 drinks.  Yeah, maybe.  All right, let me see if I can trick Mac into it first.  Don't trick anybody, just do it Oh, goddamn.  I need two shots of whiskey.  Two shots of whiskey. Okay, yes, nice.  Finally, somebody's actually working.  You know what, I appreciate that, Dee. 
 I appreciate you.
 All right, what are you doing?  No, no, no, no, no. 
 That was a big one. Thank you.
 The other one, too.  Yeah, that's what this is. Okay, so,  clearly, you're not busy, so, I need somebody  to clear the lines. The soda gun's clogged.  Did Charlie ask you to trick me?  Trick you? No, the It's not a trick.  The soda gun is clogged, I cannot make drinks.  I don't know. I don't trust Charlie today.  You know, I made him a valentine  He hasn't given me shit yet in return.  Why the hell did you do that? We don't do valentines anymore.  I know, but we used to, and it was fun, you know? It was a goof.  It wasn't a goof. You guys were supposed to give valentine's  cards to each other, but instead you were just sticking hate mail  in a suggestion box covered in hearts.  I'll give it to you, though it got a little nasty at the end.  A-A little bit nasty?  One of you put anthrax in the box.  Or do you not remember the anthrax scare?  Oh, ho, I remember the anthrax scare.  To many, 9/18 was the delivery world's 9/11.  (chuckles) That's a good point. No, I'm talking about  a different anthrax scare, but it shouldn't concern you. 
 Stop it!
 She just talks too much. 
 Hey-oh!
 Oh! 
 Cricket!
 Cricket! 
 Cricket!
 Hey, you guys mind  if I go in the bathroom and smoke some PCP? 
 CHARLIE: No, dude, you do you!
 FRANK: Go for it.  MAC: You do you! 
 You do you!
 You do you!  We don't judge, Cricket, we don't judge.  What are you doing? Guys, guys, guys, what in the hell are you doing? 
 Cricket.
 Cricket.  Yeah, Cricket. This has got to stop, you guys. This is nuts.  We can't go around encouraging homeless men  to smoke PCP in our restrooms,  you know, trying to trick each other into doing our jobs  and getting fired up at the-the mere mention of a crate. 
 Oh, but it's just such a mystery, isn't it?
 Yeah. 
 Cool crate.
 It's a big box.  Yeah, yeah, it really isn't though. It's just trash.  It's trash that somebody left behind.  Hey, but if it's mystery you want,  you know, what about the mystery of the yuck puddle?  What the hell is that thing, you know? Why won't it dry up?  Why won't it harden?  It shifts. I've seen it shift.  He's seen it shift. You see, we shouldn't have  an amorphous shifting blob in the bar, you know?  So why don't you and Mac go solve  that goddamn mystery by cleaning it up, you know?  And, oh, what about the mystery of the clogged soda gun,  you know? Dee, why don't you and Frank go solve  that mystery by clearing the lines?  Well, that's-that's not such a mystery.  And we could probably trick Cricket into doing it.  Oh, why don't we just trick  Cricket doesn't work here though. 
 But that's free labor.
 Yeah, yeah. 
 That's kind of better.
 Get him for free.  You're not you're not getting  Hey, just do your jobs!  Just do your jobs.  (bubbling)  Why isn't it getting any smaller?  Can I be honest, dude? I think this thing's alive.  Oh, that must be what all the bubbling's about,  'cause it's, like, trying to communicate.  It definitely feeds. I-I've found bones in it, man. 
 So it wants to live.
 Yeah, dude, I don't know  what I'm gonna do during the next inspection,  'cause I-I can't get rid of this thing.  (sighs) So Dennis has sent us in here to do the impossible.  Absolutely. Dude, what is going on with him, right?  Like, there's got to be something in this whole "do your job" angle.  'Cause that doesn't sound like Dennis to me, 
 you know what I mean?
 I know, dude.  He's acting, like, so weird, especially towards me.  I think it's because I'm gay and he's, like, 
 totally uncomfortable with it.
 Y  Well, no, 'cause he's known that forever, so it's, you know  Well, he may have suspected it before, but there's no way  he could have known for sure. 'Cause I show no outward signs  of being gay, and that's just the end of the story, all right?  But, look, either way, he's been acting very distant towards me,  and I feel like he sent me in here to punish me or something,  because, I agree, the whole, like, "do your job" angle 
 just seems, like, totally out of the blue, and, like
 It's, like, a bullshit thing, right? 
 Like
 Unless Oh, my God.  What?  Charlie, he doesn't want us to work at all. 
 (gasps) He doesn't?
 No.  He doesn't want us to mop up the yuck puddle. 
 He wants us to "mop up the yuck puddle."
 Oh!  Of emotions.  Of what? 
 It's a metaphor.
 For what?  He wants us to talk through our personal issues and be more open  with our feelings because it's Valentine's Day.  Oh! Weird. That doesn't sound like Dennis, but, uh 
 Go with me here, dude.
 Okay.  Valentine's Day is an entire day dedicated to feelings, 
 something that Dennis doesn't have.
 Right, that's true.  And so that's why he hates Valentine's Day so much.  But he's entrusted me, because I'm a gay man 
 and clearly more sensitive than the rest of you,
 Well, no, 
 to break down those walls.
 but okay. All right. 
 All right, cool. Yeah, yeah.
 Yes, okay, so I'll share first. 
 Okay.
 Okay. I have a huge surprise  for Dennis, but I feel like he's not emotionally available to  Uh, uh, Frank's gonna leave me for Jerry, man.  Oh, uh, I was talking. But, uh,  I guess we'll, um we'll do your thing first.  You know he's only doing this to get a rise out of you, right? 
 Oh, that's so Jerry.
 No,  not Jerry. Not the worm. Never the worm.  We're talking about Frank, okay?  If you just pretend to like the worm,  then he'll probably just get rid of it.  Oh, shit. You think so?  I know so, buddy. 
 Nice, man. All right.
 Yeah. Okay, now back to my thing. 
 Yeah, that just gave me a great idea.
 If I just give 
 Thanks, Mac.
 Charlie, if you just  You're not gonna let me talk?!  So, uh, you're gay, huh?  For pay or for free?  Uh, for free, I guess.  Chump. 
 It's taking forever.
 (grunts) 
 Ugh.
 Try sucking on the other end, maybe.  I'm not sucking on the other end. Get that shit in my mouth?  No, thanks. And what the hell's going on with Dennis?  Since when does he care how the bar does?  (grunts) I don't know. It doesn't add up.  I can't get a read on him these days. He's just always cranky and irritated. 
 Rage-filled, rape-y.
 It's like,  as the years go by, he just gets more and more irrational. 
 Yeah, yeah.
 Especially with this whole "work the bar" angle. 
 I mean, what is that?
 (scoffs)  Unless  Oh, my God.  Dennis doesn't want us to work the bar. 
 He doesn't?
 No!  He wants us to work on ourselves.  What the shit are you talking about?  Just go with me here. It's Valentine's Day, right,  a day we all used to love and enjoy until we turned  on each other with the hate mail.  Dennis wants us to work through our personal issues  so we can enjoy Valentine's Day again. 
 I got it.
 Yeah. Okay, so I'm gonna go first.  I'm so mad at Charlie, because I made him a valentine,  and, you know what, he didn't even really  I gave myself Jerry on purpose.  Well, I was right in the middle of a sentence, but what?  I gave myself the tapeworm. 
 Well, that is the most disgusting thing I've
 How, you're wondering.  No, I don't. No, thanks.  I bought poop on the dark Web  and stuffed it up my butt to lose weight. 
 Jesus Christ. Uh, that's enough.
 Yeah. 
 Well, it took about four ounces of it.
 I-I  That's enough! I don't want to know!  With the tip of a teaspoon. 
 Okay Frank!
 How else?  Stop answering questions I'm not asking, okay? 
 I'm done, I'm done.
 I had to hold my knees  above my head for a half hour 
 and clench my sphincter.
 Stop! Stop!  (indistinct chatter)  (muttering) Charlie, I'm mad, 
 and I think we need to clear the lines.
 Huh? 
 Uh, just-just trick somebody else into it.
 No, that's not what I'm  Wh-What are you doing?  (sighs) I'm trying to write a valentine. I just  Oh. (chuckling): Okay.  Uh, okay. Well, I'll just, uh, let you finish. 
 Didn't mean to interrupt.
 Okay.  I also got you a box of chocolates, so 
 (chuckles)
 Right.  Oh, oh! Wait, wait, wait, wait! Dee, Dee, Dee. 
 Yeah.
 Um, c-can you think  of a word that rhymes with "Jerry"? 
 What?
 I can't think of one.  Are you making a valentine for Frank's tapeworm?  Well, not if I can't think of a word that rhymes with "Jerry." 
 You son of a bitch.
 What? 
 I can't believe you don't know!
 I have no idea!  Oh, and literally everything rhymes with "Jerry," okay? 
 Scary, hairy, Mother Mary, quite contrary.
 (stammering)  Woozy, woozy. Woozy from sucking lines. 
 Ho. (whoops)
 All right, Frank, Frank, Frank,  before you do another thing, 
 I wanted to give you a valentine.
 Unbelievable!  Right in front of me? 
 You did?
 Yeah-huh. 
 Charlie. Well
 Well, it's for both of you guys, but, these, 
 these are just for Jerry.
 (Dee gasps) No. 
 Charlie. Oh.
 Yeah. (laughs) 
 Oh, that's so sweet.
 Look at that. 
 Thank
 You dick. 
 You shouldn't have. Mmm.
 No! No, he didn't.  Listen to me, I got these for him, all right? 
 So no.
 Mmm? 
 I got these.
 Our blood sugar's low. Mmm. 
 Oh, guess what, I bought these for him.
 Mmm 
 (laughs)
 (Frank moaning)  You fool! 
 It's so good, Charlie.
 Those chocolates  that you're so gleefully devouring  are chock-full of Bye-Bye Jerry pills.  You wouldn't.  Oh, but I would, Frank.  You see, I knew you'd never take the pills willingly.  But Jerry  Jerry likes sweet, doesn't he?  You poisoned me. 
 (grunting)
 No. No, he poisoned me.  At worst, you're properly medicated.  (laughs)  (groans) You son of a bitch. 
 Charlie.
 Bye-bye Jerry!  (Frank groans) I'm poisoned. 
 (shouts)
  Poisoned! I'm poisoned.  What are you doing? 
 We've been poisoned.
 No, No.  No, no, no, nobody's been poisoned. 
 They're just
 CHARLIE: Plenty more poison 
 where that came from!
 (bar patrons gasp) 
 DENNIS: Uh, there is no
 So, don't even think  about trying to get another worm, Frank.  And there are no-no worms. 
 Nobody has worms.
 Well, not anymore 
 they don't.
 (Dennis groans)  DENNIS: Don't leave. Please, don't leave.  Guys, what are you doing?  Take this discussion someplace else.  No, I'm good because I've had a great Valentine's Day.  Bye-bye, Jerry.  Are you serious?!  You son of a bitch, Charlie. You screwed me, okay?! 
 What are you talking about?
 You know what  screw you, Charlie!  I'm not gonna let some worm beat me on Valentine's Day. 
 Don't talk about
 Why are you going on and on about it?  I I did this for you, Charlie.  What?  I gave myself Jerry on purpose.  Why would you do that?  To slim down for you.  Why would you why would you slim down for me? What?  Because I overheard you on the phone saying,  "He got flabby."  No, no, no, buddy. I never said that.  I sa I-I-I said you were crabby because you smelled crabby  'cause you've been eating 
 all those sewer crabs, man, but..
 (Dennis stammers) 
 Take it outside.
 It was a compliment. I love when you 
 smell like crab, Frank.
 (Dennis pounds on bar)  Take the conversation someplace else. 
 (door opens, closes)
 Okay? Don't do it here.  You-you didn't think I was too fat?  Well, no, you were fat as shit, pal, but I loved you that way, Frank. 
 Fat and crabby.
 (door opens)  FRANK: So, you want to try and get this dead worm out of me?  CHARLIE: I would love to pull that dead worm out of you.  Yeah?! Come on. Come on, now oh  Stop, stop! Goddamn it, stop. What are you guys doing? 
 Huh?
 What are you talking about? 
 Getting the worm.
 You-you're gonna talk  about pulling a dead worm out of his ass?  Don't do that. Please, don't talk about these things.  Now, by the grace of God, we somehow still have Dottie here  so, please, don't scare her away.  Sorry, Dottie. 
 Who's ready to die, bitches?!
 DENNIS: Dee 
 FRANK: Whoa!
 No.  What are you doing with the Valentine's box? 
 Put that down.
 All right, just think  about what you're doing, Dee.  I know exactly what I'm doing.  Okay, okay, fine. Dee, just don't mention 
 I am busting out the anthrax.
 CHARLIE: No! 
 And I'm out.
 DENNIS: Dottie, no.  No, you don't have to go. 
 Oh, goddamn it!
 Charlie.  I'm getting a goddamn valentine right goddamn now, or so help me God  I will end us all.  No, don't. Give the bitch what she wants. 
 I will
 I'm so frustrated right now.  Okay, fine, Dee. You know what I'm gonna do?  I'm gonna sing you a song.  Okay? A Valentine's Day song?  All right? Is that will that work? 
 Fine. Sing a song.
 Okay.  Uh a Dee song. 
 Nothing rhymes with Dee.
 Every!  (whispering): Everything rhymes with Dee. 
 I mean, literally, everything rhymes
 Okay.  Okay, fine. I'll-I'll think of things.  Okay, j-j-just relax. Uh, uh  Dee   You're sweeter than a bee tle  
 Just say bee.
 Uh, bee.  Right? I didn't think of that.  Uh  You're the honey that the bee makes   You're the   Sugar on the pound carrot   What's a pound carrot?  Go with pound cake.  Cake!  Right, good. Uh  You make life sweet, Dee   You make   Life sweet for I   A-and I   Love you.   Thanks, Charlie.  (lightly chuckles)  You can't rhyme very well, but  (chuckles)  That was  that was really  (laughing): really pathetic. 
 What?
 (laughing)  (laughs)  (laughing): I wrote a couple words on a construction paper,  pink and red, and you sing a heart song for me?!  (shouts)  You made me do it!  Yeah! And you said you loved me! 
 Ew! (Dee laughing)
 You bitch!  Look, that song was derivative of a song I wrote 
 for the waitress, anyway, then.
 Yeah, but guess what?  Frank, grab that anthrax! 
 Grab it! Grab it!
 (Dee screams)  Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!  Stop! Stop! Stop.  What are you what are you guys doing?!  All right, this is nuts! This is crazy!  I mean, I-I-I can't believe we blew another opportunity  to have a working bar.  To have a successful business together!  Because you assholes get so worked up over Valentine's Day,  the dumbest holiday that ever existed!  But I thought you were trying to get us to focus  on ourselves and focus on Valentine's Day.  What?!  Are-are you insane?!  I All I've been saying is to please focus on the bar!  But you just couldn't do it!  Dennis, I got to say, I feel like this is  just about something else.  It's It's not about something else, it's 
 The bar is fine.
 Yup. 
 This is something else is up.
 It's always fine, yeah.  CHARLIE: You know what it is? 
 This is 'cause you hate Valentine's Day.
 It's not because  I hate Valentine's Day. 
 It's because I-I just want
 No, that's what it is. 
 He's trying to distract us from Valentine's Day.
 Mm-hmm. 
 That's it.
 I'm not trying to distract anybody from Valen 
 Yeah, you know why, though, you guys?
 That's the thing, yeah.  It's because he doesn't have any feelings and we do.  Yeah, because we have feelings and you don't,  and that's why you hate Valentine's Day.  Oh, stop! Goddamn it!  I hate Valentine's Day because you assholes never got me anything!  Okay, and I have feelings!  Of course I have feelings!  I have big feelings, okay?!  A-and it hurts.  Okay, so  so that's why I hate Valentine's Day,  and that's why I put anthrax in the box.  That was you?  Yes, it was me.  I just (sighs)  I just wanted it to stop.  Okay? And it's powdered sugar, by the way. 
 Oh, he's already eating it.
 I knew that.  (sighs)  MAC: Dennis.  DENNIS: What?!  I got the crate.  So what?!  Open it.  I'm not gonna open a goddamn crate, Mac!  There's nothing in it!  Just open it.  You want me to open the crate? I'll open the goddamn crate.  If it'll get you to stop focusing on it and get you  to stop focusing on this goddamn Valentine's Day bullshit.  I don't know why you're so excited about this goddamn thing.  There's never anything insi  What is this?  It's a gift.  I got it for you.  For me?  Yeah.  You, uh  You got this for me?  I ordered it off the dark Web.  I wanted it to be a surprise.  Yeah.  And how did you, um (sniffs)  How did you know that I wanted an RPG?  'Cause I know you, man.  Also, you casually mention RPGs, like, a weird amount. 
 Is this true?
 CHARLIE: Yeah. 
 You were talking about rocket launchers today,
 Yeah, you talk about them. 
 I think, yeah.
 DEE: That was today.  This is, uh  this is cool.  I still think Valentine's Day is a bullshit holiday, but, um  (clears throat)  this is nice.  (sighs)  Want to shoot it?  (quietly): Yes.  Where's the rocket?  Yeah, that should be,  uh shit, I there's no rocket. 
 No rocket in there?
 There's no rocket?  Ah, there's no rocket!  They forgot to put the rocket in there!  Dude, I'm so sorry!  Mac, I don't care.  I love it.  You figured out the one thing I wanted more than anything else  in the entire world and you got it for me.  And  it's perfect.  Happy Valentine's Day.  Yeah.  Charlie, let's go get this worm out of my ass. 
 Let's do it, man. All right.
 Okay.                     1  
  
     Stop! Thief!  Come back here!   
 (growling)
 (screaming)    Come back here!    (grunting)    What the hell?    Shit.  You're nothing but a street rat!  I may be a street rat,  but I still got your bread, bitch.  (chuckles)  (groaning)  Excuse me, excuse me, are you, um  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm the suck boy you're looking for.  You want my time, you got to pay to spray.  That's my motto. That and you cannot finish inside me.  No, no, no, Matt. It's me.  Dad?  It's time to come home, son.    You want me to come work for you?  Well, I want you to learn the business.  I'm not getting any younger.  It's time for me to pass the torch. 
 Oh, shit.
 What? 
 You're dying.
 What?  I-I figured. You look like hell.  Hey, has anyone claimed your organs?  (scoffs) I'm not dying, you idiot.  I'm retiring.  Oh. My bad.  I had to ask.  It's a seller's market right now.  Look what you've become.  Do you want to live this way, son?  Covered in manure, selling your body,  smoking PCP or whatever it is you smoke.  Oh, come on.  Do I look like a dusthead to you?  You certainly don't look like my son.  Matthew Mara. You remember him?  Come on.  Give the job a shot, for Christ's sake.  I'll think about it.  I got to pop in here first.  You don't have to go into a dive bar right now.  I'm just gonna clean myself up.  Have a little faith.  My friends have a very nice setup  for me to take a shower in here.  In fact, I'm the type of gal who makes men's lives better.  Hey-o! You guys mind if I shower  in that leaky urinal again? (clicks tongue)  Well, that don't count that.  That's not a good example.  (whistling)  Ah!  (laughs)  Eh. While I'm here, I might as well  do a little P to the C to the P.  (humming)  (chuckles)  Take me to the angels, baby.    (sighs)  DAD: It's time to come home, son.  Maybe it's time to make a change.    All right, uh, this is the loading dock  where we, uh, ship our supplies from.  And right here  this is you. 
 Whoa!
 What are you doing?  This is nice.  I'm gonna sleep well tonight.  No, no. You're not gonna sleep there. Come on.  Get out. Get out of the damn box.  You're gonna sleep at home in a bed. 
 Oh. Eh, too exposed.
 Yeah.  No. I-I'll sleep in, uh, maybe the crawlspace 
 or a cupboard.
 MAN: This is bullshit.  Hey, hey, hey, Davy, Davy. 
 Calm down, Davy.
 He's a homeless junkie, Dad.  I don't even understand why we're doing this. 
 He's just gonna burn you again.
 All right. 
 When did I ever burn Dad?
 You stole his identity. 
 Eight times!
 Well, at least  I didn't wet the bed till I was in high school.  Shut your mouth about that. 
 Whatever, Davy Diapers.
 I will kill you. 
 Try it.
 Hey, hey, hey, hey!  Come on! Take it back!  You want another noogie?  All right, all right, boys. 
 (grunting)
 Boys! Stop it!  His scalp came off on my fingers.  Goddamn it.  Now look here, guys.  We have an important meeting coming up.  It's our biggest account.  And I'm gonna tell them  that my boys are taking over the business.  Both of them.  You guys need to get your shit together.  Got it? Huh? 
 Yes, sir.
 Yes. Yes.  All right.  I got my eye on you, loser.  And you stink like piss, by the way.  It's freakin' bullcrap.  WOMAN: What a jerk.  Huh?  Oh. Yeah.  He's always been a hard-on.  He's the one who stinks, by the way.  His shoes smell like rotten eggs.  You smell his shoes?  Yeah. He kicks at me  if he catches me sleeping at work.  Calls me a bitch, that kind of thing.  Yeah. He treats me like shit, too.  Sorry. I didn't get your name.  Oh. I'm Belle.  Thus the necklace my mother gave me  that I'm currently guilt-wearing.  (laughs) Belle.  That's a nice name.  I'm Cricket, uh, Matthew.  It's nice to meet you, Matthew.  Hey, date!  Um, I'm sorry. What?  Shit. Sorry. Um,  haven't done this in a long time. Uh  would you like to go on a date with me some time?  Yeah. Yeah, I I'd like that. 
 Yeah?
 Mm-hmm. 
 Okay.
 Okay. Bye.  Okay.  Hey, boss? 
 You go by Cricket?
 I do.  Phone's for you. Line two.  Oh, really?  (whistling a tune) 
 Mm. Hello.
 CHARLIE: Cricket! 
 Oh. Cricket.
 (speaking gibberish)  Damn it! How the hell did you guys find me?  A magician never reveals his tricks, Cricks.  Yeah. We did put that pet-tracking device in him.  Well, wait. Don't tell him that.  Wait. You did what? Wait. Did you put a chip in?  Did you put a chip in me?!  Nothing, Cricket. Hey, listen, um, we got a job for you, buddy.  Oh, do you? Well, uh, I'm not doing it. 
 Well, you don't even know what it is.
 Hey! Yeah. Come on, man. 
 You don't know what the job is, Cricket.
 You don't know the job.  Doesn't matter. I know it probably involves hurting me,  degrading me or generally treating me like shit. 
 You're not totally wrong. Yeah.
 Yeah. 
 Cricket, uh, we'll give you five bucks, huh?
 Yeah, five dollars, Cricket.  The answer is no.  All right. Fine. Three dollars.  Well, you don't go down in negotiation. 
 You go up.
 With Cricket, you do.  (indistinct, overlapping dialogue)  Well, now it's $2.50, Crick, so you want the job or not? 
 You know, ticktock.
 Uh, look, guys, um,  I got a new life, so I don't need anything from you. 
 Ugh. Come on. Hey.
 Well, Cricket, 
 everybody needs a little extra cash.
 Yeah. It's money, Cricket!  Well, uh, actually, that is true,  because I I do have a date. 
 Oh. Cricket. Cricket.
 Ah. Well, don't make up a story.  I mean, yeah, we don't care what you're doing with the money.  Hey, dipshit!  We're not paying you to talk on the phone.  Speaking of, I need some cash. When do we get paid?  Paychecks come at the end of the month. Who you talking to, huh?  Your drug dealer?  Your skeezy little arrogant douche bag friends down at the bar? 
 Those guys are my friends!
 Whatever!  I am so onto you.  And I bet you're gonna be high by the end of the night.  (inhaling)  Ooh!  Freakin' bullcrap!  He's getting yelled at.  Well, don't piss off your trick there, Cricket. He might 
 cut you up.
 CHARLIE: Yeah, just  finish the guy off, and then come do the job for us. 
 Yeah.
 All right, what's it gonna be?  We need a decision, Cricket.  Mm  Are we ready to party tonight?  (whooping and cheering) 
 So am I!
 (women gasping and groaning)  Got 'em, everybody got 'em.  
 Dad?
 Oh! Janie? 
 Oh!
 (audience gasping and groaning)  Let's just have a good time and get drunk, huh?  Stuff it down with some brown. 
 Stuff it down with brown.
 (overlapping chatter) 
 Can always stuff it down.
 Hey, good job, fellas.  I loved how you ruined that dad.  Ah. I got to say, it's kind of fun  being on the other end of it sometimes, huh?  (laughs) Okay, time to pay the piper. Who's got the money? 
 Yes.
 Oh, uh, Frank.  Lemons.  What? No. N-No, okay? No, you're not paying me in lemons again.  Okay? Hey, we had an agreement.  You want to get paid in PCP, Cricket? 'Cause you're just 
 gonna spend it on drugs anyway, right?
 Oh, yeah, skip the middleman. 
 Yeah.
 Uh, yeah. You want some dust?  No. Okay, normally, okay?  But now I'm off drugs, and I actually have a date,  so I need the money, I really need the money.  Look, Cricket, I'm sure whatever street mongrel you're dating  she's into lemons, too, so you're good.  Goddamn it. Goddamn you, you are the worst person ever.  And by the way, my name is not Cricket, okay?  My name is Matthew Mara.  I'm a person. A person, by the way, who has a job now.  Yeah. I am going to be running a company soon. 
 Cricks, I love you, but this is so boring.
 You're losing me.  Goddamn it! All right, you know what? Screw you guys. 
 CHARLIE: Hey, Cricket? Cricket? Cricket!
 DEE: Come on.  Cricket, Cricket, calm down, man. Hey, look.  What? 
 You want the lemons or not?
 Unbelievable. 
 Yes, I'm gonna take the lemons. Goddamn it.
 All right, yeah. 
 You guys are the worst.
 He wants the lemons. 
 He needs the lemons.
 The guy loves lemons.  MAC: He needs the lemons for the scurvy. 
 CHARLIE: Yeah, yeah.
 FRANK: He'll be back.  After everything I've done, you know?  After everything they've done to me.  (bell tinkles)  Belle?  What are you doing here?  Promise I'm not stalking you.  I'm just out for a walk.  My dad'll be so worried about me,  but I just had to get out of the house. 
 Ah.
 Ever since my mom died,  I'm kind of all he's got, so he's become a little overbearing.  Yeah, I get that. I got an overbearing dad, too. 
 Yeah.
 My life's the worst.  (groaning)  Um. Ah.  (laughs)  You're so funny.  Okay. 
 And cute.
 Oh, son of a bitch.  Did someone put you up to this? 
 No. Why?
 Look, I am not funny,  and I'm sure as shit not cute.  Nobody put me up to this, okay?  I like you. I do, and  I feel like we have more in common than you think.  (laughs)  Are you thinking what I'm thinking?  Go behind some Dumpster and bang?  I was kind of talking about that date.  Oh. I'm into that.  (guttural groaning)  (Tchaikovsky's "Waltz of the Flowers" playing)      There they are!  (chuckles)  Davy, Pops. (whoops)  I met the most amazing girl.  I'm in love. I'm in love!  And I owe it all to you, Dad,  for giving me a second chance.  Thank you. Now,  let's go in this meeting and show this guy  that he is making the right choice  investing in the Mara brothers!  You missed it, asshole.  Huh?  You missed it. The meeting. We lost the account.  Dad, I told you we couldn't trust him.  Goddamn it, Matt. This was your chance.  Shit. Okay. Um, I'll talk to the guy.  I will make this right, okay?  He's probably down by his car right now.  Carl Lewis couldn't catch him!    I can.    Mr. Sanderson!  Mr. Sanderson!  (panting)  Matthew Mara.  Did you just do a flip off that truck?  Yes, sir. That is how dedicated I am  to keeping your business. Now, look,  I know you have your reservations,  but I'm asking you give us a second chance.  I'm not giving you a second chance. I made my decision. It's final.  Okay. Well, guess I'm gonna have to cut your heart out then.  What did you just say?  I said I guess I'm gonna have to cut  your heart out of your body.  You see, uh,  I'm from the streets.  And I'm about to poke you full of holes.  He'll do it!  What? Well, th-that's great!  What changed your mind, Tom?  Uh, your son here made a compelling argument.  What? Oh. Well, see, he's my boy.  We will not let you down, 
 Mr. Sanderson.
 Uh, D-Davy, 
 don't push. Uh,
 Yes, sir.  Tom, let's discuss this.  Hey.  What?  Maybe I misjudged you.  Maybe you're not  just some homeless junkie.  Maybe you're my brother.  Sorry I said that about Carl Lewis.  (tinkling) 
 Belle.
 Heard me comin', I guess.  I think I just saved the company. (chuckles)  Wow. That's great news for you.  And probably bad news for me.  I'm running away.  I got to see the world.  I was wondering if you might want to come away with me.  I-I can't.  I mean, this is my life now.  Yeah. I understand.  Well, I should go.  Hey, um  could you just help me with my necklace?  I can never seem to get it off.  Sure. 
 Here.
 No, I I want you to keep it.  Something to remember me by.  Well, good-bye, Matthew.  Well, here's something to remember me by.    Jesus, Mary and Joseph, what are you doing?! 
 DAVY: What the hell are you doing?
 I'm making out 
 with the woman I love.
 What the hell  are you talking about? That's Dad's dog.  You're making out with my dog!  Dog?  Oh, shit!  Oh, no.    Maybe it's time to make a change.  Nah, I'm gonna smoke it. 
 I'm Cricket.
 BELLE: I'm Belle. 
 That's a nice name.
 BELLE (echoing): His shoes 
 smell like rotten eggs.
 Lemons. 
 Screw you guys!
 You smell his shoes?  Beauty and the   Beauty   And the beast     Huh.  DAVY: He's gone.  Way to go, Rickety Cricket.  So, you did exactly what I thought you'd do,  you goddamn street rat! 
 Matt, Matt, goddamn it.
 (door closes)  I gave you a shot.  You can't go around  doing insane shit like kissing dogs.  You got to put all that nonsense behind you once and for all.  Now, this is my last and final offer.  You cut that bullshit out and come work with me,  or you go back on the street  and crawl back into that manure pile  I found you in.  So, which is it?  Huh?  (door opens) 
 Hey-o!
 Oh, Cricket! 
 Cricket!
 Hey, hey!  Hey, you guys mind if I go in the bathroom and smoke some PCP? 
 Smoke up, bud.
 Yeah, absolutely, dude. 
 Do what you got to do, man.
 You do you, bud. You do you!  We don't judge, Cricket, we don't judge. 
 Have fun, buddy.
 Go, Cricket.   (trio chanting backwards)                          Happy New Year 2016
 New Year, New Color ;-) My apartment is not a spa. Dennis and I are gonna take a soak. You and Dennis are going to bathe together? It's that Turkish bath thing. What are you worried about? I'm not worried about anything but my apartment is not a Turkish bath, okay? Well, Dee, this is Dennis's apartment now too. No. No, goddamn it, it's not, all right? Mac and Dennis do not live here.
 What the hell is this?
 One more! Stop!
 Hey!
 Good set, boys! What are you doing? Oh, Dee, this is Jojo
 Tiny, Charlie you know.
 I don't care. Together, we are Ass Kickers United. You guys, come on, please. I don't want you doing your weird routines in here! It's not a routine, Dee, and there is nothing weird about this, okay? Ass Kickers United is a way of life based on the life-improvement teachings of the Master. What kind of cult shit is that? No, no, it's not a cult, Frank. The Master is the only human to ever achieve enlightenment through the way of the warrior. Snap, two, three. One, two, seven, three, nine. Come on. Goddamn it! Frank, I can't get this Fight Milk out of the goddamn couch! Oh! Shit! It burned a hole in the cushion! That's probably the crotein. Don't get that on your skin! Hey-oh! Frank! Frank, sorry I'm late, man, but, uh, good news. I brought checkers. Oh, what's up, Dee? I got dominoes, and what the hell is going on? Your place looks like shit.
 What happened?
 Yeah, it does. I'll tell you what happened. Mac and his goddamn Ass Blasters Incorporated were in here jerking around all day. Mac, Charlie and a bunch of goons started a queer club.
 Hmm.
 They got a newsletter. Oh, shit. "Ass Kickers United."
 Oh, my God.
 What?
 Dee, Mac didn't start this club. I did.
 What are you talking about? Yeah. I, uh I just made this shit up about Ass Kickers United to get Mac to stop eating my Thin Mints.
 Huh?
 You know how Mac is all irritating and shit?
 Of course.
 The worst! Right. He was doing all this irritating shit and he was driving me crazy. Worst of all, he was eating all my Thin Mint cookies and, so, you know, playing on Mac's physical insecurities I decided I would get in his head a little bit. So I created this Master character, all right? I typed up this newsletter which was mostly about fitness and, like, just kicking ass at life in general, just kind of speaking Mac's language. But mostly, I was speaking of the dangers of consuming too many Thin Mint cookies. And I'll tell you, it worked like a charm 'cause he stopped eating Thin Mints almost immediately.
 That is extremely impressive.
 Oh. Dennis, I missed most of that last part. Run it by me again. Frank, I just spoke for five straight minutes. I'm not doing it again.
 Dennis started a cult.
 No, I didn't start a cult. Sure sounds like a cult. Hey, I got a great idea. Why don't you type up another newsletter and tell Mac and his dum-dum friends to go and fix up your apartment, right? That way, you guys can get out of my place. Or maybe get some broads involved. Cults are great for attracting new age tail. Guys, you can't go straight to fixing apartments and getting young, new age tail. You can't do that. That takes years of brainwashing. Here's the problem. If you don't do that and write the newsletter and fix up the apartment, then I'm gonna rat you out.
 Come on.
 I'm gonna have to. You know why? I'm up to here. I've had a very bad day! I'm at the end of my rope
 Okay, Dee, calm down.
 If I'm being honest. All right, look, I'll test the waters a little bit, okay? See if we can get 'em there slowly. Maybe you can get 'em to eat a shit sandwich. That would be fun. Why the hell would I What? No, this isn't about fun. This is about It's about Thin Mints, goddamn it! Right? And the reason I'm so good at this is because I take it seriously. Now, just watch and learn. Listen up! According to the Master, guys we're not getting enough vitamin D. So these stickers harness the power of the sun and deliver it directly to our bodies, okay? And, apparently, guys, there's another exercise. Yes, sensei! All right, now, they're called hammer jerks and it's sort of like a hammer, then you bend.
 Then you snap, then you jerk.
 Ow.
 Then a hammer.
 Hammer!
 Now bend!
 Bend.
 Snap.
 Damn it.
 Jerk.
 Oh, yeah. Hammer, bend, snap jerk. Hammer I can't believe they went for the sticker thing. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, time to dial it up a notch. Let's put 'em to work and get 'em to your apartment. We can't just dive into that shit. We talked about this. It's a slow burn. They're wearing stickers on their heads. They're there. Look, look, look, stop. You guys are going crazy. You're gonna blow the Thin Mint thing. Will you just trust me? I got this. I am the Master. I'm gonna get you what you want. You just got to let me do my thing.
 That sounds That sounds good.
 Mm, yeah, okay.
 You gonna goddamn blow this for me?
 No.
 You gonna blow the Thin Mint thing?
 No.
 "The Master saith."
 Yeah. "Kicking ass in life is all about drywall." And pussy. Put "pussy." Goddamn, Frank, don't say "pussy."
 It's disgusting. I'm not putting it.
 Mmm. "To be a total badass
 you must learn carpentry.
 Mmm. Fixing apartments is what you must do." And buy Wolf Cola. Let's make some coin. Okay. "And buy Wolf Cola, the only cola for true refreshment." That's good.
 "Splash into the beast."
 Mm-hmm, that's great. I know it is. Cool it with the jerky, will you? You're driving me nuts.
 Now, put-put "bring pussy."
 Goddamn it. All right, fine.
 Just put it.
 Hey, listen! This is what I'll do. "Ladies are now mandatory. Each of you dick-bags must recruit at least one woman." Should we put anything else?
 Make 'em eat a shit sandwich.
 What is it with you? Do you really want to see somebody take a roll and stick doody in it and put it in their mouth?
 God! You are so gross.
 Nah. Okay, so, how much for the Wolf Colas?
 Five bucks apiece.
 Okay, great. Ma, how many you want? I'll take three. Okay. And Mrs. Mac?
 Sh-She'll have one.
 Huh? One. Any more caffeine than that, and she will not stop talking. Really? Oh, kind of want to see that. Charlie, can I talk to you for a second?
 Yeah. What's up?
 Um, does all this seem kind of strange to you? Huh? Uh Oh! You mean the Wolf Cola thing? Yeah. I was wondering. Like, how does the Master know about Wolf Cola? Oh, he's an aficionado of all beverages. He's gonna know the finest of colas. Oh, oh. You mean the carpentry thing. Yeah. No. Throughout history, uh, Ass Kickers have always known carpentry.
 Jesus Christ, Harrison Ford.
 Right, okay.
 Then what are you talking about?
 The women. The women, dude. This is supposed to be a men's club, you know? Who wants that around? Oh. Uh I don't know. I'm kind of cool with it. Also, I don't ever remember anything in the newsletters about no women. It could not have been more clear no women, no gays. I don't ever remember you reading anything about that. It was implied, okay? Look, in these kind of texts, you need to be able to in infer what's be Look, I'll explain it to you later. I think I'm just gonna I need some time off. Whoa. Hey, man, you can't take a day off from kicking ass, okay? Look, an Ass Kicker must be present every day. An Ass Kicker must do the exercises. An Ass Kicker must avoid Thin Mints. I know the rules, okay? I don't need to I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go. I'm just gonna go.
 You're just gonna go?
 I mean I mean Okay, I'm taking the men with me, and Frank's got the women. Oh, cool. Are you an Ass Kicker now?
 I'm an Ass Kicker now.
 Sweet. Who signed you up?
 The dumb one.
 Oh, Tiny? No, no, no. The one eating paint chips off the wall. These taste like paint. Uh, yeah, those are paint chips there, pal.
 These are?
 Yeah.
 Oh, they're delicious.
 Yeah, that's the good paint. Let's go. All right, let's go. Hey, we're gonna, uh, go swing some hammers. Oh, you guys, it's so great that you do construction. I mean, this is just gonna be easy just slap a couple coats of paint around, maybe a couple of new doors.
 You're gonna be in and out in a few hours.
 Yeah. Ha Oh! Wow! Shit.
 No wall! That's pretty awesome.
 Okay, boys, let's get to work.
 Yeah.
 Look, I do construction for a living. I mean, I thought Ass Kickers was just some sort of fun workout club, you know, like
 CrossFit.
 CrossFit. Hey, man, you don't want to take this seriously? Hey, that's fine. Why don't you give me those stickers back then? Uh, no, I'm coming down with a cold and I need mine. Did you do, like, your deer antler spray? Some. But I'm running lower. Have some of mine. Here. All right, you know what? I overreacted, boys. I overreacted. I snapped at you, and the Master wouldn't like that. And I'm sorry. I think maybe this is my mission and my calling. So why don't you guys find some other mission and I'll handle this one, okay?
 Thanks, Charlie.
 All right, cool.
 Good luck.
 Thank you.
 Goddamn it, Charlie.
 It's fine. You know, the guys have been working their asses off. I got this. Look. Dee, the Master says fix it? I'm gonna fix it. Frank, is that you? Missed you in there, pal. Still pretty steamy though if you want to hop in and
 What the hell's this?
 Just watching a little TV.
 Are those Thin Mints?
 Oh, yeah, big-time, dude. I love these things. I notice, uh, you're looking a little out of shape there, bud. I am? Yeah. Yeah, and it's a shame too because you've been looking so great lately. So sexy.
 I was?
 Yeah, so to see this is just disappointing. To me, but, you know
 This disappoints you?
 Yeah. What are you doing? You taking a day off or something? Is that okay? I'm sure the Master allows for that though, right?
 Well, I'm not really sure about that.
 Oh, you're not sure, yeah. Did the Master not make that crystal goddamn clear in all those newsletters?
 Was that not clear?
 I-I didn't read into it like that. Wow, wow. I mean, I haven't read the things, but I've just You guys have been telling me. Thin Mints, from what I understand that was a whole thing.
 I think that was, like, rule number
 Oh, shit. I Yeah. I-I I-I may have I messed up a little bit. I hope he doesn't notice the fat that I'm noticing sort of accumulated all over. But maybe he won't notice. I noticed, but maybe he won't.
 Y-You don't think he would, or
 No, I think he will. Uh, do you mind if I use the computer? I'm just gonna grab this and take it over here for a little bit, okay? Mmm. And snap it back! Bend and snap. How's that neck, Cindy? Everything good? How are the muscles? You feeling okay?
 You may want to soak 'em a little bit.
 Actually, I feel great.
 Oh, you feel great.
 Frank, I'm in tremendous pain. I'm not talking to you. I'm talking to her. I can't breathe. Oh, she needs a cigarette break. Could we stop, please? I don't care what she needs. I'm not talking to you. Do whatever you want. I'm trying to hurt her. What? Uh, well, it's it I'm You have to tear the fascial tissues in order to tone the muscles properly.
 Oh.
 According to the Master.
 Okay.
 So you bend and you snap. But snap your head back. Bend. You see it?
 Frank?
 And snap!
 Frank, Frank, Frank. We need to talk.
 Yo, Cindy, you keep working.
 Go ahead. Snap it.
 Okay, you got it. Hey, listen. We gotta make a bit of an adjustment. Tiny and Jojo, they don't want to do the construction so I was looking into what cults do to force people into labor when the mind tricks don't work, and one of them was a personality test, right? You basically just get a bunch of dirt on people and you hold it over their heads. So, blackmail. Yeah. So this is a basic personality test. It's really simple. It just measures the amount of guilt stressors that you're feeling. You know, I took it, and I just It's changed my life. What are guilt stressors? Yeah, Dee, what what are guilt stressors? Oh, great question. Great question. Apparently, secrets and lies lead to guilt stressors and that's not good, you guys. You know why? It impedes muscle development.
 I have read that.
 Oh, really?
 Well, it's science. It's just basic science.
 Oh, shit. It does sound like good science. You guys just hang on to that machine and talk about all your regrets. And what are regrets again? Y-You just talk about things you feel really guilty about.
 Oh.
 Oh, okay. Uh, okay.
 Do you want to
 I'll go. Dee, where do my feet go?
 Oh, it doesn't matter.
 Okay, uh I ate a baby toad once. I'm not proud of it. Uh, just kind of happened.
 It pains me to think about how scared and confused it was
 Mm-hmm. And wondering, "Why am I not home and why am I in some sort of acid pond that's burning my skin?" What if it was looking for its mother? It was a baby. I got an idea. How about we let one of these guys, uh, give it a shot.
 I'll go.
 I don't feel better, but all right.
 Where do my feet go?
 Dee, his feet?
 It doesn't make a goddamn difference.
 Okay.
 I ate a toad too.
 Oh, God.
 Really?
 I did.
 Do it again, like that?
 Yeah, do it again.
 Go ahead.
 Whoo! Oh, I feel the burn. Yeah, how's how's the neck feeling? How's the neck? You know, it's not bad.
 It's actually a little tight.
 It's a little tight. Well, how about if we hop in the healing pool.
 Okay.
 I'll give you some touch therapy so you don't seem too weak for the Master.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I don't suppose that could hurt.
 No, that won't hurt. Oh, shit. Oh, hi. The water's wonderful.
 When did you get in here?
 You don't mind that we came in first, do you?
 There's plenty of room.
 No, how long are you gonna be? Well
 Oh, God.
 She thinks she has a tear in her uterine wall so it might be a while. All right. L-Let's go. Oh, God. I'm gonna go do a few sets of kettle pops while I run the block a few times.
 Yeah.
 Don't want to disappoint the Master.
 You want to come?
 Go You go get yourself good and banged up.
 Okay!
 Oh, yeah. Guys, guys, guys, there's been a mistake, a terrible mistake. I got a new newsletter from the Master. There's gonna be no more women, no more Wolf Cola and no more carpentry in Ass Kickers United. This has all been a test designed by the Master to figure out who the true believers are. I passed, you failed, and that's why I'm going to level two. Oh, also, uh, Dennis will be level two as well but he'll be directly under me. Wh-What? Where'd you get that from?
 It was implied in the newsletter.
 No. How is Dennis in level two? Or an Ass Kicker, for that matter?
 Oh, he bought in.
 He bought in? Come on, Ass Kickers, let's get out of here
 before we're tainted by these disgusting women.
 Mm-hmm. All right. God, crazy. Failed that test. Go kick some ass, huh? Go kick some ass!
 Hmm.
 Thought you could outmaster the Master, idiots? So you swayed 'em back. Uh, whatever. We can do that too. Dee, you think this is easy? You need years of practice to even sniff my talent for manipulation. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a cult that needs a charismatic leader. Yeah. Goddamn it, Frank. Goddamn it! No. No, we cannot let him get away with this. No, this is about something different now, something much more important.
 Shit sandwich?
 What? Why? What is that? No! God. No, this is about control now. This is about control, and it's about beating Dennis. Mmm. I know exactly what we need to do. Hmm. Deandra, we're all set.
 Yeah?
 Yeah.
 He's out?
 He's lit. I have so much alcohol in here. I gave him three bottles of Fight Milk. Whoa. That's a lot. Okay, you ready? Got your cards?
 Okay.
 Okay. Here we go. Charlie. Charlie.
 Say it louder.
 Charlie, wake up! Huh? What's What's What's happening? It is I the Master!
 Am I dreaming?
 You're having a vision.
 Am I peeing?
 Uh
 Is he peeing?
 Just read the card. You and the other Ass Kickers must con con What's that word?
 Congregate.
 "Congregate"? What does that mean? It doesn't matter. Just say it. Congregate.
 What does that mean?
 Oh, God. You know what? Just Hey, Charlie, hey. Get all the Ass Kickers together and meet at Mac and Dennis's apartment, okay? Lord Zolo is gonna get you on the mother ship. Lord Zolo? Charlie, you've graduated to the next level. Congratulations. And your reward is to get to know all the secrets of the universe. Yeah, there's just a few things you have to do. Okay. I'll do them. I'm peeing.
 Uh-oh.
 Oh. Okay, you guys Holy shit! Whoa! What the hell happened in here? You like it? Yeah, well, before Master Rex said that we weren't supposed to do carpentry I talked to Tiny and Jojo and they got their construction crew in here.
 There's a wall.
 Oh, you're goddamn right there's a wall. I'm good. Dennis is gonna shit his pants. Why? What are you good at? Good at my I'm a good person, and you know what? It's time to to do the plan that the Master laid out, right? I'm gonna take Tiny in the other room and make the pods ready.
 Come on, Tiny.
 We got pods? Of course we got pods. Lord Zolo's gonna take you guys on that mother ship with him. You need pods.
 Am I right, Master?
 Do Do I get a pod? Okay, guys, guys, guys, we got a Uh, wow. Holy shit.
 That's a wall.
 Yeah. This place looks great. You're goddamn right this place looks great. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's pretty impressive stuff, Dee, but, uh it doesn't seal the deal. I've got an announcement. I've got some big news here. The Master texted me while we were on our way over here. Oh, interesting. Uh, I wonder how it's possible that the Master could've texted you when he's been here with us the whole time. Rex is the Master?
 That makes so much sense.
 Yep. Yes. Of course I know that Rex is the Master, and of course I would never question the word of someone so wise. But I actually got a text from the Supreme Overlord Master. And that's Rex's master.
 Oh, shit.
 "Oh, shit" is right, you guys. That's He's the big guy. He sits right at the tippy-tippy-top, and he made it very, very clear to me that all of you are going to need to commit suicide. Tits! I knew it! The final circle. Yeah, okay, sure, but hang on a second.
 Can I please talk to you for just a quick second?
 Sure. Why don't you guys get yourselves lathered up in lighter fluid and, uh, you're gonna get ready to light yourselves ablaze.
 Thanks for trusting me.
 Yeah, of course. I did it. I won. I am the most charismatic leader. I got Tiny to eat a shit sandwich.
 Ugh!
 Oh! Goddamn it! I got him to eat a poopy. You idiot! I got these guys to think they were going to another dimension.
 I'm the winner.
 Are you kidding me? They were gonna light themselves on fire for me. I'm the winner.
 Oh.
 Guys, guys, hang on a second. The winner of what? The The Ass Kickers, okay? The winner of the Ass Kickers. It's mine. It's not theirs.
 What?
 It's mine. The whole thing's made up. I made it up. Master Rex, is this true? Oh, don't ask Rex. What The fire is started. Thank you so much for trusting me with this. This is good-bye!
 Goddamn it! No, not again!
 Don't do it!
 Whoa!
 Run! Hey! We'll get you some help, okay?
 We'll call the fire department.
 Oh, God.
 Yeah.
 And then we'll go to Dee's.
 No, no, no. Can't we go anywhere else?
 No, Dee. What if the Supreme Overlord tries to contact us?
 He has to know where we are.
 Yeah, exactly. All right, well, at least he's on the mother ship now.
 Yeah.
 Oh, my God! Unbelievable! Come on, let's go. Get help. Let's go. Good luck, Jojo! Thank you! Aah! Happy New Year 2016
 New Year, New Color ;-)                       1 DENNIS: Okay, so there we were.  We're in the brig and the whole ship just,  you know, bumps; we get thrown against the the wall.  Yeah. You know, the-the lights are going off.  The sirens are blaring. Whoa, whoa.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  How did we get in the brig in the first place?  What do you mean, Frank? You were there.  I'm very cloudy about the beginning.  I think I need a recap.  Recap? A recap would be good, you know?  Just to kind of brush up on everything that happened.  A recap Now, see, I forgot that.  honestly might be good because, you know,  we want him to be completely clear  before the final judgment.  All right, you know, Right, yeah.  the amount of energy we're using talking  about whether or not we should recap,  we may as well just recap, so fine, fine.  So there we were. We're on a Christian cruise.  Yeah, we're all thrown in the brig  for various sins that we committed.  Me, admittedly, for a little bit of lust.  Um, and in summation, we're all good people,  asking for forgiveness.  My thing, not a rape.  Move on; you're losing him.  Move on; you're losing him. I just want to be clear.  Okay, yeah, yeah. I just wanted to be clear.   (alarm blaring, thunder crashes)  What the hell is that?  What're those sirens for?  Oh, God. Oh, my God, see, I knew  I shouldn't have come on this cruise.  I knew it! I mean, it used to be I would never even leave Philly!  And then, you know, you guys drag me to this,  you drag me to that, and next thing I know,  I-I'm stuck in a box on a sinking ship!  Hold on, the boat's not sinking. How do you know that?  How do you know it's not?  (alarm stops)  Well Oh.  There you go. It stopped.  All right, uh, I guess that's good.  I mean, like like, if something went wrong,  they-they'd come down here, they'd get us, right?  You know what, guys, what difference does it make?  You know?  Life is just a series of events  with no meaning or plan, you know?  It's like, we live, we die,  we're gay, we're straight, we're tops, we're bottoms.  Wait, wait, wait. Calm down, everybody.  We're gonna be in the Bahamas in an hour.  Well, you sure? Like, I I don't think we're moving.  We're moving. I can hear the engine buzzing like crazy.  No, I think Charlie's right.  I-I don't think that we're moving, and-and besides,  the buzzing would be, like, an electrical system.  You know? The engine sounds more like  (imitating a motor boat)  Yeah, maybe on a speedboat. This is a big cruise ship.  It's got like a big, deep sound; it's like a  (imitating engine starting)  Yeah, if you're starting the engine, but, like,  we would be hearing a steady  Gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah  DENNIS: No, no, you guys are all wrong.  No, boats are mostly computerized these days,  so the engine barely makes any noise at all.  I mean, they-they make a fake noise  to-to make people feel better, but it's like (deep humming)  But it's fake, it's not it's not real, you know?  It's kind of like how I carry a little piece of onion  around with me to elicit tears, you know,  in case someone needs me to feel something  about what they said or are doing, you know what I mean?  Do you have an onion in your pocket right now? No.  No, I'm taking a vacation from myself.  W-Was it a vacation from hearing, okay?  'Cause if the engine was going, we would hear a gah, gah, gah,  gah, gah, gah, gah Are you deaf, Charlie?  I was like (imitating motor boat)  (all doing different engine imitations)  I mean, that's ridiculous! All right, okay, all right. All right, all right, all right!  Goddamn! Okay, look.  Let's just, let's all agree  that it doesn't sound like a speedboat,  or something that's off-roading, all right?  It does make a little bit of a buzz.  Yeah?  But most modern ships these days, their engines,  they don't make a lot of noise,  that they do make a little bit of noise.  Can we all just agree on this?  Yeah. Fine, I can live with that.  I can live with it. Fine.  Okay, all right. (groans)  How long have we been talking about this?  Four hours, six minutes.  (Frank whistles, groans)  Well, there's some pros and some cons, guys.  Pro: We've cut our conflict resolution time in half.  Four hours, that's good for us.  That's-that's huge, that's huge.  Con: Charlie's right, the ship is probably not moving  because we definitely would've been in the Bahamas by now.  What?  Yep. Oh.  Well, that's not good, right? I mean  No. It's not good.  I mean, f-four hours?  Well The-the boat not moving!  No one comes down to say anything like,  "Hey, guys, there's something wrong with the ship!"  No, they've forgotten about us!  And we're gonna die in here! Oh, my God, I'm freaking out.  We got to get out of here. Help! Help!  Calm down, Charlie.  Help us! Charlie!  You got to help! Hey! Hey!  Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi!  Mm, yep, yep, yep. Mm.  Whoa. Yeah?  Yep. Oi, oi, oi.  What-what was that, dude?  You sound like a soccer hooligan.  Uh, yeah, that's just something I've been doing  with Charlie lately when he gets a little wound up.  You know, it seems to work.  Say yup, yup, yup. FRANK: Oh, that's good.  The most important thing for us to do now  is to keep our wits together.  We got to occupy ourselves. Mm-hmm.  Why don't we play a few games?  No, no! I just wanted to get away from you guys,  just for a few days.  Now we're stuck in a box,  and you're gonna play some games now?  You know what? I'm out.  What?  What the hell do you mean you're out?  I'm out. Nobody talk to me. MAC: No, Dee.  That's not a very good idea.  You know when my dad was in solitary confinement,  I used to write to him every day to see how it was.  He never wrote back, but if he did, he would've said,  "Son, you've got to keep your mind active.  Also, I love you."  DENNIS: Uh, are you sure he wouldn't say,  "Remind me who you are again"?  Ho! (laughing)  That was great! That was Luther!  My-my-my dad knows who I am. Yeah-yeah.  Hey-hey do the voice again, but this time say,  "I love you, son." Nah.  Oh. But, no, that's  a good distraction, like, um, you know,  like any kind of impressions you got, like any kind of  You want to hear me do a couple of impressions?  That'd be fun. Yeah, okay, so let's see.  All right, so let me know which ones you want to hear.  I'm sorry, Dee, I thought you were sitting out.  Well, I was out, but then these guys wanted to hear  some impressions, and since I'm always wanting to be of service,  here I am, uh They don't want to hear your impressions.  They want to hear my impressions. No.  Your impressions are terrible.  Are you out of your mind? No.  My impressions are fantastic.  Give me somebody. Anybody.  Do Obama.  Obama? Well, I can't do that.  Why not? Yeah.  DENNIS: Why can't you do Obama?  'Cause he's a black man and I'm a white woman.  Can you give me a white woman?  You think I can't do a black woman?  (laughs): I mean  No.  I okay, give me, name one.  C.C.H. Pounder.  Who's that? C.C.H. Poun  Yeah. The actress from The Shield.  Love that show. Okay, yeah.  No, I can do that. Yeah.  Let's see.  (imitating C.C.H. Pounder): Goddamn it, Dutch!  What other errands do you have us running for the D.A.?  BOTH: Wow!  FRANK: Holy shit!  That was great!  That was spot on!  Thanks, man. "Spot on"?  You don't even know who she is, Frank.  I just assumed she's a no-nonsense  black broad from the precinct.  DENNIS: That's exactly who she is. That's exactly who she is.  (all clamoring)  Fine, fine, fine. I'll do Obama, okay?  Okay.  Okay, what do you got?  Hey, yo, what up, son?  What's up wit' Congress bein' all  up in my ass and shit, brother?  Oh! Oh!  Oh, my God, Dee. FRANK: That is bad!  What are you doing?  That was so racist.  Are you kidding me?! CHARLIE: Very racist!  Deandra, he is the President of the United States.  That's our president. DEE: Well, hold on a second.  Why was that racist, but what he did was fine?  Because that's not what Obama sounds like, Dee. That's why.  Uh okay, well, you know, I-I'm just warming up.  Let me, let me try again. Um  Hey, yo, where my senators at, dawg?  Oh! Oh!  Oi, oi, oi, oi! Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi!  Welcome to my first ever dinner party.  I'm gonna have lots of these types of functions  in the future, you know, with my new lifestyle. (chuckles)  Wow, you're really just diving right into that, huh?  Just, stereotypes and all.  Guys, we are gonna have an imaginary meal. Mmm.  I read about this. Yes.  If you truly believe it, then it will make you full. That's true.  Okay. Can I have a broad with me with big tits?  No, because that's gonna force us  to imagine things that we don't want to imagine.  Ah, good point. So get rid of my dog?  Yeah, no dogs.  Go! Go! Hey, get out of here!  So kick it. Get, get, get!  Kick it in the skull. Kick it in the skull.  We do not allow dogs in our house, right, Dennis?  Wh? Our house? Wh-Why's it our house?  Okay, let's get started.  Let me let me set the scene: the food.  The menu. Okay, all right. Ooh, yeah, start with the food.  Yeah, yeah, let's get to it. Okay, all right, here we go.  Paint a nice picture for us, all right? I'm starving.  All right, now you're gonna start  with, like, a big hunk of chicken.  You know, like, boiled and skinless, or-or whatever.  CHARLIE: Huh. Ugh.  DENNIS: Okay.  And then, um, you're gonna want brown with the white, right?  So, like, maybe, like, um, some, like, brown rice.  No no butter or-or seasoning or  Really?  I want mashed potatoes.  No, no mashed potatoes; that's just empty carbs.  Why can't we just imagine whatever we want?  Because this is my dinner party.  Well, then take us there! Yeah!  All right! All right, okay.  Everybody's got something to drink.  Is it a milkshake?  No!  No, not milkshakes.  Gatorade.  And it's gonna be  my favorite flavor: blue.  "Blue" is not a flavor.  How am I gonna taste blue?  Well, just imagine what blue tastes like.  It does It just tastes like blue.  Let's just dig in. Yeah, can we eat?  CHARLIE: Yeah, can we eat?  All right. Yes.  All right.  Mine's kind of tough.  D-Did you overcook this?  No, I didn't cook it at all.  Y-You (spits)  Spit it out! It's raw! You're gonna get sick!  Spit it out, man, spit it out! No, no, don't spit it out!  What are you guys doing? You don't need to spit it out.  For the love of God.  Look, just imagine that it tastes good, okay?  Look at Dennis, see?  Oh, I'm not I'm not imagining your meal.  No, I'm imagining a lovely coq au vin.  Braised with lardons and mushrooms.  I want that! Yeah.  Well, then have it-- it's right in front of you.  As is your buxom date, Frank.  Ah, come here, baby.  Oh, hey!  She got her foot in my raw chicken!  Get your hooker's foot out of my chicken, man! No, no, no, no.  No dates, no coq au vin, no hookers.  Stop ruining this! We're not ruining this.  (imitates buzzing)  What the hell is that?!  Oh, this? It's the sound  of my blender cranking milkshakes.  Anybody want one? (resumes buzzing)  Shit, I'll take a milkshake. Yeah. CHARLIE: I'll have a milkshake.  FRANK: I'll take one. That is not what blenders sound like, Dee.  No! Don't leave my table! Crash!  Hey! What are you doing?  I'm flipping the table! Smash! Crash! Oh!  Now I'm breaking a plate! Boom! Smash! Oh, man.  DENNIS: What the hell, dude?!  Oh, that was really uncalled for. That's nice.  Nothing is working, all right?  You know what, I want you guys to just  Everybody just be quiet.  Why don't we just try not talking for a while?  I'm fine with that. Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, that'll be the first time ever.  (ship creaking)  (coin clinks)  (sniffs)  (coin clinks)  (grunts) (groans)  (coin clinks, hands smack rhythmically)  Shh! Of course.  (coin clinking, hands smacking rhythmically)  (Frank grunting to rhythm)  Yeah.  (rhythmic noises continue)  Okay.  MAC: Okay.  MAC: Okay.  ALL: Ha!  (chuckles)  Well, that was lame.  So stupid. So stu  I hated that show, Stomp.  Ugh, I hate rhythm. H-H-Hang on. Hang on.  D-Dee, what was that?  Well, I-I thought we were all doing,  like, a Stomp thing.  That-that bench, you opened that bench.  What's inside there?  Oh. That opens? Yes.  Maybe there's food in there.  Is there food in there?  Uh, no, just  Just this water gun.  That's not a water gun, man, that's a flare gun,  which I'll hold onto for safekeeping.  Uh  Why?  Well, because I'm the most responsible person.  Uh, guys, guys, I-I don't think any of us should have a gun.  Yeah. Yeah.  Well, one of us does, so  the end.  Charlie, Charlie, let me have the gun.  Back up, Frank. Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.  Don't come close to me. Whoa. Charlie, calm down.  "Calm down, Charlie"?  We're trapped on a sinking ship, okay?  We're gonna die in here.  I don't know what you guys are capable of.  I will hold the gun, thank you very much.  Wait a second, Charlie, the the boat's not sinking, okay?  It's-it's just stopped. Right. Right, it's okay.  Everything's gonna be all right  as long as everybody remains calm.  What the hell is that?  (loud rumbling)  (groaning) DEE: Oh, my God!  What's going on?  Wh-What was that?  MAC: Oh, this is bad.  This is really bad.  Let's think.  CHARLIE: If the room's on its side,  does that mean the boat's on its side? Or  Yeah, that's what it means! (all shouting)  I don't know how boats this big work. All right.  (all yelling for help)  Help us! This is bad!  This is very bad!  All right, we got to get up there and try that door again.  Maybe that lodged something loose.  Get up there? How are we supposed to reach?  Oh! What about a human pyramid?  Yes. Yes, Mac, a human pyramid.  All right, you and I will be the bottoms.  Why? 'Cause I'm gay?  (sighs) Not because you're gay, dumb-ass!  Because we're the strongest.  Damn it. All right, and, Frank, Charlie,  you'll be on us.  And, Dee, you'll be on the very top.  DEE: Okay. Okay, I'll be a bottom now,  but in real life, just to be clear, I'm gonna be a top.  Okay, fine, when you're having gay sex, you can be on the top.  But for now we're on the bottom.  Damn it, the door is locked!  We're done for! We're gonna die in here! DENNIS: Hey, Frank.  Frank, get yourself together! We're gonna die in here!  Stop losing your shit! All right, relax!  Nobody's dying! DEE: That's right.  Just listen to Charlie; he seems to have  his head straight. Calm down.  'Cause we're already dead.  Come again?  I figured it out.  We're dead. We died.  And I don't know when it happened.  It might have might have happened on the cruise ship.  It might have happened on the drive to the cruise ship.  You were going awful fast, Dennis.  (ship creaking) I don't know.  Maybe it happened weeks ago in the bar,  in some sort of colossal and awesome event, I would imagine,  but we're dead, and we're in hell.  We're just being toyed with here.  Or-or m-maybe we're not in hell yet.  You know, maybe this is purgatory,  and we're on our way to be judged.  And soon, oh, boy.  (chuckles)  Yeah, soon, we'll really be in hell.  Won't that be something.  Charlie, calm down. It's-it's gonna be fine, okay?  We can't be freaking out every five minutes.  Now, look, if we work together, everything's gonna be fine.  We're gonna get out of here.  Nah, we're already dead.  I'll prove it. (gun cocks)  (echoing): No!  (groans)  Oh, I think he's coming to.  CHARLIE: Oh, shit, that hurt.  FRANK: Oh, easy. (Charlie groans)  Well, I guess that means we're alive, huh?  Yeah, guess we are. Guess we are, Charlie.  Good, well, then maybe everything's gonna be okay.  Uh, no, pal, we're in deep shit here.  Oh, shit! Take it easy. Okay, take it easy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's not good. It's not good.  Oh.  DEE: As long as, um,  we're not gonna get out of here--  and it looks like that's sort of where this is headed--  is it okay if I just confess something,  get it off my chest before we die?  That's a good idea.  We shouldn't die holding things in about ourselves.  Go ahead, Dee.  Mac owns a Cowboys jersey.  I saw him wearing it in the back office.  What? Uh What?!  That's a secret, Dee! What are you  Don't say it's Romo. Of course it's Romo!  Who else would it be? Oh, my God!  (screaming)  MAC: I'm sorry.  You don't think he deserves to be MVP?!  You son of a bitch. He's constantly overlooked!  You are a traitor!  How many Super Bowls have the Birds won?  Oh, shut up!  Go Birds! (caws)  Oi, oi, oi! Okay, you know what?  I've got something I want to confess.  Charlie changes Frank's prescription on his glasses  to keep Frank dependent on him.  Whoa! Why the hell you blowin' up my spot, man?!  DENNIS: Wow. Uh, I'm sorry, Frank.  All right, fine.  Well, as long as we're "tattling,"  uh, Dennis ripped up all the letters  that your dad wrote from prison,  so you know. (chuckles)  What?  My dad has been writing?  Dennis, is that true?  Yeah, man, but you were just gonna be, like,  talking about it all the time,  and then your dad was probably gonna come to our house  and, like, try to kill us or eat our butts.  You know? I'm trying to protect you, dude! And me.  Does he still write?  Well, no, pal, 'cause you never wrote him back.  (sighs)  But, hey, if it makes you feel any better,  I-I read all those letters,  and he never once said that he loved you.  He just mostly wanted you to send him,  like, pornographic magazines and put drugs in your butt hole.  (sighs)  I can't believe you're saying  I could've had a relationship with my dad.  But you ruined it.  (scoffs)  Normally, I would attack you, but  I-I don't have any fight left.  DENNIS: Wow.  Well, shit, man. I  I I hurt ya.  I can see that.  And, uh  you know, it was it was wrong of me.  Oh, God, I'll tell you  I see how much pain you're in right now.  It's just  (sniffles)  it's tearing me up inside.  (sobbing) Jesus, Dennis, you're crying.  (crying): Well, yeah.  I mean, you've turned me into a blubbering fool here,  because I've hurt  not just my friend  (sobs)  but my brother.  I've hurt my brother.  Onion! I just saw it! Onion!  He's got an onion there! Aw, I knew it!  He's got an onion!  You are such an asshole. I  Now I gotta tell you!  I got a confession.  What is it, Frank?  I was at Chappaquiddick.  The girl, Teddy Kennedy,  the bridge, the car  I played a major role.  Jesus, Frank, we're not doing confessions.  We're doing tattling. Keep up.  DENNIS: You know what? It's all right, it's okay.  Guys, let's just  let's stop fighting, okay?  No more confessions,  no more tattling on each other, all right?  Look, guys,  let's just try to enjoy  these last moments we've got together.  Okay? Or these last hours.  Or, hell it could even be days.  God, we're gonna drown.  I'm too young to drown!  We should die thinking good thoughts.  Yeah. For me,  that's Romo connecting with Dez Bryant.  Oh, stop it! You traitor!  You son of a bitch!  Shut your mouth!  Guys, guys, guys, don't fight.  Don't fight, come on.  Oh, we're not good people;  we can't even die peacefully.  Yeah.  Amazing grace   How sweet the sauce   Sauce? That made   It's not "sauce."  Look, you gotta get the words right,  otherwise Jesus is gonna know we're trying to trick him.  Jesus isn't gonna listen to us.  He's just not, 'cause we're bad people.  But if he's gonna listen to anybody, he might listen to Mac.  Mac, you've been talking to him your whole life.  Mac He knows you!  He doesn't even know who I am.  Save us! Mac, save us.  Guys, guys  there is no God. Oi!  Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi! Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi!  Okay, okay, okay.  One last shot.  Uh, dear Heavenly Father  Yeah.  if you do exist, and you are listening,  if you could find it in your heart  to send us a miracle  Just send us one miracle, please.  One miracle.  Our goose is cooked!  I'm going down.  Highway to hell, baby!  Sis I love you.  Whatever.  What?  Whatever?!  (scoffs) Whatever?  Unbelievable!  Ah, whatever.  I can't believe nobody came to save us.  Should we do this?  Let's go be with the gang.  All right.    (tapping sounds)  (ship creaking)      A-And then, uh, you know,  and then we all got pulled up.  I mean, it was a miracle. It was an actual miracle.  Yeah. Hey, I'm sorry, can I stop  Can you just move that light a little bit?  It's really blasting me right in my face. Yeah, it's been  blasting us this whole time. It's kind of blasting all of us.  Can you move the light, please? DEE: Just a little bit?  Sorry about that. Oh, wow!  CHARLIE: So much better.  Should've said something earlier.  Well, harrowing stuff,  but I think I got everything I need.  Could you mark down in your report,  uh, that I'm not gay? Because I'm not. What?  What do you mean, you're not gay? Since when?  He's gay. Oh, well, because  God answered my prayers and saved us.  That means that there is, of course, a God,  and if there is a God, then in his infinite wisdom,  there's no way he would have made me queer.  DEE: Oh. MAC: So I'm-I'm straight.  All righty. Okay. Look, look  are we gonna get in trouble because of this accident?  Uh, nope, you're good to go.  I just needed your report for my insurance claim.  Insurance claim? Y-You're not a cop?  Cop? No, I'm an insurance adjustor.  I'm just collecting reports of people's experiences  for insurance purposes. Oh.  Whew. I'm so relieved.  So, so are we gonna get a payout?  Well, you might have,  had you not just admitted to breaking  several laws.  What? Right, well hang on though.  I mean, we got trapped in a room  by a drunk captain who sunk the ship.  We almost died, man. Yeah, man. Yeah.  No, no, it wasn't the captain's fault. He was sober.  Well, what happened? Whose fault was it?  Nobody's fault. The ship just hit a massive wave during the storm.  In the insurance biz, that is what we call  "an act of God."  Well, God is great.                     1 CHARLIE: So Dennis hasn't even seen the apartment yet?  MAC: No. No. Yeah, Dennis lost a bet, and I got to redesign  our old apartment. He is gonna flip! 
 Ooh. Nice.
 Ah.
 That's great. I'm just  excited to have my old place back to myself.  And guys, after the grand opening,  we finally get a chance to fire 
 (Dee gasps)
 the rocket launcher. 
 Ooh.
 Yes!
 Nice, dude! You got a rocket!  It finally came in the mail, and now we have 
 the perfect opportunity to celebrate with it.
 Oh. 
 CHARLIE: Yeah, that will be good.
 Fire in the hole.  Guys, guys, guys, listen, listen. There's a girl.  She's coming, okay? There's a girl Mandy.  Okay, she's here to stay, all right?  And-and-and you guys have to take my lead because  I'm-I'm another guy, so don't address me 
 as me because I'm somebody else.
 Are we us?  Well, yeah, of course you are.  I don't want to be me. Can I be someone else?  No. You have to be you, okay? All of you are yourselves, 
 except for Dee.
 Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
 Are you right-handed, or left-handed?
 That won't come up. 
 Well, it could come up.
 It won't!  CHARLIE: Okay. I'm gonna go with left then. 
 I'll go with left.
 Cool. Left.  Let's go with the hand that I am, for Christ's sakes.  Hey! Mandy. Hi.  Hey. Ooh.  Why'd you run up ahead of me there, Brian?  Oh, I had to use the bathroom super bad.  MANDY: Oh.  So, this is the hangout spot then, huh?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, these are my friends.  MANDY: Oh, so that 
 must make you Prudence then.
 Yes. 
 Uh-huh. Yes, it does.
 DENNIS: Yeah. 
 MANDY: Oh.
 He is Prudence, 
 and I'm Griffin.
 No, he's Mac!  He's just Mac, so don't Yeah.  And that's Charlie, and that's Frank.  And he's left-handed. 
 Yeah.
 Oh.  I suppose I didn't know that about you.  Yeah. No, well, there was 
 really no reason for it to come up.
 Mama.  Uh, guys, this is, uh, 
 Mandy.
 Hi.  And this is, uh this is little Brian Junior.  Oh.  Yeah. He's my son.    Well, I'm gonna go with left-handed. 
 Left-handed or right-handed, man?
 What's going on here, dude?  All right, look, you guys remember when we did that Boggs thing.  We flew out to California? Well, if you recall,  I actually got off in North Dakota.  Right? Being out of town, I thought, naturally,  I'm gonna have a little bit of fun, you know, so,  I picked up Mandy there at an Applebee's. 
 Oh.
 I was pretending to be  an airline pilot who flies out of Philly named Brian LeFevre.  I went to an old character.  I needed a complete back story for the manipulation. 
 Of course, of course.
 Yeah, but wasn't Prudence Brian's wife?  Yes, but in this scenario, she's my sister.  See, I'm always tweaking things based on the situation.  And needless to say, it worked like a charm.  But, uh, five months later,  she calls me up, tells me she's pregnant. 
 Oh!
 Mm.  Christ, what am I gonna do here? And need I remind you,  once she finds out that I'm not who I said I was,  and that I don't have any money, 
 she could come after the bar.
 DEE: Ah. 
 She could be entitled to that?
 Ah shit.
 All right, guys,  guys, everybody just calm down, all right?  Maybe it's not about money for her. Look, as we all know,  everything is about emotion with women. 
 Right, Dee?
 What?! 
 Whoa.
 Whoa.
 Oh, my God. Whoa! 
 All right, Dee, relax.
 CHARLIE: Oh, whoa. 
 Rrr.
 We're trying to have  a rational conversation, okay? 
 Yeah, we're trying to help our friend here.
 Look, I think the point is,  maybe we got to close the emotion door  for Mandy by telling her that you're gay.  Yeah, right, but I already had sex with her.  How am I gonna convince her I'm gay?  Just go with me here.  Brian's not above having a one-night stand with a woman,  but he's got no room for her emotionally 
 because he's in love with me.
 With you? 
 Well, yes, the lover is me, of course.
 Mm. 
 Next plan.
 FRANK: That plan  stinks, because it's always about money with women.  That's all there is to it.  So I think the best thing to do is  to find a guy who's got more money than you,  like in that movie, uh, Indecent Proposal.  You get a millionaire to bang her for a million bucks.  She takes the money and runs.  Would you sleep with her for a million dollars?  No way. It's too much money.  All right, next plan. Dee.  Yeah, no, I've got a great plan,  but, uh, I'm thinking that this isn't my problem, and, also,  you guys wouldn't listen to me no matter what I said.  Good point. Charlie, plan.  I got it. If I just get  the waitress pregnant, she's gonna be tied to me for life,  so, I got to do that.  He's already on to another thing.  All right, Christ, uh, I got to do something here. 
 Fine. Mac, we'll go with your plan.
 Yeah! 
 Yes! Yes.
 Mm. 
 Is the apartment ready?
 Yes. You are not  gonna believe what I did to it.  Surprise!  Huh. It looks, uh  Exactly the same.  I was able to track down versions of our old furniture,  and even found replicas  of all the knickknacks that burned in the fire. 
 It's bizarre.
 Bizarre in a good way. 
 No.
 You don't like it?  No.  Hey, so, I don't mean to interrupt here, fellas,  but I'm a little bit confused.  You never told me you had a roommate.  It's time, Brian.  Here's where things get a little bit tricky.  Um there's really no easy way to say this,  but, um, Mac and I aren't just friends. 
 He's actually my, uh
 Lover. 
 Partner.
 Yes, well, we do make love. 
 We don't actually make love
 He's the power bottom. 
 Now he generates a tremendous amount of power
 Yeah. No, I 
 from the bottom.
 I don't. I don't, actually. 
 Don't sell yourself short. He does.
 No, no. It's not that I  It's just that we don't have sex.  Yeah, I, uh I sleep with women,  but I'm emotionally involved with Mac,  which is why  and this is the hard part I  I don't really I don't have room emotionally  in my life for you.  Okay. Uh Wow.  Well, I'm a little bit shocked here.  Sure. 
 Mm.
 But I guess the most important thing is  for Brian, Jr. to have a relationship with his father.  And you know, Mac, you seem like a real stand-up fella,  so, if you boys are open to it,  the only thing I can think of better  than Junior having one dad is, well, him having two.  Ee. 
 Yeah. No.
 Wow. I wasn't expecting that.  We're the type of guys that, um  Who would love this.  Oh! (laughs)  (knocking)  Yeah. Coming.  Hey, come on in.  All right, Charlie, you got 15 minutes,  and it's a dollar a minute starting now.  Oh, no.  No, no, no, no. No, we're not doing this. Uh-uh.  Uh, now hear me out. It's not about sex. 
 Okay, good.
 It's about having a baby. 
 And I'm gone.
 Uh, no, no, no, hang on.  Hang on, one Just one second. Come on.  Look, I know you've always wanted a baby, right?  I see you. You poke around the preschools  and the playgrounds, and you got that longing look in your eye.  Oh, God, that's so creepy.  Well, look, I can tell you this.  It  It's not gonna happen for you.  Excuse me?  Yeah, you ain't gonna have a baby. Check this out.  Your life has been on a slow, but steady decline for years.  You were a coffee shop waitress, right?  On-again, off-again troubles with alcohol.  Living in a women's shelter.  And finally, all women's Achilles' heel time.  Okay. Are you done? 
 Because I feel like there's more.
 No. 
 I'm seeing, like, a whole
 Yeah, this is I'm getting to the good part.  Look. Frank will provide for us. 
 Right? He's got tons of money.
 Mm-hmm.  You're never gonna have to work another day in your life. See? Zzz.  All the way to sitting on the beach in Rio de Janeiro.  Driving the lane to fame.  Okay, so  the point is this, life with Charlie and a baby  looking pretty good.  Did you really think that this was gonna work? 
 Did you really think that
 Well  you would just have me in here and you could just  hurl insults at me. 
 Huh?
 I've tried everything for years with you. 
 (chuckles)
 And I just at this point,  I just don't know what else to say.  Oh, my God! Stop saying things to me.  Don't you understand that  this is never gonna happen, so let it go.  Look, w-why? You won't ever tell me why.  You just say no, and you won't give me a shot.  I don't understand what's so terrible about me.  What's so great about me, Charlie?  What's wrong with you?  Why are you so obsessed with me?  I mean, you said it yourself, I'm a mess.  So, why don't you just go find somebody better?  Well  'cause there is no one better.  And  I love you.  Yes.  Those jerks are finally gone.  Time to stretch out around here.  FRANK: Heyo.  What's the haps, Dee?  What are you doing, Frank?  Oh, Charlie's doing a thing at the apartment tonight,  so I'm gonna crash here. 
 Okay?
 No, get a hotel.  You know what, do you mind if I take the bed?  Because I got a little pinched nerve in my neck. 
 It's driving me crazy.
 Wh yeah, I mind.  I'm gonna go take a steam bath,  so why don't you whip me up a bowl of that popcorn.  That smells so good. 
 No. I'm not gonna do that.
 Thanks.  No, no, no, no, no, no. Frank! Stop!  Don't get all emotional, just do it.  I don't want this.  Okay.  They're asleep.  Dude, why did you say you wanted to raise the kid?  I just got caught up in the moment, you know?  It was so exciting.  Maybe we should do it.  W-we? We are not a couple, Mac.  Well, no, we would just keep pretending.  I am not gonna pretend to be in a relationship  with you for the entirety of my child's life.  Are you insane?  Lo okay, you know what? I can't handle this right now.  I'm gonna go sleep in your room.  You can sleep on the couch.  Oh, no w-w-wait, Dennis.  Dennis, Dennis, Dennis.  Uh, hold on one second I-I  What is this?  This is the gym.  Uh-huh.  And where were you going to sleep?  Well, I figured since we got so used to sleeping in the same bed at Dee's,  that we could just sort of 
 continue that here.
 Mm-hmm. 
 You want to sleep on the couch
 (inhales)  together.  I'm gonna sleep next to the dildo bike.  The Ass-pounder, uh, 4000, is an exercise bike.  (door slams)  That was, um  That was not as bad as I expected.  It was amazing.  It kind of was.  It kind of was amazing. 
 Oh, yeah.
 Yeah.  Oh. Hmm.  What is this? What are you doing there? 
 This? Oh, this just
 Yeah.  improves the chances of conception.  Of what?  Of getting pregnant.  Oh. Right.  Uh, the baby.  Right.  Hey, you know, speaking of which, um,  I think we're gonna need to make some changes around here.  Oh. Like what?  Um, well, I think you need to repaint, for starters.  Wh-why would I do that?  Charlie, this this paint could be full of lead.  Are you serious?  I can't carry a baby around lead paint.  Or or, oh, I'm sorry.  Did you expect me to live in the women's shelter  while I'm carrying your child?  Oh, no, um  I hadn't thought about it, but you can stay here. 
 I mean, that's fine.
 Okay.  Oh, wow. Oh, thank you so much.  When this baby comes out, though,  Frank's gonna need to find us a nicer place to live.  Oh, but I love this place.  Okay, well, I don't, and it's no place  to raise a child, so end of conversation.  Whoa.  Hey. Hang on.  You're kind of coming on strong right now. 
 Are you serious right now?
 Well, look  I'm carrying your child. 
 N-n-n-n-n-n-no.
 Carrying my  I am not finished talking.  Who's idea was this in the first place?  Look, I'm just saying if you want to be a mom,  you're gonna have to learn how to control your emotions.  (laughing): I need to control my emotions?  Or I'm not gonna be a good mother?  Oh, my God!  (snoring) 
 (door opens)
 CHARLIE: Dee! 
 I'm in trouble here.
 What? What are you doing here?  The waitress is totally, like, moving into my apartment.  I-I-I can't take it.  I'm gonna need to hide out here for a few days.  No. No. Hard no. Get out.  It's like, I didn't think about the whole, like,  having a baby thing, you know?  It's like one thing to trap a person with a baby,  but then when you actually have a baby,  then you become trapped.  What baby thing? What are you talking about?  And plus, it's totally turning her into, like, a different person.  She's, like, acting like a real bitch now. 
 She's always been a bitch.
 Now who's being a bitch, Dee?  Come on, I need help here, all right?  Look, I-I got to sleep, okay?  I can't think straight. 
 I ah, Christ is he snoring?
 Yeah.  Snoring's the worst. I'm gonna need to crash 
 next to you, all right? You know what?
 What?  Don't be a whore tonight, Dee, and try and bang me again, okay?  Because I got nothing left.  I'm spent; I'm really exhausted.  Too much sex and too much stuff.  Just don't be a whore, okay? 
 (snoring)
 (whines) 
 Dee! Egg!
 Where is it?  Where is it? There's no eggs here. 
 Where are your eggs?
 Dee, where are your eggs?  CHARLIE: Dee, eggs! 
 Dee, we're looking for your eggs.
 Where are your eggs? 
 We can't find them!
 Come on, leave me alone.  Just let me sleep; I barely slept last night.  FRANK: Dee. Deandra.  Look, don't be so emotional.  You're being very emotional.  FRANK: Get up and get us an egg.  I'm getting like calls up the wazoo from the waitress.  She's asking for, like, groceries and shit. 
 I mean, who does that?
 No.  Who-who just barges into someone's apartment 
 and takes over?
 Nobody.  Oh, my God, are you serious?  That's exactly what you guys are doing!  Uh, Dee, eggs, okay? I'm freaking out.  What is happening here?  I just got rid of two annoying roommates.  This is not supposed to be happening. 
 (phone rings)
 God! She's calling me again!  It's like she's totally stalking me. 
 Dee, what do I do here?
 (phone rings)  You have been stalking that woman for 15 years.  Now she's finally showing you some attention,  and you don't like it?  Oh, Dee, you know what? Eggs. 
 I didn't ask for your opinion.
 (door opens)  Yes, you did!  Hey, oh, good, Dee.  I need you to watch Brian Jr. for a few hours. 
 N-n-n-n-n-no.
 Y-y-y-y-yeah.  Frank, what the hell are you doing here, man?  You're supposed to be finding my millionaire.  I'm on it. I'm here trying to get her to make us breakfast. 
 Yeah, we haven't got any eggs.
 I need an egg.  DENNIS: Dee, why have you not made this man his egg?  Do you want to take care of this child for the rest  of your life, is that what you want?  Or do you want me to get out of this situation that I'm in?  (yelling): I'm gonna smash it!  Oh, Dee, don't get emotional.  Christ, if you're upset, smash an egg into a pan for Frank.  Solve problems, don't cause them.  Oh, gee whiz, look how fancy this place is.  We don't have anything like this back in North Dakota.  Oh, yeah? Fascinating.  Um, so, Mandy, um, we have brought you here,  uh, to meet a gentleman. 
 Um, I just feel really
 Oh.  badly now being able to provide emotionally for you,  so I thought we could set you up with somebody  who can provide for you both emotionally  and financially.  Um, so we are here to meet a millionaire.  Oh, geez.  I don't know.  Yeah. No, I know.  It's, a, it's a little str Oh, oh 
 Hey.
 Let's do this. 
 Oh.
 (groans)  Uh, Frank, where's the, uh, millionaire?  I am the millionaire, I'm the guy. 
 What?
 Mandy,  here's what we're gonna do.  I'm gonna make you a decent proposal.  Not an indecent proposal like in the movie  because I think to pay a million bucks to get laid  that's out of the question.  I'm gonna offer you $5,000. 
 What are you doing, Frank?
 Look,  I'm gonna give you $5,000, we bang,  you take the money, you go up, you get on a plane,  you fly to wherever the hell it is in the sticks,  and, uh, you know, $5,000 goes a long way up there.  If you need more money, call me up,  come back, we bang again.  Price goes down 'cause I already had you.  But if you want to bring a girlfriend  (exhales sharply) price goes back up. 
 Well, I don't know what to say here.
 MAC: I do.  Five grand is a lot of money is that offer just out on the table? 
 I'm not gonna bang you.
 I don't want to bang you, either, Frank, 
 but I'll power through for five grand.
 Well, no, you wouldn't want to,  because you're emotionally involved with me.  Aw. Shit. Sorry, Dennis. 
 Hey. Dennis?
 Brian,  I meant. I'm sorry. 
 Yeah, sometimes
 Brian is his name.  Dennis is his sex slave name. 
 He's my gimp.
 What? No. I 
 I don't have a sex slave name.
 Wait. 
 I'm not
 Wait, hold on,  what's going on here, Brian?  FRANK: Look,  I'm gonna go to the can and make my morning move.  You want the cash, you come on in, earn it the hard way.  Okay? If the broad comes,  order me an egg.  (sighs)  Well, that was a disaster. Frank almost ruined everything.  Okay, do you want me to go down to the car and talk to her?  And spin more perverted tales about me? Why am I a gimp?  Oh, God, just get your kid and get out of here, Dennis.  Yeah, I'll get the kid,  but I got to come back because I need to crash here tonight.  I'm not sleeping next to Mac's dildo bike again.  What?  No, me too. Your bed is working wonders for my pinched nerve.  Yeah, you know what? I'm gonna crash here for a little bit too.  I feel like I got to ghost the waitress for a while on this.  I'm gonna stay as well because I need to sleep next to Dennis.  All right, then we're gonna need a lot of eggs. 
 Dee, how about a carton of eggs?
 Ooh!  (all clamoring) 
 No, goddamnit, I didn't want to be wrapped up in this!
 (clamoring stops)  I didn't want to be wrapped up in the kid thing,  that's your mistake.  Listen to me,  I can figure this out, I've got a new plan  and you're all gonna goddamn listen up, okay?  It's time for Brian LeFevre to die. 
 (whispers): Over here. Over here.
 Hmm? 
 Go, go, go, go, go, go.
 What where what is-what is going on here?  I thought-I thought we were gonna go see the Liberty Bell.  There's no time for that, there's no time.  What what is going on here, Brian?  All right, listen to me, because we only have a few minutes  before they realize they can't hear or see us back here.  What? Who?  My name my name isn't Brian LeFevre.  My real name  is Dane Brass.  And I hold top secret government information.  Okay? They're after me, that's-that's why everything's been so weird.  That's why I haven't been able to speak openly with you.  And you and Brian Jr., you'll have to get away from me  because it's-it's not safe.  What do you mean it's not safe? I don't (gasps) Oh, my God. 
 You're bleeding!
 Oh  Oh, oh. (groans) I've been shot. 
 Well, I didn't hear any gun
 (gunshot) 
 (gasps)
 Oh, well  yeah, not there it is there. That was the sound of it.  Normally you'd you'd hear it before you see the blood,  but, uh, not in this case.  (groans) Run! (yells)  Oh, it's killing me. Run, Mandy, no.  You you have to run and not ever look back.  Or contact me ever again.  And you'll never get any money or assets from me  because if you do, it'll be unsafe for you. 
 Run!
 (tires screech)  (moans)  Oh, my God! 
 They got Dennis.
 Dane. 
 Uh, Dane, of course, Dane.
 Dane.  Yeah, he had so many identities, it's hard to remember  FRANK: We got to get him to a hospital!  Not a regular hospital, though, 'cause technically, 
 he's not supposed to exist.
 A bad guy one.  Oh, no, I've lost my lover.  I'll need a new gimp!  DENNIS: I'm not his lover.  Never had sex. Not a gimp.  (groans) Oh, run, Mandy. Oh.  Good-bye. Uh good-bye, Mandy, good-bye.  Brian Jr.  ALL: Aw.  Well, there it is.  Well  okay.  Are you all finished?  (scoffs) Come on.  You can open your eyes now, I know you're not dead.  Ah, geez.  You big city folks sure like to complicate things, don't ya?  Look, all I wanted was for Brian Jr. to have a father,  but we don't want to be with a man who doesn't want to be with us.  So, I guess we'll just  be getting back to North Dakota now.  Okay, now,  you want to come on up here and say good-bye to Brian Jr.?  Oh.  Yeah.  Okay. 
 Hey.
 Yeah.  Hey, buddy.  Um  good-bye and, um  you know, you be  you be good to your mom and, uh  (soft chuckle) 
 Okay, you all done?
 Yeah.  All right. 
 Okay.
 Okay.  Here we go.  Bye, Dada.  Bye.  (sighs) Well, all right.  It was sure nice getting to know you all.  (chuckles) Whoever the heck you are.  ("Genius of Love" by Tom Tom Club plays)  What you gonna do when you get out of jail?   I'm gonna have some fun   What do you consider fun?   Fun, natural fun.   I can't do this.  What are you talking about, bud? The plan worked.  No, this no, this-this is crazy.  What are we doing? I can't I-I can't 
 I can't do any of this shit anymore.
 FRANK: What? 
 (music stops)
 What's going on?  Okay, I'm I'm leaving.  I'm gonna go be a dad.  Well, hold on a-hold on a second, you can't just leave.  FRANK: Yeah, you can't just go become a dad, Dennis.  That's not the way it works.  You don't know the first thing about it.  Well, you know what, Frank, I'll figure it out, okay?  Because I don't want my kid to grow up like I did.  With some asshole dad who was never even around.  You talking about me or Bruce?  You!  Okay, you know what? I this is nuts.  I got to I just got to go.  It's done. It's done, guys.  Good-bye, Paddy's Pub.  Good-bye, Philadelphia.  Good-bye, Charlie.  Mac, Dee, Frank.  The bar's done. 
 CHARLIE: Well, hang on a second.
 Actually, 
 it's not done.
 It's not done, no.  We're still in here.  Shh, just let me 
 Don't start talking, I can tell
 (all talking over each other) 
 We weren't gonna say anything.
 The pause is too big.  Well, this is, again, this is why I'm leaving.  (clamoring)  Oh, good-bye. 
 MAC: Good-bye.
 DEE: Good-bye. 
 Hmm.
 Bye.  Hmm.  I can't believe he's actually gone. 
 Yeah.
 That's crazy.  Well, now what?  (car alarms blaring)  (cheering and clamoring)  What a shot, man!  Oh, my God! 
 Whoa!
 (Mac laughs)  ("Genius of Love" by Tom Tom Club plays)  What you gonna do when you get out of jail?  I'm gonna have some fun   What do you consider fun?   Fun, natural fun.
